And on behalf of our entire company, I'd like to welcome you to our Virtual 2021 Investor Day. Let me first go over some Safe Harbor language. Today, we will be making some forward-looking statements and those statements, those projections are made with the best estimates we have on hand. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. The reconciliation for non-GAAP financial information used in the O&M efficiency ratio can be found in our Investor Day press release and in the appendix of the accompanying slide deck, which has been posted to the Investor Relations page of our website. All statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share, refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. In addition, for the purposes of the presentation, our long-term EPS CAGR range is anchored off of the 2020 earnings per share results. Let me now spend a few minutes on safety, a very important topic for us. So much so that for every meeting we have, we start with a safety message. And you'll see this message woven throughout our presentation today. It's embedded in our culture. There is nothing more important than the safety of our employees and our customers. At the heart of our safety objective is our pursuit of zero injuries at work. You've heard us say that we want to send our employees home at the end of every day in the same or even better condition than when they came to work. A safe and inclusive work environment is key to achieving this path to zero. The safety and health of our team is the reason we decided to hold a Virtual Investor Day this year. The format allows our speakers and those working behind the scenes to remain in remote locations and maintain social distancing. We've practiced these and other COVID-19 safety measures throughout the year for our field teams, as well as those colleagues that work in offices. We're also taking into account all CDC and local and state guidance as we work on plans to return to a more normal state of operations when possible, with safety as our continued primary driver. And with that, I would now like to introduce American Water\u2019s President and CEO, Walter Lynch.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Ed and good morning, everyone. I'm Walter Lynch, President and CEO of American Water. I want to welcome and thank you for taking the time to join us today. We know you have a choice in where to invest your money. We thank you for your confidence in American Water. We're confident that throughout our presentation today, you'll continue to see that we're positioned for success for decades to come. And we continue to have a compelling long-term value profile for you, our owners. We look forward to sharing our story. Before we discuss our agenda today and move to the presentation. I want to echo Ed's message on safety. Nothing matters more to everyone at American Water than the safety of our team and the public. As a company that provides essential services to communities across the country and an employer of more than 7,000 people with families and loved ones, no injury is ever acceptable to us. Safety is embedded in everything we do and is that the foundation, the plane will lay out for you today. Turning to our next slide. As outlined in our press release issued yesterday, American Water continues to execute on our strategies and we're well positioned for long-term success. Today, I'll start by discussing our strategic focus and our commitment to building and maintaining reliable and resilient water and wastewater infrastructure, cultivating an inclusive high performing culture, delivering water and wastewater solutions, where we create value for customers and communities and continuing our commitment to being a values-led company. Bill Varley, our Chief Growth Officer will discuss our regulated growth strategy. Cheryl Norton, our Chief Environmental Officer and President of New Jersey American Water will talk about our commitment to ESG principles and our new, and we think critical environmental targets. And Susan Hardwick, our Chief Financial Officer will cover in more detail, our 2021 guidance and long-term business plan along with our strong 2020 results. We'll then look forward to answering your questions. Everything we'll discuss today starts with a clear, transparent strategy. We've been providing essential water and wastewater services dating back to 1886. Our success is rooted in our values of safety, trust, environmental leadership, teamwork, and high-performance, and the strategies we built around our safety, people, operational excellence, growth and customers. As we look to the future and our long-term success. Today, I want to spend some time and how we'll continue to create value for all our stakeholders. This starts with operating where we can leverage our strengths, including areas where we have customer concentrations. Fragmentation has long been a challenge for water and wastewater providers across the United States. But for American Water, we're able to focus our resources and efforts where we have scale, where we can drive efficiencies, invest in reliable and resilient infrastructure while enhancing our customer's experience and keeping their bills affordable. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of clean, safe, reliable water, and wastewater services like never before, by strategically focusing our resources, we strengthen our operations and continue to provide excellent local customer service. This strategic effort also provides greater opportunities to deliver meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities building on our proven success. Last year, we invested more capital than any previous year. We continued our disciplined focus in O&M efficiencies. We added approximately 38,000 customer connections through acquisitions in 10 states. And we were recently named one of the Top 10 World's Most Sustainable Corporations by Corporate Knights. Now we'll build upon that success by continuing to hone our strengths. There's no other water and wastewater service provider with our scaling capabilities. We're uniquely positioned to help our country address long existing water and wastewater challenges and strengthen the communities that we're privileged to serve. And that starts with the dedicated and talented people of American Water. This goes beyond investing in training. It's an intentional long-term commitment to building and hiring talent, inspiring and rewarding high-performance, creating fulsome development paths and building a strong, diverse team. A perfect example of our bench strength is last week's news that Cheryl Norton has been named American Water's Chief Operating Officer, effective March 1. We\u2019re so pleased to have Cheryl take on this key leadership role for our company. Cheryl has deep utility experience, a strong commitment to safety, a passion for excellent customer care and a collaborative approach to building high performing teams. Importantly, she fully embraces our values and the culture we continue to build at American Water. We're cultivating deeply committed and passionate teams that care about our customers, our communities, and each other. Let me take a moment to talk about our business and the continued execution of our strategies. American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse water and wastewater utility in the United States. We have more than 7,000 employees who provide drinking water, wastewater, and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 46 states. We provide services to customers through our two business segments, our regulated business, and our market-based businesses. Our regulated business is our core business, providing more than 89% of our projected EPS by 2025. We own and operate a significant amount of assets, including more than 53,000 miles of pipes, 609 water treatment plants, 150 wastewater treatment plants, 1,100 wells and 75 dams. We treat and deliver more than 1 billion gallons of water every day for our customers. Our market based businesses include homeowner services and our military services group, which I'll speak to in a moment. Before we move on to the next slide let me comment on recent transactions that illustrate the execution of our strategy. As you know, we're in the process of selling our operations in New York, and we recently signed an agreement to sell our Michigan operation. We're working on additional opportunities that will further strengthen our presence in states where we're eager to grow. We expect to have more to share on that in the very near future. These agreements and other opportunities that we're exploring are a key part of our strategy to operate in states where we can best serve customers, drive efficiencies and continue to grow through regulated investment and acquisitions. I would also note that Pennsylvania-American Water was the successful bidder to acquire the wastewater treatment and collection system for the city of York, Pennsylvania. We're currently working through the approval process. This potential agreement would add an equivalent customer connection total of about 45,000 and would be another example of growing where we can add value. Let's turn to our long-term growth story on Slide 9, covering our five-year plan. You'll recognize our projected growth triangle, now reflecting a larger growth expectation from regulated acquisitions. This plan also reflects our increasing capital plan. There continues to be a significant need to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, not just within our system, but broadly across the United States. On the water side, there are 1 million miles of pipes in the United States, and there's a major main break every two minutes. The country loses about 2 trillion gallons of treated water every year through more than 240,000 main breaks. That's roughly 20% of all treated water in the United States. On the wastewater side, through about 800,000 miles of collection pipes in the United States, many of those pipes are in dire need of replacement and pose a risk to groundwater. Every year, nearly a trillion gallons of untreated sewage are discharged into our rivers and streams. We understand the urgent need for a well-planned and executed asset renewal and upgrade plan to drive monetization, improve efficiency and increase reliability and resiliency. Our 2021 to 2025 capital plan includes an increase of $1.3 billion, reflecting the continued needs in our existing systems, as well as the increase in potential regulated acquisitions. Bill Varley will give more detail on our pipeline of acquisition opportunities in a moment. We expect our market-based businesses to contribute about 1% of our growth over the next five years, compared to our prior plan. This slightly lower growth rate is not a reflection of slower growth at our market-based businesses, but rather the increasing growth potential we see from regulated acquisitions. As a reminder, our capital-light market-based businesses generate cash as well as enhance our customer experience. And again, we're incredibly proud to provide water and wastewater services to the men and women of our military at 17 installations. These components of our triangle give us confidence that we can continue to grow our long-term EPS CAGR of 7% to 10% over the next five years. Let me now talk about our capital plan in greater detail. We're committed to providing safe and reliable water and wastewater services to the hundreds of communities we serve. We achieve this level of service by incorporating established best practices in our operations and implementing an investment strategy that balances infrastructure needs with affordability for our customers. American Water has a demonstrated ability to service and maintain distribution and treatment infrastructure, including improving water quality, fixing leaks, and providing water for fire hydrants to name just a few. These efforts help communities remain strong and attractive to residents and businesses. We plan to spend $1.9 billion in 2021 and about $10.4 billion over the next five years. Again, that's a $1.3 billion increase over the plan we share with you last year. The largest component of this investment is infrastructure renewal, which is primarily for pipe replacement and upgrading water and wastewater treatment facilities. Over the next five years, we plan to replace about 2,200 miles of pipes and makes significant upgrades to our water and wastewater facilities across our footprint. We're also making needed investments to enhance water quality, as well as taking steps to improve our water sources. Every water provider must be prepared to address a broader range of contaminants and be ready to meet more stringent regulations. Finally, we'll invest in new technologies to enhance our customer experience and enable our employees to drive efficiencies. On the longer horizon, you can see that we plan to spend approximately $22 billion to $25 billion in our regulated business over the next 10 years. American Water's investment thesis is unique because the predictable and stable way we deploy our capital. Our capital deployment is made up of many small investments across our footprint, which gives us the flexibility to scale our infrastructure investment plan up and down as capital needed for regulated acquisitions may vary because of deal timing. You can see that we set aside $3 billion to $4 billion for regulated acquisitions. Let me also point out that our capital investment generates significant economic benefits to the local and regional economies. According to the U.S. Water Alliance for every million dollars, we invest in our infrastructure. We create 15 high paying jobs for our communities. So our plan investment of about $10.4 billion over the next five years has the potential to create over 156,000 jobs in the communities we serve. Let's move to Slide 11 and discuss how we balance the investment opportunities with customer affordability. This is a holistic approach focused on operating and capital efficiencies, constructive regulatory and legislative policies and leveraging the size and scale of our business. It comes down to driving efficiencies in areas where we've been successful, effectively leveraging technology, taking advantage of our size and scale for supply chain, not only around price, but access to critical supplies and driving our cost management through a culture of continuous improvement. When we achieve smart O&M reductions, we can invest in our water and wastewater systems while mitigating the impact on our customer's bills. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, which I'll discuss in a moment. We reinforce our operational efficiency efforts by also focusing on capital efficiency. We understand that driving capital efficiency allows us to do more with the same amount of money. We employ a value engineering step in all our large projects to optimize costs and performance of a project. We also continue to receive timely recovery of our investments through regulatory mechanisms across our footprint. These mechanisms reduce regulatory lag and extend the time between general rate case filings, which enables us to mitigate the size of any rate increase. I would note that 64% of capital recovery comes from regulatory mechanisms. We continue to engage with policymakers in similar efforts to support critical investments in solutions to water and wastewater challenges. Finally, our large customer base plays an important part, minimizing customer bill impact for this needed investment. We're able to spread the cost of these investments over a large customer base. And again, leverage our efficiencies to minimize customer bill impact. As you know, small water systems across the country aren\u2019t able to do this as they grapple with aging infrastructure and contaminants that threaten the quality of their drinking water. Let's move to Slide 12 for other ways, where strategically managing costs. We take a strategic approach to managing our costs, centered on deploying, enabling technology, leveraging our supply chain and embracing our culture of continuous improvement. Our technology is three areas of focus, enabling our employees, enhancing our customer experience and driving best-in-class operations. Technology enables us to drive efficiencies in our business and to provide an excellent customer experience, whether it's through automating manual tasks so employees can focus on higher value work, making data available to customers so they can better manage their usage or leveraging automatic meter reading solutions with an intelligent alert system to detect and fix leaks earlier. We continue to drive efficiencies through our supply chain. Just last year, we saved over $80 million by leveraging our buying power across our business. For example, we saved more than $50 million on pipes and vehicles, and we replicated this effort in other areas such as chemicals, valves, construction materials, and safety supplies. Our team has established strong relationships with key suppliers to ensure we have priority when items are essential to operating our business or in short supply. This was especially important during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. None of this would be possible without our people. Our employees are passionate about our customers and know how savings directly benefit them by keeping their bills affordable. We enable our employees to find better, more efficient ways to work. This is our culture, and it's been so instrumental to our success in driving efficiencies. Our employees understand that for every operating dollar we take out of the business, we can invest $8 in capital with no customer bill impact. Moving to Slide 13. You can see that we continue to make steady progress and driving efficiencies in our business. Over the past 10 years, our O&M efficiency ratio has gone from 46.1% to below 35%. And we've challenged ourselves with a new O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025. We're confident in our ability to hit that target. Just to put that into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since that time, we welcomed approximately 322,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1%. That could only be done with the great work of our employees and our commitment to controlling costs and keeping bills affordable for our customers. Our market-based businesses are complimentary to our regulated business, they\u2019re capital-light businesses, and they provide positive cash flow to help us with our growth in the overall business. Homeowner services now serves approximately 1.5 million customers, reaching that customer milestone is a testament to our ongoing dedication and commitment to serving our customers, delivering quality protection programs and fostering innovation in the home warranty sector. Our military services group is the largest provider of water and wastewater services for the military, now probably serving 17 installations across the country. We were also extremely honored in 2020 to be awarded Department of Defense contracts for the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State. It's truly an honor to serve the men and women who serve our country. Let's turn to the next slide and I'll conclude my remarks before turning it over to Bill. We have a clear strategy focused on what we do best. Our future success is based on our proven success. Our long-term perspective has informed our business strategy and it starts by operating where we can create value, leverage our critical mass, drive efficiencies and increase opportunities to provide water and wastewater solutions. Our regulated investment remains the foundation of our growth and we'll balance that investment through strategic cost management. We'll continue to focus on our customers and enhance their experience through technology, efficiencies and innovation. Our market-based businesses will continue to compliment our regulated business through operating results, free cash flow, and an enhanced customer experience. And finally, it's not just what we do, but how we do it. That's at the core of our ESG philosophy. It's who we are today and how we plan to challenge ourselves in the future. Let me now turn the call over to Bill to talk about our strategic growth.\nBill Varley: Thanks, Walter. Hi. I'm Bill Varley, Chief Growth Officer for American Water. Prior to my current role, I've held many leadership positions at our company, including President of New Jersey American Water, Senior Vice President for the Northeast and Midwest divisions and Deputy COO. Before I review our growth strategy, let's take a look at the landscape of the utility industry in general. Our industry is highly fragmented, there are more than 50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States compare that to the U.S. electric utilities, which are comprised of approximately 3,800 systems and gas utilities, which are even more consolidated with approximately 1,400 system. The water industry's fragmentation provides ample opportunities for systems consolidate and bring efficiencies across the entire sector. To put that in perspective on the water side, 84% of the population is served by municipal water systems. And more than 90% of those systems serve a population of 10,000 people or less. This is significant for two reasons. First, these numbers illustrate the large volume opportunities available. Second, many of these smaller communities are facing infrastructure challenges that require capital investment, due to competing priorities funds may or may not be readily available. And the large amount of capital invested required must be distributed across a small customer. This can significantly impact rates and affordability. Because of our scale, we're able to spread capital investment costs over a much larger customer base, help we can maintain affordability for our customers. Opportunities on the wastewater side are also significant because many of these systems are already part or near our water footprint. This gives us the opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure and drive operational and cost efficiencies. Let's move to the next slide. Beyond our scale, other competitive advantages include a large customer base. Let me take you through an example where both scale and a large customer base played an important role prior to New Jersey American Water acquiring the water and wastewater systems of Haddonfield, New Jersey, the town faced the daunting need to invest over $20 million in capital improvements over a short timeframe. This investment was required to maintain compliance for their wastewater system and to make necessary improvements to their aging water infrastructure. These costs would have significantly increased rates for their 10,000 customer connections. When New Jersey American Water purchase Haddonfield system, we're able to spread the capital costs across a customer base of over 650,000 connections throughout New Jersey. Our ability to leverage scale of our footprint enables us to accelerate the capital program. At the same time, rate impacts were far less than if the town had decided to do the work themselves. Deep utility experience and expertise was also relevant in Haddonfield, as it is in other acquisitions. We have a culture of continuous improvement and our employees are passionate about finding solutions and serving our customers Technology and purchasing capabilities along with our culture of continuous improvement, also bring added benefits. As Walter mentioned, for every dollar of O&M costs, we can remove from the business. We can invest $8 of capital without increasing customer bills. Another advantage is our ability to acquire wastewater systems within or near our water footprint. Our water operations make up approximately 93% of our business while wastewater is only 7%. This presents a tremendous opportunity because we have the operational infrastructure, equipment, expertise, personnel, and relationships with communities where we already provide water services. It's a natural transition to acquire wastewater services. And it is an important piece of our growth strategy. We've executed multiple successful wastewater acquisitions adjacent to and within states with existing water operations, for example, in Scranton and Exeter, Pennsylvania, we added 31,000 and 9,000 wastewater customer connections, respectively. And in Illinois, we had 23,000 wastewater customer connections. Let's now move to the next slide and see how regulatory and legislative policy also helps drive water and wastewater solutions. We continue to engage with state legislators and regulators on policies, which we believe benefit existing and future customers. Let's talk about three examples, fair market value legislation, consolidated tariffs and legislation around water quality, accountability. Fair market value legislation enables communities to receive a fair value for their systems, in turn the water or wastewater purchaser earns on the appraised value of the system, rather than the book value as was historically the case. The appraised value is then included in rate base as long as the commission is deemed reasonable. The latest states within our footprint to enact fair market value legislation include West Virginia and Iowa. 10 out of the 15 states we serve now have some form of fair market legislation. Next is consolidated tariffs, we have that legislation now in 12 states. This legislation allows us to purchase systems, integrate them into our operations and share those costs across a bigger customer base, minimizing customer bill impact. The last example is the water quality accountability legislation, which directly benefits customers and communities, as it holds all water providers to the same standards. The first state to enact this was New Jersey with the Water Quality Accountability Act. This act requires cybersecurity programs, capital asset management programs, and responding to notices of violations in the same way across all systems. Additionally, it requires all systems to establish a maximum 150 year pipe replacement program to help ensure infrastructure reliability. At American Water, our pipe replacement rate is slightly over 100 years. Because of our asset management program we remain well positioned in New Jersey and across our footprint to meet these requirements. We have seen other states adopt similar legislations, such as Indiana and Missouri. Let's now shift our attention to updating you on our acquisition activities. Since 2015, we've completed 106 acquisitions and have added over 211,000 customer connections. Of the 106 acquisitions, 62 were water acquisitions, totaling 52,000 connections. 44 were wastewater adding 159,000 customers. In 2020, we completed 23 acquisitions in 10 states, totaling approximately 38,000 customer connections. Regarding our focus to increase our wastewater acquisitions of the 38,000 customer connections added over 24,000 were wastewater. This total does not include over 14,500 customer connections attributed to organic growth. We're off to a good start in 2021 with a total of 27 acquisitions under agreement in six states, representing approximately 30,000 customer connections. As you can see, we've increased our five-year opportunity pipeline by 50% over the past year, from 800,000 customer connections to over 1.2 million. When developing our pipeline, we first look to our optimal target range of 5,000 to 50,000 customer connections. Then we conduct the evaluation. This evaluation is not just focused on financial needs, but also looking to provide solutions for potential water quality, operational and wastewater compliance needs, challenges that are increasingly burdensome to communities. Other criteria that we use to evaluate opportunities include enhancing the quality of life for residents and local businesses, whether it be economic development for growth, social programs, or overall community services to name a few. Once systems have been identified, we proactively engage with the communities to see where and how we can provide solutions. You can see on the right here are some of the targets we're working on over the next five years. This list clearly shows that our growth is not contingent on any one deal, but multiple deals across our footprint. And as you can also see the size of these potential deals is also increasing. Let's take a moment to discuss the process and the timeline of acquisition from opportunity assessment, development of agreements to the final close and inclusion in rate base. This process can take a minimum of 18 months to several years to complete, usually starts with a robust bid and procurement process, community approval, regulatory approval and then the final inclusion in rate base as part of a general rate case. Our increased pipeline, our proactive approach to engage in communities and our competitive advantages position as well to achieve our EPS growth target related to acquisitions. Regarding New York, Pennsylvania, in January of this year, Pennsylvania American Water was a successful bidder to quiet the wastewater treatment collection system for the city of New York. We are currently working through the process, but this potential agreement were in an equivalent of 45,000 customer connections, it also shows how American Water plays a role in providing solutions for communities and enhancing the lives of the customers we serve. Let's move to the last slide. In summary, as we've added more capital to our plan, our regulated acquisition target has been raised from 1% to 2% to 1.5% to 2.5%. We tend to achieve this by executing on fundamentals, which are a continued focus on water system acquisitions in our target range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers and consideration for larger acquisitions where appropriate, a focus on wastewater acquisitions in or near a water footprint, continuing engagement on legislative and regulatory policy to benefit customers and an increased development of our opportunity pipeline through a proactive approach. By executing on our fundamentals, we firmly believe are well positioned to meet our increased growth targets. Now I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk about ESG.\nCheryl Norton: Thank you, Bill; and good morning, everyone. I'm Cheryl Norton, Chief Environmental Officer of American Water and President of New Jersey American Water. As Walter said earlier, I'm a great example of the value that American Water places on the development of its employees. My career began at American Water 34 years ago, when I was hired as a temporary employee at our central lab in Belleville, Illinois. And on March 1, I will become the Chief Operating Officer. The path that I've taken to get here today has given me a broad base of experience across multiple states and multiple areas of the business. My start with American Water as a microbiology research technician gave me a unique perspective on water quality, which I continued to build on throughout the years. It's been fun to reconnect with those roots in the Chief Environmental Officer role. I've worked in Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and New Jersey, and I even spent a few months in West Virginia. My leadership roles in these States allowed me to become familiar with operational challenges across the business. I've also experienced a wide range of regulatory and legislative environments and can directly relate to the efforts that Walter and Bill mentioned, and the importance to the business and our customers. My success is a direct result of the amazing people that I've worked with over the years, who've been willing to teach me the business and allow me to bring my whole self to work. I'm honored and grateful to have the opportunity to give back by mentoring and helping others find their path here at American Water. In the future, I'll be here to talk to you about the industry leading operations across American Water, but today, I'm excited to talk to you about our ESG efforts. At American Water, ESG is core to our business and integral to our success. It's who we are, what we do and how we do it. Living by ESG principles is our commitment to operate in the most responsible manner possible. ESG is a constantly evolving journey for us. The information that we gather for various reports is used internally to guide our strategy, as well as externally for investors. We categorize our reporting topics into five key areas, which includes stakeholder engagement, workforce, customers, infrastructure and environmental stewardship. We confirm those topics with various internal and external stakeholders. We know that each stakeholder group brings a valuable perspective that helps inform our priorities. ESG is not simply environmental, social or governance, it's the sum of all three areas coming together and overlapping with our corporate values and strategy. The culture at American Water is what makes us who we are and our employees throughout our business understand that how we do things matters just as much as what we do. Let's talk about some of the data that represents the social pillar and the progress that we've been making. Our focus on inclusion and diversity continues at American Water with improvements in areas such as talent attraction, retention and development. During 2020, 84% of job requisitions had a diverse candidate pool with approximately 59% of transfers and/or promotions filled by minority, female, veteran or disabled individuals. In 2020, we named a Chief Inclusion Officer and a Director of Inclusion and Diversity. These roles will work with leaders all across our business to help ensure our progress continues. We are also very proud of our nationally recognized supplier diversity program. In 2021, our goal is to achieve a diverse supplier and small business spend of 27.6%, an increase of approximately 10% over 2020 results. We recognized the importance of these efforts to our company and the communities we serve. Regarding safety, if we don't get safety, right, nothing else matters. We have a long-term target of zero injuries and our employees work tirelessly to keep each other safe. Our 2020 safety performance was the best in the company's recorded history, despite this great improvement that performance represents 63 injuries and that's 63, too many. Our focus on safety has driven a 67% reduction in workplace injuries over the past five years, which is 81% better than the industry average. But being an industry leader isn't good enough, and so we get to zero injuries, we still have work to do, and our focus will continue. We understand the importance of developing our teams and we've increased our target for annual training for all employees from 20 hours to 25 hours for 2021. During 2020, our employees completed more than 100,000 hours of safety training, in addition to other important training. This is a significant statistic considering that due to COVID-19 almost all of that training was done virtually. Turning to our environmental goals. After completing a thorough goal benchmarking process, we identified three opportunities to build on our previous work. We're excited to share with you a measurement clarification to our existing energy and emissions goal, and two new goals regarding water efficiency and water resiliency. We're clarifying our existing energy and emissions goal to include specifics around measurement. The goal has been adjusted to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40% by 2025 from our 2007 baseline. As a reminder, the vast majority of energy consumed by water utilities is used to pump water. In fact, roughly 4% of all the electricity in the U.S. is used for the treatment and transport of water, around 90% of our total electricity consumption and over 80% of our greenhouse gas emissions are related to the pumping of water. Our path to reduce energy consumption and emissions is driven by using water more efficiently. Through year end 2019, we had reduced greenhouse gas emissions by over 32%, which puts us at 80% of our 2025 goal. By continuing to improve energy and water efficiency, increasing procurement of renewable energy and modifying our fleet, we're on track to meet this target by 2025. Our two new long-term goals are focused on water efficiency and resiliency. By 2035, we will reduce the amount of water delivered per customer by 15% compared to a 2015 baseline. And by 2030, we will improve our water system resiliency by increasing our utility resilience index or URI weighted average by 10% from a 2020 baseline. These goals are the right thing to do for the communities we serve and they will enhance our leadership position in ESG. Let me talk about our two new goals in more detail. As a water company, we have a responsibility to our customers and the environment to be as efficient as possible. That's why we're committed to meeting our customer's water needs, while simultaneously saving 15% in water delivered per customer compared to a 2015 baseline. Over the past five years, we've already accomplished a 4.3% reduction in water delivered per customer, and in the future, we'll expand best practices from our existing conservation programs, utilize innovative technologies like AMI and leak detection and leverage the transparency that we gained through these programs to identify and eliminate sources of water loss faster. By investing capital to improve system performance, we can reduce water loss and non-revenue water, while minimizing customer rate impacts. In addition, we'll continue to benefit from the ongoing national trends of declining residential water use related to fixtures and appliances. Our third environmental goal is to increase our water system resiliency to prepare for and respond to more extreme events. We'll do that by improving the weighted average of our utility resilience index or URI from our 2020 baseline. Our target is a 10% improvement by 2030. Recent history shows that the frequency and severity of weather events, as well as the stress on water supplies related to scarcity, flooding and contamination events, makes the resiliency of our systems more important than ever. We spend approximately 8% of our total capital investment on resiliency projects each year to address these risks and maintain continuous service to our customers. Another key factor in resiliency is the preparedness of our employees. We continue to strengthen our workforce through incident management training and emergency preparedness. We often go beyond our workforce and include contractors and community partners in our emergency response planning and drills. This approach not only makes our response plans stronger, it builds trust and valuable relationships with the communities we serve. Let's take a minute to look at what the URI is in a bit more detail. It's a part of the American Water Works associations, risk and resilience management of water and wastewater standard, also known as the J-100 standard. It's made up of three categories, our people, our assets and the communities we serve. It calculates a utility's ability to respond to and recover from extreme events, including severe weather, environmental incidents, cyber attacks, supply chain disruptions and more. A higher average index percentage indicates that we're able to return to normal operations more quickly, there will always be some element of risk, so this assessment doesn't offer the potential for a perfect score. Best-in-class scores range from 60% to 70%. Our 2020 baseline of approximately 66% weighted average across our footprint is well within that range. Our goal to improve by 10% will further help us be prepared for whatever extreme event may arise. To be frank, measuring our performance in this way sets us apart from others in the sector, to our knowledge, we are the only company holding ourselves to this high standard. In closing American Water is a proven leader in ESG and our new long-term goals are designed to solidify our leadership role. We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve water efficiency and ensure that our systems are leading the industry in resiliency. It is what we do. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Susan.\nSusan Hardwick: Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning, it's good to be with you virtually this morning. And we certainly look forward to doing this in person, hopefully very soon. I'm Susan Hardwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Water. You have just heard from my colleagues, the various elements of our strategy. Let me now translate what that means to our financial plan. But before we get into our longer-term financial outlook, let me take you through the highlights of our strong 2020 results. In the fourth quarter of 2020, earnings were $0.80 per share, compared to $0.54 per share in the same period of 2019, an increase of $0.26 per share. Results for the regulated business increased $0.01 per share and results from the market-based business increased $0.22 per share. Parent company results improved $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. Consolidated results reflect a two set per share benefit from depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting in 2020 related to the pending New York sale, and the loss of $0.19 per share on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 earnings were $3.91 per share compared to $3.43 cents per share in the same period of 2019, an increase of $0.48 per share. Earnings in the regulated business increased $0.33 per share, while the market-based business results improved $0.24 per share compared to 2019. Parent company results were $0.09 per share lower in 2020 as compared to 2019, due primarily to higher interest expense. Regulated results reflect an estimated $0.10 per share, favorable impact year-over-year due to warmer and drier than normal weather across several of the company's subsidiaries in 2020 and unusually wet weather conditions in 2019. Regulated results also include the impact of increased revenues from new rates in effect, as well as earnings from acquisitions offset somewhat by higher wages and related costs and other maintenance costs. Operation and maintenance costs and depreciation also increased in support of growth in the business. And finally, regulated results reflect $0.06 per share benefit from depreciation not recorded as required by the assets held for sale accounting in 2020. Market-based business results improved compared to 2019 from the addition of installations for the Military Group and new partnerships and price increases in the Homeowner Services Group. As a reminder, results in 2019 reflect a $0.19 per share loss on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, results for the full year 2020 included an estimated $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the homeowner services group from increased claims that likely have resulted from more work from home activity. For the regulated business, as we have mentioned throughout much of 2020, we have been working with regulators to secure the opportunity to defer for future recovery, many of the impacts of the pandemic. And we did see as expected that an increase in residential demand largely offset the lower demand in the commercial sector. Our solid performance in 2020 is the basis for our long-term outlook. And as Walter highlighted for you, that outlook is quite strong. Referring to Slide 31, we are establishing the EPS guidance for 2021 of $4.18 to $4.28 per share, compared to our weather normalized results of $3.84 per share for 2020. Our expectation for 2020 run reflects a year-over-year growth rate of over 10%, which is what we indicated would occur at our Analyst Day last year. In longer-term, we are maintaining our growth outlook of 7% to 10% over the next five years anchored off of 2020 results. The foundation of our growth as both Bill and Walter mentioned is our investment in rate base through acquisition and upgrades to our existing systems. As you've heard today, we are stepping up our expected investment in both of these areas. And I think the important thing here is to continue to emphasize that there are multiple decades of capital investment opportunity in the regulated business. I should also add that the market-based businesses do not require a lot of capital, but do incrementally add to our earnings growth expectation, as we have continued to show on our growth triangle. As you can see now though, that expected contribution is slightly lower at about 1% as the expected growth through acquisitions has grown to a larger slice of the triangle. As shown on Slide 33, for 2021, we expect to invest $1.9 billion in our regulated operations. You can see the breakdown between the investment in the existing system, which feeds the bottom part of our growth triangle and the expected regulated acquisition spend, which feeds the mid part of our growth triangle. Over the next five years, we expect to spend between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion, a $1.3 billion increase in capital investment compared to last year's five year plan. Of that increased amount, the split is roughly even between acquisitions and infrastructure investment in our existing systems. And our expected 10 year capital investment plan now stands at the $22 billion to $25 billion range, an increase of $2 billion to $3 billion from last year's 10 year outlook. Our rate-based growth expectation remains a very strong 7% to 8%. In absolute terms you can see on Slide 34, that we have grown rate-base by 50% since 2010 to an estimated $15 billion at the end of 2020. Let's transition to how we intend to finance operations and the capital plan that we have just announced over the next five years, turning to Slide 35. As expected we will rely primarily on our operating cash flows to finance the business. We expect operating cash flows to be roughly $8.5 billion over the next five years, we're planning to raise a total of $3.6 billion of long-term debt, net of maturity repayments over the next five years, coupled with about $700 million of equity needs, which is up slightly from the $500 million we discussed as part of last year's plan. That combined with the proceeds from our New York American sale of roughly $500 million will finance this five year plan. If you are thinking back to the same discussion last year, this current plan represents an increased investment of about $1.3 billion as we've said. That increment will be financed with increased cash flow from operations, as we roll the plan forward a year, additional expected cash proceeds from the New York sale as we have refined our estimated tax obligation upon the sale and additional public equity and debt financing. The incremental need will be financed with about 54% equity sources and 46% debt, which is supportive of our focus on the balance sheet strength and our overall debt to total capital goal. As I mentioned, a key source of financing is cash flow from operations. As a regulated business, it is important that we timely earn and collect a return on the investment. To that end, we continue to be very active on the regulatory front. Recall our discussion with you last year that several of our larger States were expected to be conducting general rate cases throughout much of 2020. As those and other proceedings have progressed, the regulated businesses have received $151 million of annualized new revenue since the start of 2020. And this includes $56 million from rate cases and $95 million from infrastructure surcharges. We are awaiting final orders on four rate cases and two infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $208 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. Let me take a minute to provide an update on the developments in the rate case proceeding of Pennsylvania American. As was mentioned on the third quarter earnings call in October of 2020 Pennsylvania, American Water and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement entered into a settlement agreement, providing for a total annualized revenue increase of $71 million over a two year period. In November 2020, the company\u2019s Pennsylvania subsidiary and the remaining active parties in the case presented their positions and briefs to the administrative law judge, who issued to the Pennsylvania public utility commission a recommended decision approving the settlement. The procedural schedule in this case was extended to March 15, 2021. The company expects the Pennsylvania PUC to issue a final order by the end of the first quarter, and once approved by the PUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 28, 2021. Now turning back to the big picture on Slide 37. As we execute on this plan over the next five years, it is very important for us to maintain a healthy balance sheet. As you know, we have maintained an A credit rating at S&P and a Baa1 at Moody\u2019s. We believe this plan, both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it, is supportive of those current credit ratings. We are proud of our strong credit profile and we continue to work hard and maintaining it for the benefit ultimately of our customers. The upper right of Slide 37 is our debt to total capital metric. You can see that this new plan will position us at approximately a 59% to 60% debt to total cap ratio, where we indicated last year, we would be \u2013 and notably down from the 62% at the end of 2020. The bottom left of the slide shows our debt maturity profile for the next five years. This is a very manageable refinancing profile, which we worked very hard to achieve. We have had very favorable debt capital market transactions over the past several years that have allowed us to effectively build this financing structure. Also on this slide, you can see a glimpse at our liquidity, both now and what we expect at the terminal year of this five year plan. Our current cash balance of $547 million includes the proceeds of the $500 million term loan we entered into in March, 2020 to ensure adequate funds to meet our liquidity needs amid the disruption of short-term commercial paper markets at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The term loan comes due in March of this year. Even without the term loan our $2.25 billion line of credit affords us plenty of capacity to the extent we need it. And finally, on Slide 38, let me just reiterate the compelling story of American Water. We remain confident that we can grow earnings in the 7% to 10% range over the next five year period. American Water remains one of the fastest growing utilities in the entire utility sector. We have also delivered top quartile utility dividend growth while maintaining a payout ratio target of 50% to 60% and remain committed to continuing that as we expect to grow our dividend at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We commit to maintaining our predominantly regulated risk profile with the regulated businesses providing 89% of our 2025 projected EPS. The foundation of this business is regulated operations, and we currently expect to invest between $22 billion and $25 billion over the next decade on water quality and the safety and security of our water infrastructure. The combination of our EPS and dividend growth continues to be a top performer in the utility sector on total shareholder return. As you can see on the right side of this slide, we have delivered an annualized total shareholder return of 182% over the past five years. This is a business that is fundamentally very strong and we continue to deliver excellent outcomes to all of our stakeholders. We are very proud to be able to do that. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Walter for some closing remarks.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you, Susan. Proven and predictable financial performance is an outcome of the successful execution of our strategies. I think you've clearly heard today that we're confident in our long-term success. This confidence is rooted in our strengths, it starts and ends with our unwavering commitment to safety. To us, safety is more than just the right thing to do. The health and safety of our team is a leading indicator of our company's health. Simply put, if we can get safety, right, we can get everything else right. To excel we must get the fundamentals, right. Operational excellence helps us define better and more efficient ways to do business and it enables us to provide safe, clean and affordable water services for our customers. As the largest water and wastewater company in United States, we assume the responsibility to go beyond minimum requirements and be an industry leader in operational and environmental excellence. This can only be achieved by collaborative high-performing teams. Maintaining an environment, where our people feel valued, included and empowered it\u2019s critical to our ability to serve customers every day. We're working together to create an environment where employees can live up to their fullest potential and feel confident that they can directly contribute to our company's ability to stay strong, grow and make a difference in our customer's lives. And making a difference for our customers and for the communities we serve is centered on providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges. When we grow, we're able to leverage our scale, we can invest more, we can create stable jobs and we can improve infrastructure and make communities stronger, and for some ESG is a relatively recent development. For American Water, it's an affirmation of the values we've upheld for decades, it's much broader than just three words, it includes environmental leadership and sustainability, operational excellence, employee engagement, safety and equality, active community engagement, civic and charitable involvement and transparency and good governance. All are foundational to our corporate strategy. Turning to Slide 41. American Water has been recognized for our leadership and ongoing commitment to integrating ESG principles throughout our business. From sustainability to supplier diversity, to our commitment, to an inclusive culture, we're incredibly proud of these achievements. But we know we have got much more work to do. In all these categories, we\u2019re never finished. I personally want to thank our employees. They are so engaged in every aspect of ESG, it matters to them. Like our investors who expect us to live up to ESG principles, so do our employees. In conclusion, here is what you can expect from us. Our fundamental investment strategy remains, we're affirming our long-term EPS CAGR of 7% to 10%. We plan to invest about $10.4 billion in the next five years, an increase of $1.3 billion over last year's plan, we expect an increase of potential regulated acquisitions, now in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% EPS CAGR, we plan for dividend growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% growth range, and we'll continue to champion or high-performing culture, focused on safety and inclusion and diversity. We're confident in our ability to continue as a top leader in the utility sector. And we hope today's presentation has provided you with a transparent strategic path to our long-term success. Before we take your questions, I'd offer you this thought, financially successful companies are frequently recognized nationally and internationally for strong performance and that's important. But for us, success is about enabling our employees to perform at their best. It\u2019s about leading a team of extraordinary people doing critical work. It's about investing in people, communities, and helping our country solve its water and wastewater challenges. We're excited about our future and we thank you for being on this journey with us. Before we take a quick break, I would like to turn it back to Ed Vallejo for information about participating in our question-and-answer session.\nEd Vallejo: Thank you, Walter. At this time for members of the investment community that wish to ask a question, please dial in using the instructions we provided in a previous e-mail. We\u2019ll now take a five minute break.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to American Water's 2021 virtual Investor Day. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And today's first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. Susan, so my first question is about equity needs. You guys do not have an ATM plan, so talk to me please about how you see that $700 million in equity exactly \u2013 roughly which years and again, would you consider an ATM?\nSusan Hardwick: Hey, good morning, Angie. Thanks for the question. Yes, so little bit of an update to this year's plan on the equity requirements as I indicated it\u2019s about $700 million, we were at $500. And recall in our last plan, we had talked about that $500 million being sort of in the middle of the five year so roughly in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. I would say that's generally where we have this $700 million still scheduled, and my philosophy on this is we sort of line up the need or the issue with the need and the capital plan. So that's when it sort of comes into the plan in terms of expected requirements. We haven't really decided, and I know I keep saying this, but we haven't really decided on methodology yet, whether we do sort of a block issue or we do it using some other tool, we certainly are considering an ATM like program and you're right, we don't have one in place today, it may fit the profile a little better to use a program like that. We just haven't made any decisions on it, I would just tell you again, sort of generally speaking, it's in the middle of the five years and we'll continue to look at best method to get it to market.\nAngie Storozynski: Good. And the second question, so you increased the growth contributions \u2013 earnings growth contributions coming from regulated utility acquisitions. And forgive me if you guys have addressed that already. But is it assumption of acquisitions that have already been secured? Or is it just that the pipeline backlog of deals has improved to such an extent that even the larger base, you feel like the pace of growth associated with this portion of your business is going to accelerate?\nWalter Lynch: Angie, Walter here, how are you? I'm going to take that question. So let me start by just apologizing for the issues with the webcast, if you missed any of the 30 to 60 seconds, let me tell you in my section, it was fabulous. So I would ask you to go back and look at it again. So the 1.5% to 2.5%, that's a reflection of the growing pipeline that we have, Bill Varley working with the State teams have been hard at it to truly identify opportunities and then work them through our pipeline. And right now, we believe that we're confident that the pipeline supports that increase up to 1.5% to 2.5%, so that's really the reason for the growing part of that growth triangle.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And lastly, any more color on what's going on in New York? I mean, you haven't really changed your expectations as to when the transaction should close. Also it seems like the financing plan includes proceeds from this asset sales, so if he could just comment on that.\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Let me start with what's going on there and then Susan can talk about that. Yes, we still \u2013 we're working structurally with the public service commission as we work towards the sale of the system there. We still believe it's in the best interest of New York American Water customers to sell the Liberty. As you know on February 3, the governor directed a special council to complete a study on the feasibility of a public takeover, and that study is to be completed by April 1. So while we remain confident in the sale the date of that work and the outcome of that work may impact our timing to some degree.\nSusan Hardwick: And Angie on the proceed side, I'd just add quickly here. We have increased the expectation for proceeds, sort of after tax proceeds from the sale compared to our prior plan. We increased it about $250 million and obviously that's a source of equity if you will in this plan to help finance the growth here. And that really is just driven by \u2013 as we continue to kind of refine our estimates around tax position on the transaction, we feel like there is more proceeds coming after tax. So we did an increase at about $250 million from the prior plan.\nAngie Storozynski: And the last question I promise, New Jersey still hasn't ruled on the acquisition adjustments, right, I mean, it doesn't seem like [indiscernible] posted on the website.\nWalter Lynch: Yes, Angie, they have not ruled on it yet.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, Walter and I promise to go back and listen to the 30 to 60 seconds.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Just going back to \u2013 just the 1.5% to 2.5%, I just want to sort of understand that a little bit better. So, obviously that's sort of a large increase versus the base, right, a 1% base \u2013 that 1% to 2% base that you were targeting earlier. What gives you confidence? I mean, I know sort of Bill is in charge of that team and he has a proven track record of completing successful acquisitions. But, is there something that you're seeing in the pipeline here today, or recently that gives you confidence in the higher growth rate there.\nWalter Lynch: Yes, thanks Durgesh. Well, as you know we increased our pipeline and almost doubled it over the last year and it's really focusing in the States where we want to grow and focusing on both water and wastewater. We're still pursuing wastewater opportunities in areas where we serve water customers and also adjacent to where we serve water customers. And I think if you look at the city of New York wastewater, that's a perfect example of that. But it's really a combination of the States doing a tremendous job in identifying opportunities and working them through the pipeline. But also the team here led by Bill, working with the States to look at best practices and things that we can take advantage of across our scale of our business. So that's why really the increase is there, but it's really back to the pipeline, it's all about a pipeline, you have to have a pipeline to deliver on those acquisitions. Bill, if there is anything you want to add.\nBill Varley: Yes. Hi, Durgesh, how are you doing?\nDurgesh Chopra: Good Bill. Thanks.\nBill Varley: In part of the pipeline development, it's a discipline approach to evaluation Durgesh, and we're not just looking for financial conditions, we take a look at the water quality, looking at wastewater compliance and what are the community needs are too. So we're looking at solutions and it's a systematic process that we go through. And to the aspect of increasing the pipeline on the wastewater side, 93% of our business is the water side. But I think now the realization is that they actually \u2013 if communities is sitting on an asset that has value, which they didn't realize before by our proactive approach, and also the view is potential liability. So, you combine all the factors with a discipline approach, increasing the pipeline, I think that's what gives us our confidence\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. That's super helpful. And then maybe just Walter your thoughts on the market-based business, so that long-term growth rate has come down, can you just talk through that? Is that sort of intentional, or are you seeing less opportunities there going forward?\nWalter Lynch: We moved it from 1% to 2% to 1%, and it's really a reflection of the regulated business growing at a faster clip and particularly the regulated acquisitions that we identified. So that's really what's driving that, we're still very confident in our market-based businesses, both in the military and homeowner services. In the military, as you know, we won the last three awards where there are five outstanding, we expect two to be awarded in the near-term and we're confident in our ability to continue to provide great service for the men and women in the military. So we're confident in both businesses and they contribute to the success of our organization. So the very complimentary to what we do and they provide free cash flow and we're able to extend our core competencies, particularly on the military side and provide a great service for the 17 installations.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. So essentially it's focusing more on the regulator side of the business. You have a higher regulated acquisitions growth now. And so, the end result of that is a lower market based business growth. Okay. Understood.\nWalter Lynch: Exactly.\nDurgesh Chopra: And then just one quick clarification, Susan, the 2021 EPS guidance range that does not include New York American, am I correct about that?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, obviously we haven't filled it yet, as we plan to sell it sometime in 2021. So there'll be some results in 2021 related to it. We've not specifically identified it as an adjustment to or any sort of the impact to 2021\u2019s guidance. So I would just say 2021\u2019s guidance is what it is and it contemplates the sale of New York American Water sometime during the year.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Thanks guys, much appreciate the time.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Durgesh.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Insoo Kim from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Hi, can you guys hear me?\nWalter Lynch: We can.\nSusan Hardwick: We can Insoo.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank you. Maybe starting off in Texas, I don't know if you mentioned this earlier, I'm sorry if I missed it. But I know you have a couple of the military bases down there, could you just describe a little bit about the experience you had with these winter storms and maybe related to that, currently you're not in your regular utilities, you're not in Texas, but given the water infrastructure issues that played out in that State, how do you see that State of a potential opportunity for expansion?\nWalter Lynch: Yes, thanks Insoo. And you\u2019re right, we don't have regulated operations in Texas. We do have two military bases where we provide water and wastewater service Joint Base San Antonio and then Fort Hood. And I've got to say, I'm so proud of our teams and the work they've done around the clock to continue to provide service. And while we experienced many more main breaks and other challenges within the systems, our folks kept the water running for our military folks on those bases, so we're really, really proud of them. As far as the Texas operations, I mean, there is a little bit different design and construction down in Texas because they're not really designed to withstand extended periods of cold weather, and that's been the challenge down there. And so when a storm like that hits, it really challenges the system from a number of perspectives. The pipes are not buried very deep. Many of them are above ground and they tend to freeze at a much quicker pace. And a lot of the homes are not insulated like they are in the Northeast. So that's really what contributed to a lot of the issues down there. Our systems are resilient. We spend a lot of money, as Cheryl said, 8% of our capital spend is spent on resiliency in our systems to make sure that our systems can withstand extended periods of cold weather. And we do a great job at it. And while we have at times many more main breaks, our teams are out repairing those main breaks and restoring service in the shortest amount of time. So I'm really proud again, of our operations in Texas as two military bases. And again, our systems are designed and constructed to withstand extended periods of cold weather.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. I guess, from that expansion opportunity, do you think that this could be an interesting opportunity as you look towards increasing your municipal growth rate?\nWalter Lynch: We continually assess where we want to operate and for us \u2013 we've said many times for us to enter a state, we've got to have a good regulatory environment, a good business environment, and the ability to grow to at least 50,000 customers roughly over a five-year period. So we'll continue to assess entry points in the different states using that methodology. But we're again really proud of our efforts down there and we've responded and helped the communities down there by shipping a bottle of water. We're really proud of that as well, because that's who we are as a company coming to the aid of people in this country, even though they're not our customers.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. And then just one more, if I could, given Biden Administration focused on infrastructure spend and on the water side and water quality as well, how much of that do you think you've embedded in your five to 10 year plan and any sense initially, what type of upside opportunities exist?\nWalter Lynch: Yes, I think we believe there's going to be an infrastructure bill. We don't believe there's going to be any free money going out to the municipalities. We think there'll be access to low interest loans for the state revolving funds, and we're working to get access to that. On the wastewater side, we do get access on the water side, but we're working to get access on the wastewater side. So we can \u2013 our customers can benefit like the other customers through a low interest loans. But our five-year plan is an increase of 1.3 billion over the last plan from last year. And we're going to continue to invest in the areas that we need to invest in and make sure our systems are resilient.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Thank you so much.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Today's next question comes from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRyan Greenwald: Good morning, everyone. Appreciate the time.\nWalter Lynch: Good morning.\nRyan Greenwald: So on the rebasing to the weather adjusted 2020. It implies slightly lower earnings relative to the 2018 base. Is this predominantly driven by the additional equity or is there any other considerations there?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, Ryan, we certainly don't view this as rebasing at all. I mean, we're simply growing off of 2020 actual results. And we had that available to us at the timing of our release for 2021 guidance. So growth of 2020, as we've talked about is very strong continues to focus on that long-term growth rate of 7% to 10% over the five years. So that is our focus and that's our continued reiteration of long-term guidance. There is more equity in the plan, obviously with a couple of hundred million more. So there was some dilution obviously built in the plan last year, and then just incrementally more dilution as a result of additional equity.\nRyan Greenwald: Got it. Fair enough. And then as you guys continue to assess your focal points and you work through the sale of New York this year, any other states right now that you're considering maybe divesting operations for use of \u2013 to get some proceeds, to finance all the regulated acquisition opportunities.\nWalter Lynch: Yes, thanks for that, Ryan we continually assess where we want to operate and where we can provide the best customer service, most efficient operations and continue to grow. And we'll just continue to do that. We're not in any position now to say that.\nRyan Greenwald: Got it. Thanks for the time.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Ryan.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Verity Mitchell with HSBC London, please go ahead.\nVerity Mitchell: Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for the presentation. Really helpful, I've got a question on efficiency. Actually I noticed on Slide 26, you've only say 4.3% since 2015. So 15% is quite an ambitious target and scare me that consumers actually use less water, or what happens if they actually use more water than that time? Are you really confident that you can deliver that?\nCheryl Norton: Thank you for the question. And yes, we're very confident that we can deliver that. We think it's a lot more than our customers actually using less water. We think it's water efficiency across the board. So for example, by improving our leak detection efforts out in our distribution system, we will be able to recover more of that non-revenue water or that unaccounted for water within our systems. And so we're looking at it from a holistic perspective. We do continue to pick up a decline in usage in the residential space based on fixtures and appliances, but we really think this is going to be driven more by the capital improvements that we make so that we can reduce the amount of leakage and water loss that we have in the system.\nVerity Mitchell: Are you going to give us an update on an annual basis or is it going to be much more of a long-term target? How do we track or how you're managing?\nCheryl Norton: Yes, it is a long-term target, but we do plan to provide annual updates on where we're at with it. And we probably in future calls may talk about some of the technology we're using just to help you have a clearer picture around our path to get there.\nVerity Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nWalter Lynch: Yes. And it's really about the targeted investment that Cheryl said in replacing pipe that's old and worn out and maybe more prone to main breaks and also leveraging technology to identify leaks there. Those are two key areas for us to continue to improve in that area, Verity.\nVerity Mitchell: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Reeder: Hey, Walter and team most of mine have been asked and answered but I will just throw one more out there. Just kind of curious what cause the pushback in PaPUC\u2019s final decision and your pending rate case, given the ALJ recommendation supporting the settlement.\nWalter Lynch: Susan, you want to take that or I can jump in?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, either one. I guess, maybe we could just start with a bit of news. We did just get word here that the commission just did approve the settlement agreement. So we actually have an order now in Pennsylvania just issued moments ago. And they did approve the settlement as it was submitted.\nWalter Lynch: Any other question, Jonathan, it\u2019s timely.\nJonathan Reeder: Yes, yes, great presentation and appreciate the update.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Jonathan.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Jonathan\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.\nBecca Followill: Good morning, guys. The Biden Administration is reviewing a host of different environmental regulations. Is there anything in the works on the water side that might provide more stringent regulations for munis, et cetera, that might help facilitate further M&A for you guys?\nWalter Lynch: Yes, thanks for the question, Becca. I think one of the areas and it's been out there for some time is really the PFAS limits. And again, there's a health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion. Many states have enacted more stringent standards, but I think the EPA maybe monitored or coming up with a limit on that would be one area of focus for the Biden Administration. I know it's going to take some time and the EPA likes to focus on science to make their MCLs, but I think that's going to be a key area as they establish that, they'll continue to look at other emerging contaminants. And that will play again into our acquisition strategy as we continue to provide solutions for communities. And we think there is going to be a keen focus here by the EPA. Cheryl, is there anything you want to add to that?\nCheryl Norton: I think that covers it, Walter. I fully anticipate that we're going to see the regulatory environment ramp up.\nBecca Followill: Thank you. And then the second question on from a state basis, is there any type of emerging legislation that would also help facilitate M&A, something that's in the works that has not yet been passed that looks like it's going to be introduced?\nWalter Lynch: Well, let me start with Water Quality Accountability Act that started in New Jersey that two other states have adopted. I think that is being considered in other states within our footprint. So I would look out for that primarily in the Midwest and that again, establishes standards that are uniform across the sector, whether a municipally-owned or investor-owned, around cybersecurity, some of the challenges there, around pipe replacement rates, about long-term asset management plans. And that's been instrumental in many of the discussions we've had in the states where we operate that have that legislation. So I think it's a wake up call for many municipalities to say, maybe we should talk to American Water about selling assistance.\nBecca Followill: Great. Thank you.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Walter Lynch for any closing remarks.\nWalter Lynch: Okay. Thanks Racco. First, let me say thanks for joining us today, and we value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and the investment in our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team and they'll be happy to answer them. Thanks again for joining us and please stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you, sir. Today's conference has now concluded. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thank you, Cheryl. Good morning, it's good to be with you virtually this morning. And we certainly look forward to doing this in person, hopefully very soon. I'm Susan Hardwick, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of American Water. You have just heard from my colleagues, the various elements of our strategy. Let me now translate what that means to our financial plan. But before we get into our longer-term financial outlook, let me take you through the highlights of our strong 2020 results. In the fourth quarter of 2020, earnings were $0.80 per share, compared to $0.54 per share in the same period of 2019, an increase of $0.26 per share. Results for the regulated business increased $0.01 per share and results from the market-based business increased $0.22 per share. Parent company results improved $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. Consolidated results reflect a two set per share benefit from depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting in 2020 related to the pending New York sale, and the loss of $0.19 per share on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2019. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 earnings were $3.91 per share compared to $3.43 cents per share in the same period of 2019, an increase of $0.48 per share. Earnings in the regulated business increased $0.33 per share, while the market-based business results improved $0.24 per share compared to 2019. Parent company results were $0.09 per share lower in 2020 as compared to 2019, due primarily to higher interest expense. Regulated results reflect an estimated $0.10 per share, favorable impact year-over-year due to warmer and drier than normal weather across several of the company's subsidiaries in 2020 and unusually wet weather conditions in 2019. Regulated results also include the impact of increased revenues from new rates in effect, as well as earnings from acquisitions offset somewhat by higher wages and related costs and other maintenance costs. Operation and maintenance costs and depreciation also increased in support of growth in the business. And finally, regulated results reflect $0.06 per share benefit from depreciation not recorded as required by the assets held for sale accounting in 2020. Market-based business results improved compared to 2019 from the addition of installations for the Military Group and new partnerships and price increases in the Homeowner Services Group. As a reminder, results in 2019 reflect a $0.19 per share loss on the disposal of Keystone Clearwater Solutions in the fourth quarter of 2019. Additionally, results for the full year 2020 included an estimated $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the homeowner services group from increased claims that likely have resulted from more work from home activity. For the regulated business, as we have mentioned throughout much of 2020, we have been working with regulators to secure the opportunity to defer for future recovery, many of the impacts of the pandemic. And we did see as expected that an increase in residential demand largely offset the lower demand in the commercial sector. Our solid performance in 2020 is the basis for our long-term outlook. And as Walter highlighted for you, that outlook is quite strong. Referring to Slide 31, we are establishing the EPS guidance for 2021 of $4.18 to $4.28 per share, compared to our weather normalized results of $3.84 per share for 2020. Our expectation for 2020 run reflects a year-over-year growth rate of over 10%, which is what we indicated would occur at our Analyst Day last year. In longer-term, we are maintaining our growth outlook of 7% to 10% over the next five years anchored off of 2020 results. The foundation of our growth as both Bill and Walter mentioned is our investment in rate base through acquisition and upgrades to our existing systems. As you've heard today, we are stepping up our expected investment in both of these areas. And I think the important thing here is to continue to emphasize that there are multiple decades of capital investment opportunity in the regulated business. I should also add that the market-based businesses do not require a lot of capital, but do incrementally add to our earnings growth expectation, as we have continued to show on our growth triangle. As you can see now though, that expected contribution is slightly lower at about 1% as the expected growth through acquisitions has grown to a larger slice of the triangle. As shown on Slide 33, for 2021, we expect to invest $1.9 billion in our regulated operations. You can see the breakdown between the investment in the existing system, which feeds the bottom part of our growth triangle and the expected regulated acquisition spend, which feeds the mid part of our growth triangle. Over the next five years, we expect to spend between $10.3 billion and $10.5 billion, a $1.3 billion increase in capital investment compared to last year's five year plan. Of that increased amount, the split is roughly even between acquisitions and infrastructure investment in our existing systems. And our expected 10 year capital investment plan now stands at the $22 billion to $25 billion range, an increase of $2 billion to $3 billion from last year's 10 year outlook. Our rate-based growth expectation remains a very strong 7% to 8%. In absolute terms you can see on Slide 34, that we have grown rate-base by 50% since 2010 to an estimated $15 billion at the end of 2020. Let's transition to how we intend to finance operations and the capital plan that we have just announced over the next five years, turning to Slide 35. As expected we will rely primarily on our operating cash flows to finance the business. We expect operating cash flows to be roughly $8.5 billion over the next five years, we're planning to raise a total of $3.6 billion of long-term debt, net of maturity repayments over the next five years, coupled with about $700 million of equity needs, which is up slightly from the $500 million we discussed as part of last year's plan. That combined with the proceeds from our New York American sale of roughly $500 million will finance this five year plan. If you are thinking back to the same discussion last year, this current plan represents an increased investment of about $1.3 billion as we've said. That increment will be financed with increased cash flow from operations, as we roll the plan forward a year, additional expected cash proceeds from the New York sale as we have refined our estimated tax obligation upon the sale and additional public equity and debt financing. The incremental need will be financed with about 54% equity sources and 46% debt, which is supportive of our focus on the balance sheet strength and our overall debt to total capital goal. As I mentioned, a key source of financing is cash flow from operations. As a regulated business, it is important that we timely earn and collect a return on the investment. To that end, we continue to be very active on the regulatory front. Recall our discussion with you last year that several of our larger States were expected to be conducting general rate cases throughout much of 2020. As those and other proceedings have progressed, the regulated businesses have received $151 million of annualized new revenue since the start of 2020. And this includes $56 million from rate cases and $95 million from infrastructure surcharges. We are awaiting final orders on four rate cases and two infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $208 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver results. Let me take a minute to provide an update on the developments in the rate case proceeding of Pennsylvania American. As was mentioned on the third quarter earnings call in October of 2020 Pennsylvania, American Water and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission Bureau of Investigation and Enforcement entered into a settlement agreement, providing for a total annualized revenue increase of $71 million over a two year period. In November 2020, the company's Pennsylvania subsidiary and the remaining active parties in the case presented their positions and briefs to the administrative law judge, who issued to the Pennsylvania public utility commission a recommended decision approving the settlement. The procedural schedule in this case was extended to March 15, 2021. The company expects the Pennsylvania PUC to issue a final order by the end of the first quarter, and once approved by the PUC, the new rates will be retroactive to January 28, 2021. Now turning back to the big picture on Slide 37. As we execute on this plan over the next five years, it is very important for us to maintain a healthy balance sheet. As you know, we have maintained an A credit rating at S&P and a Baa1 at Moody's. We believe this plan, both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it, is supportive of those current credit ratings. We are proud of our strong credit profile and we continue to work hard and maintaining it for the benefit ultimately of our customers. The upper right of Slide 37 is our debt to total capital metric. You can see that this new plan will position us at approximately a 59% to 60% debt to total cap ratio, where we indicated last year, we would be \u2013 and notably down from the 62% at the end of 2020. The bottom left of the slide shows our debt maturity profile for the next five years. This is a very manageable refinancing profile, which we worked very hard to achieve. We have had very favorable debt capital market transactions over the past several years that have allowed us to effectively build this financing structure. Also on this slide, you can see a glimpse at our liquidity, both now and what we expect at the terminal year of this five year plan. Our current cash balance of $547 million includes the proceeds of the $500 million term loan we entered into in March, 2020 to ensure adequate funds to meet our liquidity needs amid the disruption of short-term commercial paper markets at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. The term loan comes due in March of this year. Even without the term loan our $2.25 billion line of credit affords us plenty of capacity to the extent we need it. And finally, on Slide 38, let me just reiterate the compelling story of American Water. We remain confident that we can grow earnings in the 7% to 10% range over the next five year period. American Water remains one of the fastest growing utilities in the entire utility sector. We have also delivered top quartile utility dividend growth while maintaining a payout ratio target of 50% to 60% and remain committed to continuing that as we expect to grow our dividend at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We commit to maintaining our predominantly regulated risk profile with the regulated businesses providing 89% of our 2025 projected EPS. The foundation of this business is regulated operations, and we currently expect to invest between $22 billion and $25 billion over the next decade on water quality and the safety and security of our water infrastructure. The combination of our EPS and dividend growth continues to be a top performer in the utility sector on total shareholder return. As you can see on the right side of this slide, we have delivered an annualized total shareholder return of 182% over the past five years. This is a business that is fundamentally very strong and we continue to deliver excellent outcomes to all of our stakeholders. We are very proud to be able to do that. And with that, I'll turn the call back over to Walter for some closing remarks. Hey, good morning, Angie. Thanks for the question. Yes, so little bit of an update to this year's plan on the equity requirements as I indicated it's about $700 million, we were at $500. And recall in our last plan, we had talked about that $500 million being sort of in the middle of the five year so roughly in the 2022, 2023 timeframe. I would say that's generally where we have this $700 million still scheduled, and my philosophy on this is we sort of line up the need or the issue with the need and the capital plan. So that's when it sort of comes into the plan in terms of expected requirements. We haven't really decided, and I know I keep saying this, but we haven't really decided on methodology yet, whether we do sort of a block issue or we do it using some other tool, we certainly are considering an ATM like program and you're right, we don't have one in place today, it may fit the profile a little better to use a program like that. We just haven't made any decisions on it, I would just tell you again, sort of generally speaking, it's in the middle of the five years and we'll continue to look at best method to get it to market. And Angie on the proceed side, I'd just add quickly here. We have increased the expectation for proceeds, sort of after tax proceeds from the sale compared to our prior plan. We increased it about $250 million and obviously that's a source of equity if you will in this plan to help finance the growth here. And that really is just driven by \u2013 as we continue to kind of refine our estimates around tax position on the transaction, we feel like there is more proceeds coming after tax. So we did an increase at about $250 million from the prior plan. Well, obviously we haven't filled it yet, as we plan to sell it sometime in 2021. So there'll be some results in 2021 related to it. We've not specifically identified it as an adjustment to or any sort of the impact to 2021's guidance. So I would just say 2021's guidance is what it is and it contemplates the sale of New York American Water sometime during the year. Thanks Durgesh. We can Insoo. Well, Ryan, we certainly don't view this as rebasing at all. I mean, we're simply growing off of 2020 actual results. And we had that available to us at the timing of our release for 2021 guidance. So growth of 2020, as we've talked about is very strong continues to focus on that long-term growth rate of 7% to 10% over the five years. So that is our focus and that's our continued reiteration of long-term guidance. There is more equity in the plan, obviously with a couple of hundred million more. So there was some dilution obviously built in the plan last year, and then just incrementally more dilution as a result of additional equity. Thanks Ryan. Well, either one. I guess, maybe we could just start with a bit of news. We did just get word here that the commission just did approve the settlement agreement. So we actually have an order now in Pennsylvania just issued moments ago. And they did approve the settlement as it was submitted. Thanks Jonathan."

            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thank you, Bill; and good morning, everyone. I'm Cheryl Norton, Chief Environmental Officer of American Water and President of New Jersey American Water. As Walter said earlier, I'm a great example of the value that American Water places on the development of its employees. My career began at American Water 34 years ago, when I was hired as a temporary employee at our central lab in Belleville, Illinois. And on March 1, I will become the Chief Operating Officer. The path that I've taken to get here today has given me a broad base of experience across multiple states and multiple areas of the business. My start with American Water as a microbiology research technician gave me a unique perspective on water quality, which I continued to build on throughout the years. It's been fun to reconnect with those roots in the Chief Environmental Officer role. I've worked in Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri and New Jersey, and I even spent a few months in West Virginia. My leadership roles in these States allowed me to become familiar with operational challenges across the business. I've also experienced a wide range of regulatory and legislative environments and can directly relate to the efforts that Walter and Bill mentioned, and the importance to the business and our customers. My success is a direct result of the amazing people that I've worked with over the years, who've been willing to teach me the business and allow me to bring my whole self to work. I'm honored and grateful to have the opportunity to give back by mentoring and helping others find their path here at American Water. In the future, I'll be here to talk to you about the industry leading operations across American Water, but today, I'm excited to talk to you about our ESG efforts. At American Water, ESG is core to our business and integral to our success. It's who we are, what we do and how we do it. Living by ESG principles is our commitment to operate in the most responsible manner possible. ESG is a constantly evolving journey for us. The information that we gather for various reports is used internally to guide our strategy, as well as externally for investors. We categorize our reporting topics into five key areas, which includes stakeholder engagement, workforce, customers, infrastructure and environmental stewardship. We confirm those topics with various internal and external stakeholders. We know that each stakeholder group brings a valuable perspective that helps inform our priorities. ESG is not simply environmental, social or governance, it's the sum of all three areas coming together and overlapping with our corporate values and strategy. The culture at American Water is what makes us who we are and our employees throughout our business understand that how we do things matters just as much as what we do. Let's talk about some of the data that represents the social pillar and the progress that we've been making. Our focus on inclusion and diversity continues at American Water with improvements in areas such as talent attraction, retention and development. During 2020, 84% of job requisitions had a diverse candidate pool with approximately 59% of transfers and/or promotions filled by minority, female, veteran or disabled individuals. In 2020, we named a Chief Inclusion Officer and a Director of Inclusion and Diversity. These roles will work with leaders all across our business to help ensure our progress continues. We are also very proud of our nationally recognized supplier diversity program. In 2021, our goal is to achieve a diverse supplier and small business spend of 27.6%, an increase of approximately 10% over 2020 results. We recognized the importance of these efforts to our company and the communities we serve. Regarding safety, if we don't get safety, right, nothing else matters. We have a long-term target of zero injuries and our employees work tirelessly to keep each other safe. Our 2020 safety performance was the best in the company's recorded history, despite this great improvement that performance represents 63 injuries and that's 63, too many. Our focus on safety has driven a 67% reduction in workplace injuries over the past five years, which is 81% better than the industry average. But being an industry leader isn't good enough, and so we get to zero injuries, we still have work to do, and our focus will continue. We understand the importance of developing our teams and we've increased our target for annual training for all employees from 20 hours to 25 hours for 2021. During 2020, our employees completed more than 100,000 hours of safety training, in addition to other important training. This is a significant statistic considering that due to COVID-19 almost all of that training was done virtually. Turning to our environmental goals. After completing a thorough goal benchmarking process, we identified three opportunities to build on our previous work. We're excited to share with you a measurement clarification to our existing energy and emissions goal, and two new goals regarding water efficiency and water resiliency. We're clarifying our existing energy and emissions goal to include specifics around measurement. The goal has been adjusted to reduce absolute scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions by more than 40% by 2025 from our 2007 baseline. As a reminder, the vast majority of energy consumed by water utilities is used to pump water. In fact, roughly 4% of all the electricity in the U.S. is used for the treatment and transport of water, around 90% of our total electricity consumption and over 80% of our greenhouse gas emissions are related to the pumping of water. Our path to reduce energy consumption and emissions is driven by using water more efficiently. Through year end 2019, we had reduced greenhouse gas emissions by over 32%, which puts us at 80% of our 2025 goal. By continuing to improve energy and water efficiency, increasing procurement of renewable energy and modifying our fleet, we're on track to meet this target by 2025. Our two new long-term goals are focused on water efficiency and resiliency. By 2035, we will reduce the amount of water delivered per customer by 15% compared to a 2015 baseline. And by 2030, we will improve our water system resiliency by increasing our utility resilience index or URI weighted average by 10% from a 2020 baseline. These goals are the right thing to do for the communities we serve and they will enhance our leadership position in ESG. Let me talk about our two new goals in more detail. As a water company, we have a responsibility to our customers and the environment to be as efficient as possible. That's why we're committed to meeting our customer's water needs, while simultaneously saving 15% in water delivered per customer compared to a 2015 baseline. Over the past five years, we've already accomplished a 4.3% reduction in water delivered per customer, and in the future, we'll expand best practices from our existing conservation programs, utilize innovative technologies like AMI and leak detection and leverage the transparency that we gained through these programs to identify and eliminate sources of water loss faster. By investing capital to improve system performance, we can reduce water loss and non-revenue water, while minimizing customer rate impacts. In addition, we'll continue to benefit from the ongoing national trends of declining residential water use related to fixtures and appliances. Our third environmental goal is to increase our water system resiliency to prepare for and respond to more extreme events. We'll do that by improving the weighted average of our utility resilience index or URI from our 2020 baseline. Our target is a 10% improvement by 2030. Recent history shows that the frequency and severity of weather events, as well as the stress on water supplies related to scarcity, flooding and contamination events, makes the resiliency of our systems more important than ever. We spend approximately 8% of our total capital investment on resiliency projects each year to address these risks and maintain continuous service to our customers. Another key factor in resiliency is the preparedness of our employees. We continue to strengthen our workforce through incident management training and emergency preparedness. We often go beyond our workforce and include contractors and community partners in our emergency response planning and drills. This approach not only makes our response plans stronger, it builds trust and valuable relationships with the communities we serve. Let's take a minute to look at what the URI is in a bit more detail. It's a part of the American Water Works associations, risk and resilience management of water and wastewater standard, also known as the J-100 standard. It's made up of three categories, our people, our assets and the communities we serve. It calculates a utility's ability to respond to and recover from extreme events, including severe weather, environmental incidents, cyber attacks, supply chain disruptions and more. A higher average index percentage indicates that we're able to return to normal operations more quickly, there will always be some element of risk, so this assessment doesn't offer the potential for a perfect score. Best-in-class scores range from 60% to 70%. Our 2020 baseline of approximately 66% weighted average across our footprint is well within that range. Our goal to improve by 10% will further help us be prepared for whatever extreme event may arise. To be frank, measuring our performance in this way sets us apart from others in the sector, to our knowledge, we are the only company holding ourselves to this high standard. In closing American Water is a proven leader in ESG and our new long-term goals are designed to solidify our leadership role. We will continue to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, improve water efficiency and ensure that our systems are leading the industry in resiliency. It is what we do. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Susan. Thank you for the question. And yes, we're very confident that we can deliver that. We think it's a lot more than our customers actually using less water. We think it's water efficiency across the board. So for example, by improving our leak detection efforts out in our distribution system, we will be able to recover more of that non-revenue water or that unaccounted for water within our systems. And so we're looking at it from a holistic perspective. We do continue to pick up a decline in usage in the residential space based on fixtures and appliances, but we really think this is going to be driven more by the capital improvements that we make so that we can reduce the amount of leakage and water loss that we have in the system. Yes, it is a long-term target, but we do plan to provide annual updates on where we're at with it. And we probably in future calls may talk about some of the technology we're using just to help you have a clearer picture around our path to get there. I think that covers it, Walter. I fully anticipate that we're going to see the regulatory environment ramp up."

            "content": "Thanks Ed and good morning, everyone. I'm Walter Lynch, President and CEO of American Water. I want to welcome and thank you for taking the time to join us today. We know you have a choice in where to invest your money. We thank you for your confidence in American Water. We're confident that throughout our presentation today, you'll continue to see that we're positioned for success for decades to come. And we continue to have a compelling long-term value profile for you, our owners. We look forward to sharing our story. Before we discuss our agenda today and move to the presentation. I want to echo Ed's message on safety. Nothing matters more to everyone at American Water than the safety of our team and the public. As a company that provides essential services to communities across the country and an employer of more than 7,000 people with families and loved ones, no injury is ever acceptable to us. Safety is embedded in everything we do and is that the foundation, the plane will lay out for you today. Turning to our next slide. As outlined in our press release issued yesterday, American Water continues to execute on our strategies and we're well positioned for long-term success. Today, I'll start by discussing our strategic focus and our commitment to building and maintaining reliable and resilient water and wastewater infrastructure, cultivating an inclusive high performing culture, delivering water and wastewater solutions, where we create value for customers and communities and continuing our commitment to being a values-led company. Bill Varley, our Chief Growth Officer will discuss our regulated growth strategy. Cheryl Norton, our Chief Environmental Officer and President of New Jersey American Water will talk about our commitment to ESG principles and our new, and we think critical environmental targets. And Susan Hardwick, our Chief Financial Officer will cover in more detail, our 2021 guidance and long-term business plan along with our strong 2020 results. We'll then look forward to answering your questions. Everything we'll discuss today starts with a clear, transparent strategy. We've been providing essential water and wastewater services dating back to 1886. Our success is rooted in our values of safety, trust, environmental leadership, teamwork, and high-performance, and the strategies we built around our safety, people, operational excellence, growth and customers. As we look to the future and our long-term success. Today, I want to spend some time and how we'll continue to create value for all our stakeholders. This starts with operating where we can leverage our strengths, including areas where we have customer concentrations. Fragmentation has long been a challenge for water and wastewater providers across the United States. But for American Water, we're able to focus our resources and efforts where we have scale, where we can drive efficiencies, invest in reliable and resilient infrastructure while enhancing our customer's experience and keeping their bills affordable. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of clean, safe, reliable water, and wastewater services like never before, by strategically focusing our resources, we strengthen our operations and continue to provide excellent local customer service. This strategic effort also provides greater opportunities to deliver meaningful water and wastewater solutions to communities building on our proven success. Last year, we invested more capital than any previous year. We continued our disciplined focus in O&M efficiencies. We added approximately 38,000 customer connections through acquisitions in 10 states. And we were recently named one of the Top 10 World's Most Sustainable Corporations by Corporate Knights. Now we'll build upon that success by continuing to hone our strengths. There's no other water and wastewater service provider with our scaling capabilities. We're uniquely positioned to help our country address long existing water and wastewater challenges and strengthen the communities that we're privileged to serve. And that starts with the dedicated and talented people of American Water. This goes beyond investing in training. It's an intentional long-term commitment to building and hiring talent, inspiring and rewarding high-performance, creating fulsome development paths and building a strong, diverse team. A perfect example of our bench strength is last week's news that Cheryl Norton has been named American Water's Chief Operating Officer, effective March 1. We're so pleased to have Cheryl take on this key leadership role for our company. Cheryl has deep utility experience, a strong commitment to safety, a passion for excellent customer care and a collaborative approach to building high performing teams. Importantly, she fully embraces our values and the culture we continue to build at American Water. We're cultivating deeply committed and passionate teams that care about our customers, our communities, and each other. Let me take a moment to talk about our business and the continued execution of our strategies. American Water is the largest and most geographically diverse water and wastewater utility in the United States. We have more than 7,000 employees who provide drinking water, wastewater, and other related services to an estimated 15 million people in 46 states. We provide services to customers through our two business segments, our regulated business, and our market-based businesses. Our regulated business is our core business, providing more than 89% of our projected EPS by 2025. We own and operate a significant amount of assets, including more than 53,000 miles of pipes, 609 water treatment plants, 150 wastewater treatment plants, 1,100 wells and 75 dams. We treat and deliver more than 1 billion gallons of water every day for our customers. Our market based businesses include homeowner services and our military services group, which I'll speak to in a moment. Before we move on to the next slide let me comment on recent transactions that illustrate the execution of our strategy. As you know, we're in the process of selling our operations in New York, and we recently signed an agreement to sell our Michigan operation. We're working on additional opportunities that will further strengthen our presence in states where we're eager to grow. We expect to have more to share on that in the very near future. These agreements and other opportunities that we're exploring are a key part of our strategy to operate in states where we can best serve customers, drive efficiencies and continue to grow through regulated investment and acquisitions. I would also note that Pennsylvania-American Water was the successful bidder to acquire the wastewater treatment and collection system for the city of York, Pennsylvania. We're currently working through the approval process. This potential agreement would add an equivalent customer connection total of about 45,000 and would be another example of growing where we can add value. Let's turn to our long-term growth story on Slide 9, covering our five-year plan. You'll recognize our projected growth triangle, now reflecting a larger growth expectation from regulated acquisitions. This plan also reflects our increasing capital plan. There continues to be a significant need to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, not just within our system, but broadly across the United States. On the water side, there are 1 million miles of pipes in the United States, and there's a major main break every two minutes. The country loses about 2 trillion gallons of treated water every year through more than 240,000 main breaks. That's roughly 20% of all treated water in the United States. On the wastewater side, through about 800,000 miles of collection pipes in the United States, many of those pipes are in dire need of replacement and pose a risk to groundwater. Every year, nearly a trillion gallons of untreated sewage are discharged into our rivers and streams. We understand the urgent need for a well-planned and executed asset renewal and upgrade plan to drive monetization, improve efficiency and increase reliability and resiliency. Our 2021 to 2025 capital plan includes an increase of $1.3 billion, reflecting the continued needs in our existing systems, as well as the increase in potential regulated acquisitions. Bill Varley will give more detail on our pipeline of acquisition opportunities in a moment. We expect our market-based businesses to contribute about 1% of our growth over the next five years, compared to our prior plan. This slightly lower growth rate is not a reflection of slower growth at our market-based businesses, but rather the increasing growth potential we see from regulated acquisitions. As a reminder, our capital-light market-based businesses generate cash as well as enhance our customer experience. And again, we're incredibly proud to provide water and wastewater services to the men and women of our military at 17 installations. These components of our triangle give us confidence that we can continue to grow our long-term EPS CAGR of 7% to 10% over the next five years. Let me now talk about our capital plan in greater detail. We're committed to providing safe and reliable water and wastewater services to the hundreds of communities we serve. We achieve this level of service by incorporating established best practices in our operations and implementing an investment strategy that balances infrastructure needs with affordability for our customers. American Water has a demonstrated ability to service and maintain distribution and treatment infrastructure, including improving water quality, fixing leaks, and providing water for fire hydrants to name just a few. These efforts help communities remain strong and attractive to residents and businesses. We plan to spend $1.9 billion in 2021 and about $10.4 billion over the next five years. Again, that's a $1.3 billion increase over the plan we share with you last year. The largest component of this investment is infrastructure renewal, which is primarily for pipe replacement and upgrading water and wastewater treatment facilities. Over the next five years, we plan to replace about 2,200 miles of pipes and makes significant upgrades to our water and wastewater facilities across our footprint. We're also making needed investments to enhance water quality, as well as taking steps to improve our water sources. Every water provider must be prepared to address a broader range of contaminants and be ready to meet more stringent regulations. Finally, we'll invest in new technologies to enhance our customer experience and enable our employees to drive efficiencies. On the longer horizon, you can see that we plan to spend approximately $22 billion to $25 billion in our regulated business over the next 10 years. American Water's investment thesis is unique because the predictable and stable way we deploy our capital. Our capital deployment is made up of many small investments across our footprint, which gives us the flexibility to scale our infrastructure investment plan up and down as capital needed for regulated acquisitions may vary because of deal timing. You can see that we set aside $3 billion to $4 billion for regulated acquisitions. Let me also point out that our capital investment generates significant economic benefits to the local and regional economies. According to the U.S. Water Alliance for every million dollars, we invest in our infrastructure. We create 15 high paying jobs for our communities. So our plan investment of about $10.4 billion over the next five years has the potential to create over 156,000 jobs in the communities we serve. Let's move to Slide 11 and discuss how we balance the investment opportunities with customer affordability. This is a holistic approach focused on operating and capital efficiencies, constructive regulatory and legislative policies and leveraging the size and scale of our business. It comes down to driving efficiencies in areas where we've been successful, effectively leveraging technology, taking advantage of our size and scale for supply chain, not only around price, but access to critical supplies and driving our cost management through a culture of continuous improvement. When we achieve smart O&M reductions, we can invest in our water and wastewater systems while mitigating the impact on our customer's bills. We continue to improve our O&M efficiency ratio, which I'll discuss in a moment. We reinforce our operational efficiency efforts by also focusing on capital efficiency. We understand that driving capital efficiency allows us to do more with the same amount of money. We employ a value engineering step in all our large projects to optimize costs and performance of a project. We also continue to receive timely recovery of our investments through regulatory mechanisms across our footprint. These mechanisms reduce regulatory lag and extend the time between general rate case filings, which enables us to mitigate the size of any rate increase. I would note that 64% of capital recovery comes from regulatory mechanisms. We continue to engage with policymakers in similar efforts to support critical investments in solutions to water and wastewater challenges. Finally, our large customer base plays an important part, minimizing customer bill impact for this needed investment. We're able to spread the cost of these investments over a large customer base. And again, leverage our efficiencies to minimize customer bill impact. As you know, small water systems across the country aren't able to do this as they grapple with aging infrastructure and contaminants that threaten the quality of their drinking water. Let's move to Slide 12 for other ways, where strategically managing costs. We take a strategic approach to managing our costs, centered on deploying, enabling technology, leveraging our supply chain and embracing our culture of continuous improvement. Our technology is three areas of focus, enabling our employees, enhancing our customer experience and driving best-in-class operations. Technology enables us to drive efficiencies in our business and to provide an excellent customer experience, whether it's through automating manual tasks so employees can focus on higher value work, making data available to customers so they can better manage their usage or leveraging automatic meter reading solutions with an intelligent alert system to detect and fix leaks earlier. We continue to drive efficiencies through our supply chain. Just last year, we saved over $80 million by leveraging our buying power across our business. For example, we saved more than $50 million on pipes and vehicles, and we replicated this effort in other areas such as chemicals, valves, construction materials, and safety supplies. Our team has established strong relationships with key suppliers to ensure we have priority when items are essential to operating our business or in short supply. This was especially important during the initial phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. None of this would be possible without our people. Our employees are passionate about our customers and know how savings directly benefit them by keeping their bills affordable. We enable our employees to find better, more efficient ways to work. This is our culture, and it's been so instrumental to our success in driving efficiencies. Our employees understand that for every operating dollar we take out of the business, we can invest $8 in capital with no customer bill impact. Moving to Slide 13. You can see that we continue to make steady progress and driving efficiencies in our business. Over the past 10 years, our O&M efficiency ratio has gone from 46.1% to below 35%. And we've challenged ourselves with a new O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025. We're confident in our ability to hit that target. Just to put that into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since that time, we welcomed approximately 322,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1%. That could only be done with the great work of our employees and our commitment to controlling costs and keeping bills affordable for our customers. Our market-based businesses are complimentary to our regulated business, they're capital-light businesses, and they provide positive cash flow to help us with our growth in the overall business. Homeowner services now serves approximately 1.5 million customers, reaching that customer milestone is a testament to our ongoing dedication and commitment to serving our customers, delivering quality protection programs and fostering innovation in the home warranty sector. Our military services group is the largest provider of water and wastewater services for the military, now probably serving 17 installations across the country. We were also extremely honored in 2020 to be awarded Department of Defense contracts for the water and wastewater systems at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington State. It's truly an honor to serve the men and women who serve our country. Let's turn to the next slide and I'll conclude my remarks before turning it over to Bill. We have a clear strategy focused on what we do best. Our future success is based on our proven success. Our long-term perspective has informed our business strategy and it starts by operating where we can create value, leverage our critical mass, drive efficiencies and increase opportunities to provide water and wastewater solutions. Our regulated investment remains the foundation of our growth and we'll balance that investment through strategic cost management. We'll continue to focus on our customers and enhance their experience through technology, efficiencies and innovation. Our market-based businesses will continue to compliment our regulated business through operating results, free cash flow, and an enhanced customer experience. And finally, it's not just what we do, but how we do it. That's at the core of our ESG philosophy. It's who we are today and how we plan to challenge ourselves in the future. Let me now turn the call over to Bill to talk about our strategic growth. Thank you, Susan. Proven and predictable financial performance is an outcome of the successful execution of our strategies. I think you've clearly heard today that we're confident in our long-term success. This confidence is rooted in our strengths, it starts and ends with our unwavering commitment to safety. To us, safety is more than just the right thing to do. The health and safety of our team is a leading indicator of our company's health. Simply put, if we can get safety, right, we can get everything else right. To excel we must get the fundamentals, right. Operational excellence helps us define better and more efficient ways to do business and it enables us to provide safe, clean and affordable water services for our customers. As the largest water and wastewater company in United States, we assume the responsibility to go beyond minimum requirements and be an industry leader in operational and environmental excellence. This can only be achieved by collaborative high-performing teams. Maintaining an environment, where our people feel valued, included and empowered it's critical to our ability to serve customers every day. We're working together to create an environment where employees can live up to their fullest potential and feel confident that they can directly contribute to our company's ability to stay strong, grow and make a difference in our customer's lives. And making a difference for our customers and for the communities we serve is centered on providing solutions to water and wastewater challenges. When we grow, we're able to leverage our scale, we can invest more, we can create stable jobs and we can improve infrastructure and make communities stronger, and for some ESG is a relatively recent development. For American Water, it's an affirmation of the values we've upheld for decades, it's much broader than just three words, it includes environmental leadership and sustainability, operational excellence, employee engagement, safety and equality, active community engagement, civic and charitable involvement and transparency and good governance. All are foundational to our corporate strategy. Turning to Slide 41. American Water has been recognized for our leadership and ongoing commitment to integrating ESG principles throughout our business. From sustainability to supplier diversity, to our commitment, to an inclusive culture, we're incredibly proud of these achievements. But we know we have got much more work to do. In all these categories, we're never finished. I personally want to thank our employees. They are so engaged in every aspect of ESG, it matters to them. Like our investors who expect us to live up to ESG principles, so do our employees. In conclusion, here is what you can expect from us. Our fundamental investment strategy remains, we're affirming our long-term EPS CAGR of 7% to 10%. We plan to invest about $10.4 billion in the next five years, an increase of $1.3 billion over last year's plan, we expect an increase of potential regulated acquisitions, now in the range of 1.5% to 2.5% EPS CAGR, we plan for dividend growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% growth range, and we'll continue to champion or high-performing culture, focused on safety and inclusion and diversity. We're confident in our ability to continue as a top leader in the utility sector. And we hope today's presentation has provided you with a transparent strategic path to our long-term success. Before we take your questions, I'd offer you this thought, financially successful companies are frequently recognized nationally and internationally for strong performance and that's important. But for us, success is about enabling our employees to perform at their best. It's about leading a team of extraordinary people doing critical work. It's about investing in people, communities, and helping our country solve its water and wastewater challenges. We're excited about our future and we thank you for being on this journey with us. Before we take a quick break, I would like to turn it back to Ed Vallejo for information about participating in our question-and-answer session. Angie, Walter here, how are you? I'm going to take that question. So let me start by just apologizing for the issues with the webcast, if you missed any of the 30 to 60 seconds, let me tell you in my section, it was fabulous. So I would ask you to go back and look at it again. So the 1.5% to 2.5%, that's a reflection of the growing pipeline that we have, Bill Varley working with the State teams have been hard at it to truly identify opportunities and then work them through our pipeline. And right now, we believe that we're confident that the pipeline supports that increase up to 1.5% to 2.5%, so that's really the reason for the growing part of that growth triangle. Yes. Let me start with what's going on there and then Susan can talk about that. Yes, we still \u2013 we're working structurally with the public service commission as we work towards the sale of the system there. We still believe it's in the best interest of New York American Water customers to sell the Liberty. As you know on February 3, the governor directed a special council to complete a study on the feasibility of a public takeover, and that study is to be completed by April 1. So while we remain confident in the sale the date of that work and the outcome of that work may impact our timing to some degree. Yes, Angie, they have not ruled on it yet. Thanks, Durgesh. Yes, thanks Durgesh. Well, as you know we increased our pipeline and almost doubled it over the last year and it's really focusing in the States where we want to grow and focusing on both water and wastewater. We're still pursuing wastewater opportunities in areas where we serve water customers and also adjacent to where we serve water customers. And I think if you look at the city of New York wastewater, that's a perfect example of that. But it's really a combination of the States doing a tremendous job in identifying opportunities and working them through the pipeline. But also the team here led by Bill, working with the States to look at best practices and things that we can take advantage of across our scale of our business. So that's why really the increase is there, but it's really back to the pipeline, it's all about a pipeline, you have to have a pipeline to deliver on those acquisitions. Bill, if there is anything you want to add. We moved it from 1% to 2% to 1%, and it's really a reflection of the regulated business growing at a faster clip and particularly the regulated acquisitions that we identified. So that's really what's driving that, we're still very confident in our market-based businesses, both in the military and homeowner services. In the military, as you know, we won the last three awards where there are five outstanding, we expect two to be awarded in the near-term and we're confident in our ability to continue to provide great service for the men and women in the military. So we're confident in both businesses and they contribute to the success of our organization. So the very complimentary to what we do and they provide free cash flow and we're able to extend our core competencies, particularly on the military side and provide a great service for the 17 installations. Exactly. Thanks, Durgesh. We can. Yes, thanks Insoo. And you're right, we don't have regulated operations in Texas. We do have two military bases where we provide water and wastewater service Joint Base San Antonio and then Fort Hood. And I've got to say, I'm so proud of our teams and the work they've done around the clock to continue to provide service. And while we experienced many more main breaks and other challenges within the systems, our folks kept the water running for our military folks on those bases, so we're really, really proud of them. As far as the Texas operations, I mean, there is a little bit different design and construction down in Texas because they're not really designed to withstand extended periods of cold weather, and that's been the challenge down there. And so when a storm like that hits, it really challenges the system from a number of perspectives. The pipes are not buried very deep. Many of them are above ground and they tend to freeze at a much quicker pace. And a lot of the homes are not insulated like they are in the Northeast. So that's really what contributed to a lot of the issues down there. Our systems are resilient. We spend a lot of money, as Cheryl said, 8% of our capital spend is spent on resiliency in our systems to make sure that our systems can withstand extended periods of cold weather. And we do a great job at it. And while we have at times many more main breaks, our teams are out repairing those main breaks and restoring service in the shortest amount of time. So I'm really proud again, of our operations in Texas as two military bases. And again, our systems are designed and constructed to withstand extended periods of cold weather. We continually assess where we want to operate and for us \u2013 we've said many times for us to enter a state, we've got to have a good regulatory environment, a good business environment, and the ability to grow to at least 50,000 customers roughly over a five-year period. So we'll continue to assess entry points in the different states using that methodology. But we're again really proud of our efforts down there and we've responded and helped the communities down there by shipping a bottle of water. We're really proud of that as well, because that's who we are as a company coming to the aid of people in this country, even though they're not our customers. Yes, I think we believe there's going to be an infrastructure bill. We don't believe there's going to be any free money going out to the municipalities. We think there'll be access to low interest loans for the state revolving funds, and we're working to get access to that. On the wastewater side, we do get access on the water side, but we're working to get access on the wastewater side. So we can \u2013 our customers can benefit like the other customers through a low interest loans. But our five-year plan is an increase of 1.3 billion over the last plan from last year. And we're going to continue to invest in the areas that we need to invest in and make sure our systems are resilient. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, thanks for that, Ryan we continually assess where we want to operate and where we can provide the best customer service, most efficient operations and continue to grow. And we'll just continue to do that. We're not in any position now to say that. Thank you. Yes. And it's really about the targeted investment that Cheryl said in replacing pipe that's old and worn out and maybe more prone to main breaks and also leveraging technology to identify leaks there. Those are two key areas for us to continue to improve in that area, Verity. Susan, you want to take that or I can jump in? Any other question, Jonathan, it's timely. Thanks Jonathan Yes, thanks for the question, Becca. I think one of the areas and it's been out there for some time is really the PFAS limits. And again, there's a health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion. Many states have enacted more stringent standards, but I think the EPA maybe monitored or coming up with a limit on that would be one area of focus for the Biden Administration. I know it's going to take some time and the EPA likes to focus on science to make their MCLs, but I think that's going to be a key area as they establish that, they'll continue to look at other emerging contaminants. And that will play again into our acquisition strategy as we continue to provide solutions for communities. And we think there is going to be a keen focus here by the EPA. Cheryl, is there anything you want to add to that? Well, let me start with Water Quality Accountability Act that started in New Jersey that two other states have adopted. I think that is being considered in other states within our footprint. So I would look out for that primarily in the Midwest and that again, establishes standards that are uniform across the sector, whether a municipally-owned or investor-owned, around cybersecurity, some of the challenges there, around pipe replacement rates, about long-term asset management plans. And that's been instrumental in many of the discussions we've had in the states where we operate that have that legislation. So I think it's a wake up call for many municipalities to say, maybe we should talk to American Water about selling assistance. Thank you. Okay. Thanks Racco. First, let me say thanks for joining us today, and we value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and the investment in our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team and they'll be happy to answer them. Thanks again for joining us and please stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Bill Varley",
            "content": "Thanks, Walter. Hi. I'm Bill Varley, Chief Growth Officer for American Water. Prior to my current role, I've held many leadership positions at our company, including President of New Jersey American Water, Senior Vice President for the Northeast and Midwest divisions and Deputy COO. Before I review our growth strategy, let's take a look at the landscape of the utility industry in general. Our industry is highly fragmented, there are more than 50,000 community water systems and approximately 15,000 community wastewater systems in the United States compare that to the U.S. electric utilities, which are comprised of approximately 3,800 systems and gas utilities, which are even more consolidated with approximately 1,400 system. The water industry's fragmentation provides ample opportunities for systems consolidate and bring efficiencies across the entire sector. To put that in perspective on the water side, 84% of the population is served by municipal water systems. And more than 90% of those systems serve a population of 10,000 people or less. This is significant for two reasons. First, these numbers illustrate the large volume opportunities available. Second, many of these smaller communities are facing infrastructure challenges that require capital investment, due to competing priorities funds may or may not be readily available. And the large amount of capital invested required must be distributed across a small customer. This can significantly impact rates and affordability. Because of our scale, we're able to spread capital investment costs over a much larger customer base, help we can maintain affordability for our customers. Opportunities on the wastewater side are also significant because many of these systems are already part or near our water footprint. This gives us the opportunity to leverage our existing infrastructure and drive operational and cost efficiencies. Let's move to the next slide. Beyond our scale, other competitive advantages include a large customer base. Let me take you through an example where both scale and a large customer base played an important role prior to New Jersey American Water acquiring the water and wastewater systems of Haddonfield, New Jersey, the town faced the daunting need to invest over $20 million in capital improvements over a short timeframe. This investment was required to maintain compliance for their wastewater system and to make necessary improvements to their aging water infrastructure. These costs would have significantly increased rates for their 10,000 customer connections. When New Jersey American Water purchase Haddonfield system, we're able to spread the capital costs across a customer base of over 650,000 connections throughout New Jersey. Our ability to leverage scale of our footprint enables us to accelerate the capital program. At the same time, rate impacts were far less than if the town had decided to do the work themselves. Deep utility experience and expertise was also relevant in Haddonfield, as it is in other acquisitions. We have a culture of continuous improvement and our employees are passionate about finding solutions and serving our customers Technology and purchasing capabilities along with our culture of continuous improvement, also bring added benefits. As Walter mentioned, for every dollar of O&M costs, we can remove from the business. We can invest $8 of capital without increasing customer bills. Another advantage is our ability to acquire wastewater systems within or near our water footprint. Our water operations make up approximately 93% of our business while wastewater is only 7%. This presents a tremendous opportunity because we have the operational infrastructure, equipment, expertise, personnel, and relationships with communities where we already provide water services. It's a natural transition to acquire wastewater services. And it is an important piece of our growth strategy. We've executed multiple successful wastewater acquisitions adjacent to and within states with existing water operations, for example, in Scranton and Exeter, Pennsylvania, we added 31,000 and 9,000 wastewater customer connections, respectively. And in Illinois, we had 23,000 wastewater customer connections. Let's now move to the next slide and see how regulatory and legislative policy also helps drive water and wastewater solutions. We continue to engage with state legislators and regulators on policies, which we believe benefit existing and future customers. Let's talk about three examples, fair market value legislation, consolidated tariffs and legislation around water quality, accountability. Fair market value legislation enables communities to receive a fair value for their systems, in turn the water or wastewater purchaser earns on the appraised value of the system, rather than the book value as was historically the case. The appraised value is then included in rate base as long as the commission is deemed reasonable. The latest states within our footprint to enact fair market value legislation include West Virginia and Iowa. 10 out of the 15 states we serve now have some form of fair market legislation. Next is consolidated tariffs, we have that legislation now in 12 states. This legislation allows us to purchase systems, integrate them into our operations and share those costs across a bigger customer base, minimizing customer bill impact. The last example is the water quality accountability legislation, which directly benefits customers and communities, as it holds all water providers to the same standards. The first state to enact this was New Jersey with the Water Quality Accountability Act. This act requires cybersecurity programs, capital asset management programs, and responding to notices of violations in the same way across all systems. Additionally, it requires all systems to establish a maximum 150 year pipe replacement program to help ensure infrastructure reliability. At American Water, our pipe replacement rate is slightly over 100 years. Because of our asset management program we remain well positioned in New Jersey and across our footprint to meet these requirements. We have seen other states adopt similar legislations, such as Indiana and Missouri. Let's now shift our attention to updating you on our acquisition activities. Since 2015, we've completed 106 acquisitions and have added over 211,000 customer connections. Of the 106 acquisitions, 62 were water acquisitions, totaling 52,000 connections. 44 were wastewater adding 159,000 customers. In 2020, we completed 23 acquisitions in 10 states, totaling approximately 38,000 customer connections. Regarding our focus to increase our wastewater acquisitions of the 38,000 customer connections added over 24,000 were wastewater. This total does not include over 14,500 customer connections attributed to organic growth. We're off to a good start in 2021 with a total of 27 acquisitions under agreement in six states, representing approximately 30,000 customer connections. As you can see, we've increased our five-year opportunity pipeline by 50% over the past year, from 800,000 customer connections to over 1.2 million. When developing our pipeline, we first look to our optimal target range of 5,000 to 50,000 customer connections. Then we conduct the evaluation. This evaluation is not just focused on financial needs, but also looking to provide solutions for potential water quality, operational and wastewater compliance needs, challenges that are increasingly burdensome to communities. Other criteria that we use to evaluate opportunities include enhancing the quality of life for residents and local businesses, whether it be economic development for growth, social programs, or overall community services to name a few. Once systems have been identified, we proactively engage with the communities to see where and how we can provide solutions. You can see on the right here are some of the targets we're working on over the next five years. This list clearly shows that our growth is not contingent on any one deal, but multiple deals across our footprint. And as you can also see the size of these potential deals is also increasing. Let's take a moment to discuss the process and the timeline of acquisition from opportunity assessment, development of agreements to the final close and inclusion in rate base. This process can take a minimum of 18 months to several years to complete, usually starts with a robust bid and procurement process, community approval, regulatory approval and then the final inclusion in rate base as part of a general rate case. Our increased pipeline, our proactive approach to engage in communities and our competitive advantages position as well to achieve our EPS growth target related to acquisitions. Regarding New York, Pennsylvania, in January of this year, Pennsylvania American Water was a successful bidder to quiet the wastewater treatment collection system for the city of New York. We are currently working through the process, but this potential agreement were in an equivalent of 45,000 customer connections, it also shows how American Water plays a role in providing solutions for communities and enhancing the lives of the customers we serve. Let's move to the last slide. In summary, as we've added more capital to our plan, our regulated acquisition target has been raised from 1% to 2% to 1.5% to 2.5%. We tend to achieve this by executing on fundamentals, which are a continued focus on water system acquisitions in our target range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers and consideration for larger acquisitions where appropriate, a focus on wastewater acquisitions in or near a water footprint, continuing engagement on legislative and regulatory policy to benefit customers and an increased development of our opportunity pipeline through a proactive approach. By executing on our fundamentals, we firmly believe are well positioned to meet our increased growth targets. Now I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk about ESG. Yes. Hi, Durgesh, how are you doing? In part of the pipeline development, it's a discipline approach to evaluation Durgesh, and we're not just looking for financial conditions, we take a look at the water quality, looking at wastewater compliance and what are the community needs are too. So we're looking at solutions and it's a systematic process that we go through. And to the aspect of increasing the pipeline on the wastewater side, 93% of our business is the water side. But I think now the realization is that they actually \u2013 if communities is sitting on an asset that has value, which they didn't realize before by our proactive approach, and also the view is potential liability. So, you combine all the factors with a discipline approach, increasing the pipeline, I think that's what gives us our confidence"

Following the earnings conference call, an audio archive of the call will be available through November 12, 2020. U.S. callers may access the audio archive toll-free by dialing 1 (877) 344-7529. International callers may listen by dialing 1 (412) 317-0088. The access code for the replay is 10149253. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website at ir.amwater.com/events.\n I would like now to introduce you to your host for today's call, Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vallejo, you may begin. \nEdward Vallejo: Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will, as usual, open the call for your questions. \n During this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and other factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our September 30, 2020, Form 10-Q, each as filed with the SEC. \n Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information discussed on this earnings conference call, specifically, O&M efficiency ratio and return on equity, can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide deck for this call. Also, this slide deck has been posted to our Investor Relations page on our website. \n All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. \n And I should note that consistent with our efforts to ensure the safety and health of our team, we are again conducting this call while practicing social distancing and from remote locations. As an example, Walter and Susan remain in separate locations. If for any reason, technical issues do arise, Walter will take over and lead us through the full presentation.\n And with that, I will turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Walter Lynch. \nWalter Lynch: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot to cover today. I'll start with a few comments on the national election, then move to key updates on our business, including our continued focus on the implications of COVID-19. Susan will then provide a more detailed review of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results along with other updates.\n So let me start with Tuesday's election. American Water has and will continue to work with both sides of the isle in constructive water policy. Water and wastewater infrastructure remain a bipartisan issue, and we'll stay engaged with leaders at the state and federal level on this issue on behalf of our customers. We continue to believe that investment in the country's water and wastewater infrastructure is important. Supportive legislation and regulation are also critical to ensure customer bills are affordable.\n Let's move to Slide 5 and our third quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our results were driven by the continued execution of our strategies. Our third quarter 2020 earnings per share were up 9.8% compared to third quarter 2019. We invested capital of $1.38 billion in the first 3 quarters of 2020, which is a 10.4% increase over the same period last year. We balanced that investment through our focused effort to control cost as we work towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. We've added more than 47,000 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 19,000 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2021. \n As it relates to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, safety continues to be our top priority. Susan will give more detail in a minute, but as you saw in our 10-Q, residential demand continued higher, and we saw some rebound in commercial demand as businesses started to reopen. As a result of this higher demand in the third quarter, we saw an estimated favorable impact of $0.03 per share. We'll continue to assess the situation across our service territory. \n Recognizing that it's difficult to predict the impact, we currently anticipate a full year unfavorable $0.03 to $0.06 per share from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Also included in the results is an estimated $0.06 per share favorable impact in 2020 from hotter, drier weather across some of our regulated states. This compares to $0.04 per share unfavorable impact for the same period in 2019 from wetter-than-normal conditions in both the Midwest and Northeast.\n Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. We were very proud to announce that our Military Services Group was awarded the contract for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater utility systems at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. We're now honored to provide water and wastewater services to more than 425,000 military men, women and their families at 17 installations across the United States.\n Moving to Slide 6. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. \n We're increasing our 2020 earnings range to $3.87 to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This reflects the favorable weather in the quarter. We're also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on October 26, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on December 2, 2020.\n Turning to Slide 7. Let's go through some of the regulatory highlights of the third quarter 2020. We currently have 5 pending rate cases, and I'll cover the more significant development since our last call. Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a settlement between New Jersey American Water, BPU staff and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel for new water and wastewater rates. The new rates represent a $39 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenues. In a separate proceeding, the BPU also approved a customer credit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will offset the rate increase for the average residential customer through August 31, 2021. While the customer credit will benefit customer bills, it will have no earnings impact in New Jersey American Water as it's offset by lower tax expense during this period. The company's rate case was driven by more than $1 billion in infrastructure investments since the last rate case. \n Last week, Pennsylvania American Water and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement entered into a settlement agreement, providing for a total annualized revenue increase of $70.5 million over a 2-year period. The terms of the proposed settlement have been presented for review to the PUC Administrative Law Judge. Until the Administrative Law Judge and Commission are able to review their proposed settlement and render their decisions, it would be premature to discuss the terms of the settlement any further. As you recall, Pennsylvania American Water's general rate case requested $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022. \n We also have pending rate cases in Missouri, Iowa, California and Virginia, and those cases are moving along on schedule.\n Also, in California, the California Public Utility Commission released the decision in September under its Low-income Ratepayer Assistance Program rulemaking. The decision will require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism, or WRAM, in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which will become effective in January 2024. California American Water has filed an application for a rehearing of the decision.  \n Finally, in September, and after careful consideration, California American Water withdrew a portion of its application at the California Coastal Commission for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project in an effort to further educate stakeholders on environmental and water supply benefits of the project. The company will be resubmitting its application in the near future, and once submitted, by statute, the California Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process after it deems the application complete.\n Lastly, regarding the sale of New York American Water. Last week, the governor announced proposed legislation that would include a PSC study of a public takeover option. We'll review the legislation when a bill is introduced. We still firmly believe the sale of New York American Water to Liberty is in the best interest of our customers, and we'll continue to take the needed steps to close the transaction in early 2021. \n Regarding state legislation. We've seen multiple states take action to help tackle water and wastewater challenges. In Indiana, legislation passed that authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case. And separate legislation passed that establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities to establish fair market value and a reasonable purchase price. Iowa amended legislation that gives the Iowa Utilities Board 180 days to approve acquisitions and allows systems to qualify as a distressed system when they don't have a certified operator. Virginia also signed its version of fair market value legislation into law this year, and West Virginia passed a bill that allows for expanded asset valuation, combined water and wastewater ratemaking and expansion of how municipalities can use proceeds from the sale of a water or wastewater system.\n Moving on to Slide 8. In addition to legislative action to help communities solve water and wastewater challenges, we believe our commitment to putting customers first is key to growing our regulated footprint. As I mentioned, so far in 2020, we've closed on 20 acquisitions in 9 different states, adding approximately 36,200 new customer connections. We've also added approximately 10,900 customer connections through organic growth through 9 months. We look forward to adding another 19,000 customer connections to currently sign agreements in 7 states. Also, the pipeline of opportunities we've noted are a result of increased conversations we're having across our footprint with communities looking for solutions to water and wastewater challenges. These opportunities are in various stages of development, and as you know, the process can take multiple years. \n We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now, and our mission is to help make those communities better because we're there. This includes our recent acquisitions of the city of Jerseyville water and wastewater system in Illinois and the Long Hill sewer system in New Jersey. According to the city of Jerseyville mayor, William Russell, \"We can trust that our water and wastewater systems are in professional, caring hands.\" \n Moving on to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.2% compared to 34.8% for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2019. Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 317,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.9%. This is incredible work by our employees. \n Finally, before I turn the call over to Susan, I want to thank all American Water employees for their commitment to safety as we continue to provide essential services during this pandemic. I also want to send a special thanks to our employees in California, who once again, are safely and successfully providing critical water service as that state deals with catastrophic wildfires.\n And with that, let me turn it over to Susan. \nM. Hardwick: Thanks, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 11 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. Third quarter 2020 consolidated earnings were $1.46 per share compared to $1.33 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned, included in earnings is an estimated $0.06 per share favorable weather impact. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.14 per share or an increase of 10.8% compared to 2019 earnings. The Market-Based Business results were flat to the prior year, and the parent company decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019. \n Our 2020 earnings through September 30 were $3.11 per share or a 7.6% increase over the same period last year. Results for the 9-month period include an estimated $0.10 per share increase year-over-year from warmer and drier-than-normal weather in the third quarter of 2020 versus wetter-than-normal conditions in the second quarter of 2019. \n Also, for the year-to-date period, results reflect $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting and an estimated $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.32 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share, and finally, the parent results decreased by $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business and the sale of a legacy investment in 2019.\n Moving to Slide 12. Let me walk through the third quarter results by business. The Regulated Operations increased $0.11 per share before considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the quarter. We saw a $0.16 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. As I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.06 per share increase from favorable weather in various parts of our service territory. O&M expense increased by $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.05 per share, net of the $0.01 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting. \n The Market-Based Business third quarter results in 2020 were consistent with 2019, and the parent results decreased $0.01 per share, reflecting higher interest expense. \n And lastly, there was an estimated $0.03 per share favorable net impact from the COVID-19 pandemic as demand revenues in the regulated business improved, primarily in the residential customer class. During the quarter, we saw residential demand increase 13.6%. The increase reflects the impact of weather, normal changes in demand, growth and certainly the impact of more stay-at-home activities. Further, during the quarter, we saw commercial and industrial volumes improve to nearly flat year-over-year, reflective of what we expected, at least, a partial recovery as local communities began to reopen. Recall, we saw commercial volumes down 10.3% through the second quarter. \n In the third quarter, we have seen the impact of the pandemic on the Homeowner Services Group from delays in new partnerships and a launch of new products. And we started to see some recovery with 2 new partnership adds in the third quarter as companies are able to start to prioritize normal operations. And the ability to fully estimate the impact of the pandemic is challenging, as Walter said, but the anecdotal information from our state teams and our Market-Based Business team validates the trends we have seen in the third quarter.\n Moving to Slide 13. 9-month EPS increased 7.6% year-over-year. Regulated Operations increased $0.32 per share for the period, and we saw $0.48 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and an estimated $0.10 per share increase from weather year-over-year. O&M expense increased by $0.16 per share and depreciation increased $0.10 per share, net of the $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded on assets held for sale. The Market-Based Businesses increased $0.04 per share due to Joint Base in San Antonio and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York going into full operation as of June 1, 2020, for military services as well as price increases and organic growth in Homeowner Services. Parent results decreased $0.12 per share, largely driven by $0.03 per share due to the sale of a legacy investment in 2019, and a $0.05 per share increase in interest expense. \n The estimated net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is $0.02 per share unfavorable for the year-to-date period. As mentioned, in the regulated business, increased demand in the residential customer class has largely offset decreases in revenue from the commercial and industrial classes to date. Though the second quarter trend was a bit more negative, as we discussed, our initial intuition was that this offset would ultimately be the case. The unknown remains, though, as we -- as to how long and to what degree the pandemic continues. As we continue to watch these rate case-- these case rates increase in many of our territories, it's possible that additional restrictions are put in place that could, again, negatively impact demand for our commercial customers.\n Moving on to Slide 14. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. As of October 31, the Regulated Business received $127 million in annualized new revenues in 2020. This includes $57 million from rate cases, including step increases; and $70 million from infrastructure surcharges. Included in this number is the outcome from our most recent rate case in New Jersey, as Walter mentioned, at the start of the call. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on the 5 rate cases previously discussed by Walter and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $212 million. \n From a regulatory perspective, we are continuing to work diligently to address the impact of the pandemic in our service territories. As of today, we have commissioned orders, authorizing deferred accounting for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of our 14 jurisdictions, with 3 proceedings pending in Kentucky, Tennessee and New York. Essentially, all direct costs and foregone revenues are being captured for future recovery. Currently, the bottom line impact on the regulated business from the pandemic is the estimated variance in demand revenues, as we just discussed, and the minor impact on Homeowner Services.\n Moving on to Slide 15. As Walter said, we now expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.87 per share to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This guidance range reflects the favorable benefit of weather year-to-date and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. It reflects an estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the assets held for sale accounting, and it also reflects an estimated $0.03 to $0.06 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we've said throughout this call, the full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which could include the length and severity of any impact on the demand for services and the nature and scope of any regulatory solutions.\n Finally, moving on to Slide 16. As Walter noted, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock in October. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years against the target of the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. \n As we've discussed all year, our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% now for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with the strong results from our Market-Based Businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We continue to believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations provides excellent value for our investors. The decades of investment need continues and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape, and as state and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. We see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like we are seeing with the current pandemic.\n And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for a few additional remarks. \nWalter Lynch: Yes. Thanks, Susan. Let me cover 2 more items before taking any of your questions. First, we plan to talk with you in February as we wrap up 2020 to discuss our 2021 earnings guidance and our long-term plan, including discussion on our ESG goals. In anticipation of that, you can expect that our plan of focusing on growth from infrastructure investment will continue. Additionally, we'll be meeting with many of you at the Virtual EEI Financial Conference next week. We look forward to talking with you all then. \n Second, as you all know, Veterans Day is next week. I'd like to take a moment to thank all the men and women who served and protected our country. As you may know, I graduated from West Point, was honored to serve as an army officer for more than 5 years. I'm proud to be a veteran and equally proud that American Water is a culture that reflects the support of our military. This year, we've been recognized by 2 veterans publications, U.S. Veterans Magazine and Military Times, receiving the honor as a top veteran-friendly company for having a top supplier diversity program and being among the top 100 Best for Vets Employers. And most recently, American Water received the highest recognition given by the U.S. government to employers, 2020 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, for exemplary support of National Guard and Reserve employees. We're extremely proud of this recognition, and we'll continue to work with and support those who serve our country. \n With that, we're happy to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America. \nRyan Greenwald: So maybe if we could start with the military business. Could you provide some color around contribution with the new military bases after the latest wins? And then further, do you have any visibility to other opportunities that can materialize in the near term? \nWalter Lynch: Well, let me take that, and Susan can jump in. But we don't break out the earnings from Military Services, we just do it on a segment basis for a number of reasons, but we just don't do that. But I can also talk to -- we're in 4 different solicitations right now, and we expect to hear back on 2 in the near term. So just a reminder, we won the last 3 major awards from the military, and we're really proud to be able to support the military and their families. \nRyan Greenwald: Got it. But nothing you can provide in terms of color around contribution at this point? \nWalter Lynch: No. No. I'm sorry, Ryan. We don't break that out like that. \nRyan Greenwald: Fair enough. And then maybe if you could just talk about how you're framing timing of equity. I know you guys kind of alluded in the past that maybe in the middle of the plan, but curious if that mindset has changed at all given the strength of shares. \nM. Hardwick: Yes. This is Susan. We have not changed our timing, and really, the timing that we have laid out in the plan -- and you're right, we had indicated in December, when we rolled out this current plan, that we had anticipated an issue somewhere in the middle of that 5-year period. That is still our current thinking. And it's really tied to when we need the proceeds, when we need some additional funding for the capital plan that we have laid out. As you recall, from December, we increased our capital expectation for the 5-year period and then obviously, rolled out our 10-year plan. And the equity issue we have in the current plan really supports the timing of when we think the investment occurs and when we really need the funding. And I just don't see any need to change that at this point. \nRyan Greenwald: Got it. And then just lastly, on the New York American Water sale process, can you dive a little bit more into that in terms of the milestones from here and the process going forward in terms of the time line? \nWalter Lynch: Yes. As I said in the remarks, Ryan, we still expect to close this in early 2021, and so we're working on an established time line. We're still confident that we can get there. Even as the governor has talked about proposed legislation, we don't think that would slow this down. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. \nInsoo Kim: First question is for Susan. Remind us, in the results and in the guidance, what COVID-related costs, including the bad debt, is included or excluded from the results, given the various pending regulatory approvals for those. \nM. Hardwick: Yes. Our guidance overall, as we indicated, we've changed guidance this quarter, increased it. And included in that guidance range is an assumption of $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable for the year, and that really, I think, reflects our current trends. We saw a fairly substantial impact through the second quarter, and it's recovered some in the third as we saw the commercial business -- the commercial sector come back a bit, and the residential sector, again, continues to be pretty strong growth there. I think the challenge, of course, is to try to estimate how long this thing lasts and what the sort of new surge of cases may, in fact, do to businesses across our service territory, do they go into some additional phase of shutdown. So again, we've tried to capture some assumptions around that in our guidance range of the $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable. Just difficult to predict, obviously, as we see this thing continue to unfold. And it is included in that guidance range that we established.\n I mentioned on the regulatory front, we now have deferral orders in 11 of the 14 jurisdictions, and that really does cover exposures to bad debt expense increases, direct costs associated with the pandemic, et cetera. So really, the impact that falls through, if you will, is just the demand revenue changes that we might see across the service territory. Everything else, the direct costs or direct impacts are captured in those deferral orders. \nInsoo Kim: Got it. And could you quantify just year-to-date what those -- what the deferred costs amount to? \nM. Hardwick: It's disclosed in the Q. I think if you go to that footnote in the Q where we talk about COVID specifically, we've laid out the reg assets recorded, net of some reg liabilities. I don't have the number right in front of me, but it's laid out in the Q for you. \nInsoo Kim: Understood. Second question. Walter, I know you talked about increased communications with various municipal utilities for potential M&A, and I know that's been ongoing every year. But just given the COVID environment and your point earlier on potential focus nationally on water quality and water infrastructure, are you -- do you think, all else equal, you should see an acceleration of mini acquisitions by AWK over the next 2 to 3 years versus the rate that you've seen over the past few years? \nWalter Lynch: Yes, it's a great question. And we're in many conversations with municipalities around the country. One of the reasons is the COVID impact, but still a lot of challenges around water and wastewater infrastructure, and we're a solutions provider. So we're going to continue to talk to municipalities about providing solutions. Our pipeline continues to grow, and we continue to talk to new municipalities. So we'll see where that takes us. Typically, it takes 2 to 5 years to complete these deals, so there is a delay from the time you start talking to them to the time you take ownership, but we're very confident in our ability to provide solutions for our communities. \nM. Hardwick: Let me just quickly tag on to the question there. We do have a net regulatory asset of $26 million recorded at the end of September related to COVID. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: So Walter, in your prepared remarks, you had a comment about some -- one of the states, I admittedly forget which one, that has a legislation that would provide for some adjustments for nonmunicipal systems, water systems being acquired. If you could remind me which one it is? And also, in light of that, I'm just looking at your New Jersey rate case settlement. You -- in the original filing, you asked for this acquisition adjustments mechanism. I don't see it in the settlement. So I just wonder if it means it's still going to be addressed or the settlement basically doesn't cover it i.e., those 3 acquisitions will not be -- well, the goodwill is not going to be added to the rate case basically in New Jersey? \nWalter Lynch: Yes. Let me start with the second question first. The acquisition adjustment will be dealt with separately. And the order -- there was an executive order that came out that said 90 days after the emergency orders lifted is when they have to render decision So we don't have an exact time on it yet, but we're expecting that after the executive -- after the emergency orders lifted. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. That's in New Jersey. And you mentioned some -- which other state has this potential adjustment for nonmunicipal systems?  I thought you mentioned it. \nWalter Lynch: Yes. No, it's Indiana. There is an appraisal process, yes, for the nonmunicipal utilities and really around establishing fair market value and a reasonable purchase price. So yes, Indiana has been a leading state in legislation because they recognize, I think, the importance of what we can do as a company in addressing the water and wastewater challenges. So we're really proud to be working with Indiana legislature and coming up with bills that really affords us the opportunity to do that. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. \nJonathan Reeder: So a question around guidance. Midpoint to midpoint, you're raising at by $0. 04. However, you're citing kind of a net $0.07 to $0.08 benefit assumptions that were originally embedded in your guidance range. So that kind of implies your core results are actually tracking down $0.03 to $0.04 from the original midpoint. What's kind of the driver cause of that? \nM. Hardwick: Jonathan, let me make sure I follow the question and maybe correct one thing. I think, at midpoint, we're up $0.06. We were roughly at $3.84 midpoint before, we're now at $3.90. And that really just was driven by the weather implications. That's the big driver of the of the change in midpoint, I would say. I think, we obviously did narrow the range a bit as we, again, have continued to see a little bit more recovery from the COVID costs than we had anticipated when we were discussing this with you at the second quarter. I recall then, our range was $0.05 to $0.08 unfavorable. We're now $0.03 to $0.06 is our current best guess at that. Obviously, the business continues to perform fundamentally very, very well. We've not seen any real slowdown in our investment opportunities. So the underlying business is performing very well. \nJonathan Reeder: Okay. Well, let me ask it maybe a little bit differently. Historically, I guess, investors have kind of been conditioned to AWK coming in more in the top half of the guidance range. I mean, you guys have done a good job executing. So if it's -- the midpoint is being raised $0.06, despite $0.07 to $0.08 of favorable items, it kind of puts you just a little below that original midpoint. So is there anything that kind of is causing that headwind or expenses not quite as good as you're hoping or rate release delays, anything like that? Not a lot, just a couple of [ venues ], but just kind of curious. \nM. Hardwick: No, really no drivers of that nature. I mean, again, I think we're continuing to understand the impacts of COVID from a short-term and a long-term perspective. But as I said, the underlying business continues to perform quite well. There is always a number of gives and takes in any particular year, but we've not seen anything that's fundamentally changing our expectations about the ability for the business to perform. \nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And then, Walter, I know you guys were going to roll out guidance in February. Should we anticipate you rolling the base year forward 1 year from 2018 to 2019? Or is there a chance you guys use 2020? \nM. Hardwick: We're still looking at that, Jonathan. And I think you'll just have to wait till February, when we come out and give you sort of the full plan. I think, as Walter indicated in his remarks, though, you can expect to see a continued focus on investment in infrastructure. That's what drives this business, and we think we have great opportunity to continue to do that. \nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And then last, I know you said commercial demand revenues weren't down nearly as much in Q3 as it was in Q2. But how did the trends exactly shake out on the residential side? I think Q2 was up only 5%, which was somewhat puzzling. Aqua America, which has some general overlap with your service territories, was up 10%. Where was residential in Q3? \nM. Hardwick: I think we quoted that was up, Ed, you can check me 13%, I think, we said roughly 13% in the quarter, and again, we've laid out by quarter in the 10-Q. Yes, residential is up 13.6% in the quarter. \nWalter Lynch: 13.6%, yes. \nJonathan Reeder: Okay. So that really came back strong or whatever in Q3. \nM. Hardwick: It really did. And then commercial, again, we saw as -- on a year-to-date basis, is really flat to the prior year. So obviously, you would expect growth, right? But we think back flat to year-over-year is an indication that across much of our territory, which, again, we like the geographic diversity of our territory as this thing rolls through the country. Different parts of the country are responding differently in terms of business reopenings, and we've seen that occur through this third quarter. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. \nWalter Lynch: Yes. Thank you for joining our call today. We value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and the investment of our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team, they'll be happy to answer any questions you have. So again, thanks, again, and be safe, everyone. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Walter Lynch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We have a lot to cover today. I'll start with a few comments on the national election, then move to key updates on our business, including our continued focus on the implications of COVID-19. Susan will then provide a more detailed review of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results along with other updates.\n So let me start with Tuesday's election. American Water has and will continue to work with both sides of the isle in constructive water policy. Water and wastewater infrastructure remain a bipartisan issue, and we'll stay engaged with leaders at the state and federal level on this issue on behalf of our customers. We continue to believe that investment in the country's water and wastewater infrastructure is important. Supportive legislation and regulation are also critical to ensure customer bills are affordable.\n Let's move to Slide 5 and our third quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Our results were driven by the continued execution of our strategies. Our third quarter 2020 earnings per share were up 9.8% compared to third quarter 2019. We invested capital of $1.38 billion in the first 3 quarters of 2020, which is a 10.4% increase over the same period last year. We balanced that investment through our focused effort to control cost as we work towards our long-term O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. We've added more than 47,000 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 19,000 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2021. \n As it relates to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, safety continues to be our top priority. Susan will give more detail in a minute, but as you saw in our 10-Q, residential demand continued higher, and we saw some rebound in commercial demand as businesses started to reopen. As a result of this higher demand in the third quarter, we saw an estimated favorable impact of $0.03 per share. We'll continue to assess the situation across our service territory. \n Recognizing that it's difficult to predict the impact, we currently anticipate a full year unfavorable $0.03 to $0.06 per share from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Also included in the results is an estimated $0.06 per share favorable impact in 2020 from hotter, drier weather across some of our regulated states. This compares to $0.04 per share unfavorable impact for the same period in 2019 from wetter-than-normal conditions in both the Midwest and Northeast.\n Moving to our Market-Based Businesses. We were very proud to announce that our Military Services Group was awarded the contract for the operation and maintenance of the water and wastewater utility systems at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington state. We're now honored to provide water and wastewater services to more than 425,000 military men, women and their families at 17 installations across the United States.\n Moving to Slide 6. The foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country. \n We're increasing our 2020 earnings range to $3.87 to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This reflects the favorable weather in the quarter. We're also affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on October 26, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on December 2, 2020.\n Turning to Slide 7. Let's go through some of the regulatory highlights of the third quarter 2020. We currently have 5 pending rate cases, and I'll cover the more significant development since our last call. Last week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a settlement between New Jersey American Water, BPU staff and the New Jersey Division of Rate Counsel for new water and wastewater rates. The new rates represent a $39 million annual increase in water and wastewater revenues. In a separate proceeding, the BPU also approved a customer credit associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that will offset the rate increase for the average residential customer through August 31, 2021. While the customer credit will benefit customer bills, it will have no earnings impact in New Jersey American Water as it's offset by lower tax expense during this period. The company's rate case was driven by more than $1 billion in infrastructure investments since the last rate case. \n Last week, Pennsylvania American Water and the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and Bureau of Investigations and Enforcement entered into a settlement agreement, providing for a total annualized revenue increase of $70.5 million over a 2-year period. The terms of the proposed settlement have been presented for review to the PUC Administrative Law Judge. Until the Administrative Law Judge and Commission are able to review their proposed settlement and render their decisions, it would be premature to discuss the terms of the settlement any further. As you recall, Pennsylvania American Water's general rate case requested $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the 4-year period of 2019 through 2022. \n We also have pending rate cases in Missouri, Iowa, California and Virginia, and those cases are moving along on schedule.\n Also, in California, the California Public Utility Commission released the decision in September under its Low-income Ratepayer Assistance Program rulemaking. The decision will require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism, or WRAM, in its next general rate case filing in 2022, which will become effective in January 2024. California American Water has filed an application for a rehearing of the decision.  \n Finally, in September, and after careful consideration, California American Water withdrew a portion of its application at the California Coastal Commission for the Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project in an effort to further educate stakeholders on environmental and water supply benefits of the project. The company will be resubmitting its application in the near future, and once submitted, by statute, the California Coastal Commission would have 180 days to process after it deems the application complete.\n Lastly, regarding the sale of New York American Water. Last week, the governor announced proposed legislation that would include a PSC study of a public takeover option. We'll review the legislation when a bill is introduced. We still firmly believe the sale of New York American Water to Liberty is in the best interest of our customers, and we'll continue to take the needed steps to close the transaction in early 2021. \n Regarding state legislation. We've seen multiple states take action to help tackle water and wastewater challenges. In Indiana, legislation passed that authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case. And separate legislation passed that establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities to establish fair market value and a reasonable purchase price. Iowa amended legislation that gives the Iowa Utilities Board 180 days to approve acquisitions and allows systems to qualify as a distressed system when they don't have a certified operator. Virginia also signed its version of fair market value legislation into law this year, and West Virginia passed a bill that allows for expanded asset valuation, combined water and wastewater ratemaking and expansion of how municipalities can use proceeds from the sale of a water or wastewater system.\n Moving on to Slide 8. In addition to legislative action to help communities solve water and wastewater challenges, we believe our commitment to putting customers first is key to growing our regulated footprint. As I mentioned, so far in 2020, we've closed on 20 acquisitions in 9 different states, adding approximately 36,200 new customer connections. We've also added approximately 10,900 customer connections through organic growth through 9 months. We look forward to adding another 19,000 customer connections to currently sign agreements in 7 states. Also, the pipeline of opportunities we've noted are a result of increased conversations we're having across our footprint with communities looking for solutions to water and wastewater challenges. These opportunities are in various stages of development, and as you know, the process can take multiple years. \n We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now, and our mission is to help make those communities better because we're there. This includes our recent acquisitions of the city of Jerseyville water and wastewater system in Illinois and the Long Hill sewer system in New Jersey. According to the city of Jerseyville mayor, William Russell, \"We can trust that our water and wastewater systems are in professional, caring hands.\" \n Moving on to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make. This means smart investments, balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.2% compared to 34.8% for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2019. Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 317,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.9%. This is incredible work by our employees. \n Finally, before I turn the call over to Susan, I want to thank all American Water employees for their commitment to safety as we continue to provide essential services during this pandemic. I also want to send a special thanks to our employees in California, who once again, are safely and successfully providing critical water service as that state deals with catastrophic wildfires.\n And with that, let me turn it over to Susan. Yes. Thanks, Susan. Let me cover 2 more items before taking any of your questions. First, we plan to talk with you in February as we wrap up 2020 to discuss our 2021 earnings guidance and our long-term plan, including discussion on our ESG goals. In anticipation of that, you can expect that our plan of focusing on growth from infrastructure investment will continue. Additionally, we'll be meeting with many of you at the Virtual EEI Financial Conference next week. We look forward to talking with you all then. \n Second, as you all know, Veterans Day is next week. I'd like to take a moment to thank all the men and women who served and protected our country. As you may know, I graduated from West Point, was honored to serve as an army officer for more than 5 years. I'm proud to be a veteran and equally proud that American Water is a culture that reflects the support of our military. This year, we've been recognized by 2 veterans publications, U.S. Veterans Magazine and Military Times, receiving the honor as a top veteran-friendly company for having a top supplier diversity program and being among the top 100 Best for Vets Employers. And most recently, American Water received the highest recognition given by the U.S. government to employers, 2020 Secretary of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, for exemplary support of National Guard and Reserve employees. We're extremely proud of this recognition, and we'll continue to work with and support those who serve our country. \n With that, we're happy to take your questions. Well, let me take that, and Susan can jump in. But we don't break out the earnings from Military Services, we just do it on a segment basis for a number of reasons, but we just don't do that. But I can also talk to -- we're in 4 different solicitations right now, and we expect to hear back on 2 in the near term. So just a reminder, we won the last 3 major awards from the military, and we're really proud to be able to support the military and their families. No. No. I'm sorry, Ryan. We don't break that out like that. Yes. As I said in the remarks, Ryan, we still expect to close this in early 2021, and so we're working on an established time line. We're still confident that we can get there. Even as the governor has talked about proposed legislation, we don't think that would slow this down. Yes, it's a great question. And we're in many conversations with municipalities around the country. One of the reasons is the COVID impact, but still a lot of challenges around water and wastewater infrastructure, and we're a solutions provider. So we're going to continue to talk to municipalities about providing solutions. Our pipeline continues to grow, and we continue to talk to new municipalities. So we'll see where that takes us. Typically, it takes 2 to 5 years to complete these deals, so there is a delay from the time you start talking to them to the time you take ownership, but we're very confident in our ability to provide solutions for our communities. Yes. Let me start with the second question first. The acquisition adjustment will be dealt with separately. And the order -- there was an executive order that came out that said 90 days after the emergency orders lifted is when they have to render decision So we don't have an exact time on it yet, but we're expecting that after the executive -- after the emergency orders lifted. Yes. No, it's Indiana. There is an appraisal process, yes, for the nonmunicipal utilities and really around establishing fair market value and a reasonable purchase price. So yes, Indiana has been a leading state in legislation because they recognize, I think, the importance of what we can do as a company in addressing the water and wastewater challenges. So we're really proud to be working with Indiana legislature and coming up with bills that really affords us the opportunity to do that. 13.6%, yes. Yes. Thank you for joining our call today. We value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and the investment of our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team, they'll be happy to answer any questions you have. So again, thanks, again, and be safe, everyone."

            "name": "M. Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Walter, and good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 11 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. Third quarter 2020 consolidated earnings were $1.46 per share compared to $1.33 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned, included in earnings is an estimated $0.06 per share favorable weather impact. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.14 per share or an increase of 10.8% compared to 2019 earnings. The Market-Based Business results were flat to the prior year, and the parent company decreased $0.01 per share compared to the third quarter of 2019. \n Our 2020 earnings through September 30 were $3.11 per share or a 7.6% increase over the same period last year. Results for the 9-month period include an estimated $0.10 per share increase year-over-year from warmer and drier-than-normal weather in the third quarter of 2020 versus wetter-than-normal conditions in the second quarter of 2019. \n Also, for the year-to-date period, results reflect $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting and an estimated $0.02 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. \n Our Regulated Businesses increased $0.32 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share, and finally, the parent results decreased by $0.12 per share year-over-year, primarily due to higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business and the sale of a legacy investment in 2019.\n Moving to Slide 12. Let me walk through the third quarter results by business. The Regulated Operations increased $0.11 per share before considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic for the quarter. We saw a $0.16 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. As I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.06 per share increase from favorable weather in various parts of our service territory. O&M expense increased by $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.05 per share, net of the $0.01 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by assets held for sale accounting. \n The Market-Based Business third quarter results in 2020 were consistent with 2019, and the parent results decreased $0.01 per share, reflecting higher interest expense. \n And lastly, there was an estimated $0.03 per share favorable net impact from the COVID-19 pandemic as demand revenues in the regulated business improved, primarily in the residential customer class. During the quarter, we saw residential demand increase 13.6%. The increase reflects the impact of weather, normal changes in demand, growth and certainly the impact of more stay-at-home activities. Further, during the quarter, we saw commercial and industrial volumes improve to nearly flat year-over-year, reflective of what we expected, at least, a partial recovery as local communities began to reopen. Recall, we saw commercial volumes down 10.3% through the second quarter. \n In the third quarter, we have seen the impact of the pandemic on the Homeowner Services Group from delays in new partnerships and a launch of new products. And we started to see some recovery with 2 new partnership adds in the third quarter as companies are able to start to prioritize normal operations. And the ability to fully estimate the impact of the pandemic is challenging, as Walter said, but the anecdotal information from our state teams and our Market-Based Business team validates the trends we have seen in the third quarter.\n Moving to Slide 13. 9-month EPS increased 7.6% year-over-year. Regulated Operations increased $0.32 per share for the period, and we saw $0.48 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and an estimated $0.10 per share increase from weather year-over-year. O&M expense increased by $0.16 per share and depreciation increased $0.10 per share, net of the $0.04 per share for depreciation not recorded on assets held for sale. The Market-Based Businesses increased $0.04 per share due to Joint Base in San Antonio and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York going into full operation as of June 1, 2020, for military services as well as price increases and organic growth in Homeowner Services. Parent results decreased $0.12 per share, largely driven by $0.03 per share due to the sale of a legacy investment in 2019, and a $0.05 per share increase in interest expense. \n The estimated net impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is $0.02 per share unfavorable for the year-to-date period. As mentioned, in the regulated business, increased demand in the residential customer class has largely offset decreases in revenue from the commercial and industrial classes to date. Though the second quarter trend was a bit more negative, as we discussed, our initial intuition was that this offset would ultimately be the case. The unknown remains, though, as we -- as to how long and to what degree the pandemic continues. As we continue to watch these rate case-- these case rates increase in many of our territories, it's possible that additional restrictions are put in place that could, again, negatively impact demand for our commercial customers.\n Moving on to Slide 14. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. As of October 31, the Regulated Business received $127 million in annualized new revenues in 2020. This includes $57 million from rate cases, including step increases; and $70 million from infrastructure surcharges. Included in this number is the outcome from our most recent rate case in New Jersey, as Walter mentioned, at the start of the call. We have also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on the 5 rate cases previously discussed by Walter and 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $212 million. \n From a regulatory perspective, we are continuing to work diligently to address the impact of the pandemic in our service territories. As of today, we have commissioned orders, authorizing deferred accounting for COVID-19 financial impacts in 11 of our 14 jurisdictions, with 3 proceedings pending in Kentucky, Tennessee and New York. Essentially, all direct costs and foregone revenues are being captured for future recovery. Currently, the bottom line impact on the regulated business from the pandemic is the estimated variance in demand revenues, as we just discussed, and the minor impact on Homeowner Services.\n Moving on to Slide 15. As Walter said, we now expect our 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.87 per share to $3.93 per share, up from $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This guidance range reflects the favorable benefit of weather year-to-date and assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. It reflects an estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the assets held for sale accounting, and it also reflects an estimated $0.03 to $0.06 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. As we've said throughout this call, the full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors, which could include the length and severity of any impact on the demand for services and the nature and scope of any regulatory solutions.\n Finally, moving on to Slide 16. As Walter noted, the company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock in October. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the Board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last 5 years against the target of the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. \n As we've discussed all year, our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% now for the 12-month period ended September 30, 2020. Regulatory execution, along with the strong results from our Market-Based Businesses, allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We continue to believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations provides excellent value for our investors. The decades of investment need continues and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape, and as state and local communities continue to face added challenges from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. We see our business as resilient, and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like we are seeing with the current pandemic.\n And with that, let me turn the call back over to Walter for a few additional remarks. Yes. This is Susan. We have not changed our timing, and really, the timing that we have laid out in the plan -- and you're right, we had indicated in December, when we rolled out this current plan, that we had anticipated an issue somewhere in the middle of that 5-year period. That is still our current thinking. And it's really tied to when we need the proceeds, when we need some additional funding for the capital plan that we have laid out. As you recall, from December, we increased our capital expectation for the 5-year period and then obviously, rolled out our 10-year plan. And the equity issue we have in the current plan really supports the timing of when we think the investment occurs and when we really need the funding. And I just don't see any need to change that at this point. Yes. Our guidance overall, as we indicated, we've changed guidance this quarter, increased it. And included in that guidance range is an assumption of $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable for the year, and that really, I think, reflects our current trends. We saw a fairly substantial impact through the second quarter, and it's recovered some in the third as we saw the commercial business -- the commercial sector come back a bit, and the residential sector, again, continues to be pretty strong growth there. I think the challenge, of course, is to try to estimate how long this thing lasts and what the sort of new surge of cases may, in fact, do to businesses across our service territory, do they go into some additional phase of shutdown. So again, we've tried to capture some assumptions around that in our guidance range of the $0.03 to $0.06 unfavorable. Just difficult to predict, obviously, as we see this thing continue to unfold. And it is included in that guidance range that we established.\n I mentioned on the regulatory front, we now have deferral orders in 11 of the 14 jurisdictions, and that really does cover exposures to bad debt expense increases, direct costs associated with the pandemic, et cetera. So really, the impact that falls through, if you will, is just the demand revenue changes that we might see across the service territory. Everything else, the direct costs or direct impacts are captured in those deferral orders. It's disclosed in the Q. I think if you go to that footnote in the Q where we talk about COVID specifically, we've laid out the reg assets recorded, net of some reg liabilities. I don't have the number right in front of me, but it's laid out in the Q for you. Let me just quickly tag on to the question there. We do have a net regulatory asset of $26 million recorded at the end of September related to COVID. Jonathan, let me make sure I follow the question and maybe correct one thing. I think, at midpoint, we're up $0.06. We were roughly at $3.84 midpoint before, we're now at $3.90. And that really just was driven by the weather implications. That's the big driver of the of the change in midpoint, I would say. I think, we obviously did narrow the range a bit as we, again, have continued to see a little bit more recovery from the COVID costs than we had anticipated when we were discussing this with you at the second quarter. I recall then, our range was $0.05 to $0.08 unfavorable. We're now $0.03 to $0.06 is our current best guess at that. Obviously, the business continues to perform fundamentally very, very well. We've not seen any real slowdown in our investment opportunities. So the underlying business is performing very well. No, really no drivers of that nature. I mean, again, I think we're continuing to understand the impacts of COVID from a short-term and a long-term perspective. But as I said, the underlying business continues to perform quite well. There is always a number of gives and takes in any particular year, but we've not seen anything that's fundamentally changing our expectations about the ability for the business to perform. We're still looking at that, Jonathan. And I think you'll just have to wait till February, when we come out and give you sort of the full plan. I think, as Walter indicated in his remarks, though, you can expect to see a continued focus on investment in infrastructure. That's what drives this business, and we think we have great opportunity to continue to do that. I think we quoted that was up, Ed, you can check me 13%, I think, we said roughly 13% in the quarter, and again, we've laid out by quarter in the 10-Q. Yes, residential is up 13.6% in the quarter. It really did. And then commercial, again, we saw as -- on a year-to-date basis, is really flat to the prior year. So obviously, you would expect growth, right? But we think back flat to year-over-year is an indication that across much of our territory, which, again, we like the geographic diversity of our territory as this thing rolls through the country. Different parts of the country are responding differently in terms of business reopenings, and we've seen that occur through this third quarter."

I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s call, Ed Vallejo, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Vallejo, you may begin.\nEd Vallejo: Thank you, Gary, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us for today\u2019s call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will of course open the call for any of your questions. During this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. Now these statements are predictions based upon our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our June 30, 2020, Form 10-Q, each as filed with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information related to adjusted return on equity and our adjusted regulated O&M efficiency ratio can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide deck for this call.

All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. I should note that consistent with our efforts to ensure the safety and health of our team, we\u2019re again conducting this call, while practicing social distancing and from remote locations. As an example, Walter and Susan remain in separate locations. If for any reason technical issues do arise, Walter will take over and lead us through the full presentation. And with that, I will now turn the call over to American Water\u2019s President and CEO, Walter Lynch.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Ed. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. We have a lot to cover today and we thought it might be helpful to first address the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations and our estimates of the financial impact so far. As we've done since the onset of this health emergency, American Water continues to provide essential water and wastewater services to our customers and we know the critical role we play in helping our customers and communities through this pandemic. As we relayed on our first quarter call, we remain focused in three areas. The first is the care and safety of our employees and their families, the second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve, and the third is the execution of our preparedness plans. We can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through the pandemic. With recent surges of COVID-19 cases in many parts of our country, the measures we took early on remain in place while adding additional measures. These include employee health screenings prior to coming to work, social distancing, suspension of all non-emergency in-home appointments, limiting the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments and a required work-from-home policy for non-essential employees where possible. Because the number of cases varies across our footprint, we're taking into account CDC and local and state guidance as we work on plans to return to a more normal state of operation when possible with safety as the primary driver. As you know we were among the first utilities to suspend shutoffs and late fees prior to any orders being issued by states. We continue to work with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low income programs. Susan will cover this in greater detail, but we're working constructively with public service commission\u2019s as they look to address utility response measures, customer protections and cost recovery for regular utilities in their jurisdictions. Additionally, our liquidity and access to capital remained strong and we continue our disciplined approach to execute on our core strategies such as making needed capital investment. Finally, American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation continue to help the communities the we serve giving more than $400,000 in charitable contributions over the past three months to help mitigate impacts of COVID-19 in the communities we serve. Before I ask Susan to discuss the financial impacts of COVID-19 so far, I want to thank our employees not only for their tremendous effort throughout the pandemic, but also of what they've done all year to stay safe and provide essential service to the communities we serve. Now, let me turn the call over to Susan.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Walter, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly related to the impact of COVID-19 as many of our customers have been working from home and or sheltering in place because of the pandemic. Likewise, we have seen commercial and industrial demand weakened by about 13% and 7% respectively as our best estimate of the impact of COVID-19 over this period as many businesses have shuttered. And I'd simply remind you that we are about 70% residential on an annual revenue basis. As Walter mentioned, we discontinued service shutoffs that would normally occurred due to nonpayment and are no longer charging late fees. As a result, those revenue categories are also down. Also we have incurred some incremental operating costs to keep our employees and customers safe and have seen some increase in uncollectable accounts expense. The total estimated impact of the last demand, force of the last demand, foregone revenue and increased costs is estimated at about $21 million, which equates to about $15 million after tax or $0.09 per share before considering the accounting for future recovery. We've been working with regulators across our entire service territory alongside other utilities to address how these impacts the cost of service and recovery should be addressed. As a result of those discussions and regulatory orders received today at June 30, 2020, we have recorded a net regulatory asset of $12 million for future recovery which represents a significant portion of the total estimated impact. After considering the accounting for future recovery, the impact resulting from COVID-19 year-to-date is an estimated $0.05 per share in total. Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at some of the specific regulatory activities. As we said, we've been in discussions on behalf of our customers with public service commissions across our service area. Currently 10 of our 14 regulatory jurisdictions have issued orders to address the impacts of COVID-19 authorizing deferral of incremental cost and certain other financial impacts resulting from the implementation of moratorium on shutoffs and disconnections. Four states Missouri, New York, Tennessee and Kentucky have pending proceedings where we also expect to receive authority to capture the financial impacts of COVID-19. As a result of the orders received and expected actions by regulators as I mentioned we've recorded a $12 million - $12 million for future recovery, primarily related to foregone revenues from reconnect and late fees and estimated uncollectable accounts expense. Now as it relates to the demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base as I mentioned just a minute ago. As noted, our residential load is higher and our commercial and industrial loads have turned it down due to business closures. We estimate that the demand \u2013 the net demand loss directly related to COVID-19 to be approximately $10 million through June 30. This loss revenue is being tracked in each of our utilities. We believe that this lost demand relates directly to the pandemic and while we've conservatively not recorded a regulatory asset at the consolidated level for future recovery, we believe we have strong arguments and good opportunity to recover the lost revenue in our future COVID-19 or other filings. This lost revenue was essentially $0.04 per share of the total $0.05 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 in the quarter and year-to-date periods. We\u2019ll work diligently to seek recovery of these lost revenues as we think that makes more sense than making arbitrary cost reductions that could have longer term impacts on service delivery. As we think about the impact of COVID-19 our market based businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal subject to each instillations individual requirements. Our services are deemed essential, so we continue to deliver safe, clean and reliable water and essential wastewater services to our military base partners. For Homeowner Services, there has been some delay in new partner relationships and some delays in the launch of new products that we attribute directly to COVID-19 and the estimated impact of those delays is about $0.01 per share year-to-date. We believe we can maintain our customer base during this period of economic downturn because homeowners see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. And perhaps just a couple of final comments before I turn it back to Walter, we're executing our capital investment plan for the year and are looking for additional ways to assist communities needs as we go forward and we continue to remain confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.3 billion available at the end of June. And let me turn back to Walter for discussion of the remainder of the results for the quarter.\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Thanks, Susan. Let's move on to the second quarter and six month results as it's been an eventful year-to-date with several key rate cases, significant capital investment, multiple acquisitions and a sharp focus on business fundamentals. Through trying times once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthen our low risk profile and predictable growth story. Our second quarter 2020, GAAP earnings per share increases 3.2% compared to the second quarter 2019. Included in GAAP results are $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets out for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We invested capital of $930 million in the first half of 2020 which is a 17% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. We also continue to work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments like controlling O&M costs. We continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions. We've added more than 17,700 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 43,600 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2020. Our market-based businesses were up a $0.01 in earnings per share, reflecting year-to-date price increases in organic growth from Homeowner Services. We're also very honored to assume operations of Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in the second quarter of 2020. Moving to Slide 9, the foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable water and wastewater services to our customers. Our strategy remains consistent as we plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range and we expect our 2020 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. Susan will talk more about that in a few minutes. Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on July 29, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. Turning to Slide 10, let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the second quarter 2020. On June 30, Missouri American Water filed a rate request with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The case includes $920 million in water system improvements and $30 million in sewer system improvements from January 2018 to May 2022. This includes the replacement of approximately 275 miles of aging water and sewer pipes as well as the upgrading of treatment plants, storage tanks, wells and pumping stations across the state. The company's request is expected to take 11 months to complete and any new rates would not become effective until mid-2021. Pennsylvania American Water to file a general rate case in April requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the four year period of 2019 through 2022 including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes. Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to nine months and new rates would not be effective until 2021. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019 requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case we will have invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades in New Jersey. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017 and we expect a decision later this year. Now, let me turn to California where there's been quite a bit of activity California American Water waterfowl for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over three years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, we now expect the decision on this case in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. Also our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project is now scheduled to go before the California Coastal Commission for approval in mid-September. In early July, the California Public Utility Commission released a proposed decision on a low income rate payer assistance proceeding with the comment period currently underway and possible though in August. The decision would require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism known as RAM in its next general rate case filing in July 2022 becoming effective in January 2024. RAMs are mechanisms commonly used across utility sectors. They really have proven critical to promote conservation and infrastructure investment. From our experience, we believe the best way to address concerns with the impacts of RAMs is to improve forecasting in the rate making process. We're hopeful issues with the proposed decision will be resolved before the decision is voted on. If the proposed decision is adopted as is, California American water would consider options when they file their next rate case in 2022, which would affect rates starting in 2024. On the legislative front this year, I would highlight two bills that were signed by the governor of Indiana. The first one authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case and the second establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. Additionally, Missouri passed the Water Safety and Security Act which requires most water utilities with up to 30,000 customers to establish a cybersecurity plan and a valve and hydro inspection program. This is similar to legislation exists in Indiana and New Jersey. Finally, the sale of New York American Water continues to progress and we anticipate the closing of the acquisition by Liberty Utilities in early 2021. Moving on to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier in the first half of this year, we invested a total of $930 million with the majority in our regulated businesses including $881 million in infrastructure investment and $40 million in regulated acquisitions. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020 our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.3% compared to 35.2% for the 12 month period ended June 30, 2019. Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then we've added approximately 281,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.8%. We're very proud of our employees focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers especially given the current economic challenges some of our customers are facing. Moving on the Slide 12, we believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 13 acquisitions in six different states adding approximately 10,800 new customer connections. We've also added more than 6,900 customer connections to organic growth in the first six months. We look forward to adding another 43,600 customer connections to currently sign agreements in nine states, most of which we expect to close in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now and so we're pleased we\u2019re able to help. This includes our recent acquisition, the Village Of Shiloh wastewater system in Illinois. This is another example of acquiring the wastewater system in an area where we provide water services for decades. According to our village mayor [James Rainier], the sale of wastewater system to Illinois American Water \"allows the village to focus on other priorities.\" He also went on to say \"Illinois American Water is providing excellent water service to our residents for many decades. We look forward to expanding our partnership. \" We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 800,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, as many communities are seeking solutions to increase challenges which include regulatory, financial and those posed by COVID-19 in managing water and wastewater systems. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Susan.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks again, Walter. Let me start on Slide 14 with a bit more detail on results. Second quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.97 per share compared to $0.94 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned included in GAAP earnings is $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held-for-sale accounting and the estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.10 per share or an increase of 11.5% compared to 2019 earning. The Market-Based business results increased $0.01 per share and the parent company decreased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. Our 2020 GAAP earnings through June 30 were $1.65 per share or a 5.8% increase over the same period last year. And the six month period results include $0.03 related to depreciation not recorded assets held-for-sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Regulated Businesses increased to $0.18 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share primarily from Homeowner Services and finally the parent results decreased by $0.11 per share year-over-year. Moving to Slide 15, let me walk through the second quarter results by business. Regulated operations increased $0.14 per share before considering the $0.04 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Regulated Business. We saw a $0.20 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Walter mentioned as a reminder that 2019 results include $0.04 per share of unusually wet weather in the Regulated Business. O&M expense increased $0.05 per share and depreciation related to ongoing operations and $0.03 per share both to support Regulated acquisitions and other growth. The Market-Based Businesses second quarter results in 2020 increased $0.02 per share compared to 2019 before considering the $0.01 estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Market-Based businesses. The increase was driven primarily by Homeowner Services Group organic growth and contract price increases. Also during the second quarter, we are now fully operational on Joint Base San Antonio in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. The parent results decreased $0.08 per share with $0.02 per share reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business. The remaining $0.06 per share was the $0.03 per share sale of the legacy investment that occurred in 2019 and timing of expenses and other items that $0.03 per share. And finally on Slide 15, you'll see the total of $0.05 per share estimated impact from COVID as we discussed. Moving to Slide 16, six month GAAP EPS increased 5.8% year over year as I mentioned and many of the drivers on the variances in the quarter noted previously also explained year over year results. Moving to Slide 17, the regulated business has received $80 million in annualized new revenues in 2020 and this includes $18 million from step increases and $62 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on five rate cases as Walter just walk through and two infrastructure surcharge proceedings for total annualized revenue requests to $294 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. Moving onto Slide 18, the company expects its 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.79 per share to $3.89 per share on a GAAP basis. Included in this guidance range is the estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the accounted for assets held for sale and the estimated $0.05 to $0.08 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic the full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors which include the length and severity of decreased demand for services and the nature and scope of regulatory solution. Our current thoughts are that we start to see moderation in the impact on demand in the third quarter 2020. This guidance range is the same range that was previously announced on an adjusted basis. But let me be clear our 2020 expectation of result in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is unchanged from prior expectations. We continue to believe this range is reflective of the expected results on a normalized basis, normalized for the two unusual items in 2020 related to the depreciation issue and COVID-19. We think that guidance on GAAP results, which include these two items makes the message quite clear. And I also want to repeat what Walter said, we are affirming our long-term earnings compound annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next five years. Finally, moving on to Slide 19, as we noted in the release on July 29, 2020 the company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last five years and we expect to continue that growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.7% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our market-based businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our shareholders. To summarize, the decades of capital investment need continue and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape in the states and local communities continue to face added challenges from the impacts of COVID-19. We believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. The capital-light market-based businesses continue to improve customer experience and generate cash, and simply put our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments in the economy are being impacted by this health emergency, we see our business as resilient and we have built that in a way to endure these challenges. And with that, let me turn the call back to Walter for a few additional remarks.\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Thanks, Susan. I want to end by thanking American Water\u2019s employees for everything they have accomplished in the first half of this year, especially since the beginning of our response is the pandemic in March. With safety as our top priority, we've continued to provide essential services in every community we serve. Through American Water and the American Water charitable foundation, we support many organizations across our footprint and make a difference for the communities we serve, including those that seek to foster a more equitable society. And as we always have, we continue to support an inclusive and diverse culture in American Water. All these efforts are in addition to executing of our strategies, investing in our systems, bringing water and wastewater solutions to new customers and communities and becoming fully operational at two new military bases. While there may be significant concerns in the market given COVID-19 and a variety of other factors, I'm pleased to report that our fundamental story of American Water remains the same and our performance remains consistent because of the incredible employees who work here. With that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Angie Storozynski with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: So I have a question mostly about the guidance first. So just so unclear I mean on the GAAP level there is this positive offset through your - to the $0.05 hit from earnings. I mean \u2013 I am sorry from COVID related expenses. I don't have that benefit on an adjusted basis. So are you basically saying that even with that $0.05 hit I'm still within the adjusted EPS range or is there some other offset to that $0.05 hit on an adjusted basis?\nSusan Hardwick: Let me address that and I think you've mostly got it right. I think what we've continued to try to say here is that the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is what we believe to be expected results on a normalized basis. I think in the first quarter we called that adjusted because we were dealing with the depreciation issue in New York. Obviously the COVID estimates had not been fully vetted at that time. We now have a better insight as to what those COVID estimates are. But I think fundamentally, it's important to stay focused on that range of $3.79 to $3.89 which is where we believe we will end the year and whether you think about that as adjusted or as GAAP, I think it's important to note that's what we believe to be sort of normalized operations and that's what we've always said. We've gone to a GAAP guidance approach here, I think just to make it easier to understand and easier to follow what our guidance is. But there is no change from our expectation around sort of normalized results that range of $3.79 to $3.89.\nAngie Storozynski: And my second question on the New York. I appreciate Walter's comments that the sale transaction continues. It seems like at least based on press reports there are some attempts to municipalize part of this system of your New York system. So do you expect that the transaction gets delayed by those potential reviews, so and how should think about it?\nWalter Lynch: Okay. Thanks Angie. It\u2019s Walter, how are you? Let me start by saying we're moving forward with the sale of New York American Water. The regulatory approval process is progressing. There have been some delays related to giving third parties an opportunity to submit alternate proposals to the sale and we've taken that into account when we look at the - what we're saying as far as the beginning of 2021. So we don't anticipate any other delays because it's a very tight time frame that they've given these communities an opportunity to submit alternate proposals. One proposal has been received so far we\u2019re reviewing that, but Liberty and American Water committed to moving forward with the sale.\nAngie Storozynski: Awesome. And lastly, I mean we keep waiting to see the intervener\u2019s filings in your New Jersey rate case. I understand that they haven't been posted yet. So, can you give us at least a sense what are the key contentious points and how the rate case is going?\nWalter Lynch: Well, the rate case is proceeding according to our anticipated schedule. We - the postings have not been published so we really can't comment on those. But just to say there is really nothing out of the ordinary in these.\nOperator: The next question is from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: My first question just following up on Angie\u2019s questions on the guidance. I think, I understand that the moving pieces and longer term I do agree with the fact on an normalized basis that is what it is. But I guess just from apples-to-apples comparison versus the range that you have given out on adjusted basis as of first quarter. It seems like either the COVID expense impacts expectation is excluded from a \u2013 on apples-to-apples basis or with it you're essentially trending $0.05 to $0.08 below the original plan. You've talked about that you\u2019re confident I think getting a lot of that back on the disconnect costs and whatnot if those things do not materialize what type of cost measures do you have to potentially offset this or is it something that you're just going to hold back and to deal with it in 2021?\nSusan Hardwick: Walter, I can start there and you can certainly add.\nWalter Lynch: Okay.\nSusan Hardwick: I think as we again - we\u2019ll just talk about guidance for a second, a couple of thoughts I would give you relative to this maybe add to Angie\u2019s response. If we were continuing to provide adjusted guidance, we'll say using that terminology we would certainly look at these COVID costs as an item that we would adjust for. So, they would be considered part of that adjusted guidance just like we had done in New York. So, we would be adjusting for them and essentially saying they shouldn't be considered as part of normalized operations. And as we thought through that, we said it just makes more sense to go straight to GAAP guidance and say these are going to be the results on the books and they happen to be exactly the same guidance we've been providing all along on a normalized basis. Again, the $3.79 to $3.89, so we knew this is literally no change in guidance. So, again that's how we think about guidance. As it relates to sort of recovering, again we've got orders in 10 of 14 states and we\u2019ve got proceedings in the other four that we believe will allow us fully to seek recovery of all of the costs associated with COVID with the exception of the lost demand revenue, that is really the piece that ultimately falls through in that $0.05 the lost demand portions that are on the regulated side of the business. So, again we're going to continue to work with regulators on recovery of the lost demand dollars and again we think it makes sense to work through the regulatory process on recovery before we start to again sort of arbitrarily reduce costs that again can have longer-term impacts on our ability to continue to deliver services. We think this is an event that has occurred during this period. We're hoping that we start to see some moderation of that exposure in the third quarter as I mentioned. So we believe there is some isolation to it and we can again sort of work with regulators to seek recovery. And cost reductions, while we continue to focus heavily on them as we outlined here, we've made progress again on the O&M efficiency ratio and we continue to focus very heavily on cost and our cost structure in the business. We think that's where our focus should be and not on sort of arbitrary reductions that could potentially affect our ability to work or service.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And\u2026\nWalter Lynch: The only thing I\u2019d add to that, I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: My follow-up to this question was just going to be so when you do provide 2021 guidance, if there are any expectations of lingering COVID related impacts that will essentially be dogged out to provide more normalized GAAP guidance?\nSusan Hardwick: Well again I think we'll continue to talk about any impacts we see from COVID. I mean that's what I think we're trying to do here is simply highlight for you the significant issues that affect results and in this particular year it's the New York depreciation issue and it's COVID. To the extent we see lingering impacts into 2021, we'll continue to talk about the impact of COVID and make it very transparent to you what those impacts might be and how we're addressing them, whether they be from a regulatory perspective or some other. I'm not saying that we will adjust for them. Again I'm a bit of a purist as it relates to reporting, I think GAAP results are the best indicator of performance and so we think transparency around GAAP results is the right approach and that's what we're doing here.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. And just one follow-up if I may. I think there has been top from the campaign trail about increase clean energy plans and that's part of that just focus also on the water side and on water quality. How do you see that impacting or benefiting AWK from a rate base or having to manage expense - on an expense basis or is it still something that's more on a state-by-state basis that you\u2019re working on?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. It\u2019s really more in a state-by-state basis. We continue to talk to the folks on a federal level about the ways that private water - American Water can help resolve some of the issues and the challenges in the water and waste water space. But it's largely driven by the states.\nOperator: The next question is from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Reeder: I would just like to beat on that dead horse a little longer in terms of a cadence. But so you're kind of saying that the COVID impact\u2019s been $0.05 so far, if you're looking in your crystal ball for the second half of the year, there is the potential for an additional $0.03, does that what - how should we - we should view that $0.05 to $0.08 full-year impact of GAAP that you're talking about?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think that's fair Jonathan. Now as I said in the release and our remarks today, there is obviously a lot of unknowns and we will track this just like we do. It's a changing landscape every single day. But we have an expectation that the largest portion of the impact again this $0.05 or $0.04 on the regulated side is really driven by demand changes, and we expect that to start to moderate. Again, we've started to see employees return to work across our territory. We've seen industrial demand start to come back up. I think commercial is probably the biggest variable to be honest with you as you think about restaurants and some of the smaller commercial enterprises. They\u2019re likely going to have a little bit longer recovery period. So, I think that is the biggest variable. Our current view is that we'll see some of that moderation here in the third quarter. So that $0.05 to $0.08 range we've given around COVID really reflects that set of assumptions. That\u2019s for the balance of the year. Again, we should be able to sort of contain it within those that range, so that's our current thinking.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And for some reason you are successful getting regulators to support recovery of that lost revenue and that will represent essentially that $0.05 to $0.08 of upside to the GAAP.\nSusan Hardwick: Right Now, again - yes, as you think about how that process may play out though obviously we'll - we are working with regulations currently and we'll continue to do so. We'll have to work through a process to get those dollars reflected for recovery, so it may take a bit of time where there has been quick action by regulators to-date literally across the country as you know. The regulatory community has been very supportive of the process to identify a need for a solution here around particularly around disconnects and that sort of thing. The lost revenue piece is sort of another layer of challenge that we need to work through with regulators and that may take a bit of time. But yes, I mean if we can work through that, there is potential upside there. And as I mentioned in the script or in our prepared remarks, it may have been sort of a subtle comment, at the state level, we have recorded these lost revenues as recoverable items. We just took a conservative view with the parent and said we don't have regulatory orders in place to support it yet. So at the consolidated level, we did not record those regulatory assets. But we certainly expect to work through it with regulators and we'll see what progress we can make.\nJonathan Reeder: And then is the $12 million regulatory asset that has been recorded on the cost side, does that assume the other four states. I mean I know Missouri is the only kind of significant size one in there. But does that assume that those four also I guess approve the cost recovery at least to recover?\nSusan Hardwick: Well. Yes. We certainly have taken lots of guidance from our discussions with regulators in those states. We have had actually an ongoing conversation with them from the beginning. We certainly filed petition that would support that approach. We have lots of precedents obviously in our other 10 states as well as other states across the country. So again we're not trying to predict what regulators will do necessarily, but we certainly believe we've got good support for that approach and it is reflected in the accounting that we've done today.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And that\u2026\nWalter Lynch: Let me\u2026\nJonathan Reeder: I\u2019m sorry Walter, go ahead.\nWalter Lynch: No. Go ahead, go ahead Jon, then I\u2019ll jump in.\nJonathan Reeder: It\u2019s not. Go ahead by all means.\nWalter Lynch: Yes. I just want to emphasize that again we run this business for the long-term and we're going to continue to focus on those cost reductions that benefit our customers, our employees in the long-term. Its part of our culture we've been doing it for many years. We're going to continue to do it. You can see the O&M efficiency continues to improve and that's really important the way we run the business. So, I just wanted to emphasize that for this call.\nJonathan Reeder: Yes. That kind of actually squeezed into my thoughts. So, I mean I know you guys do run a very lean shop and everything, but your comments around kind of make an arbitrary cost reductions that could impact long-term quality versus other utilities out there that seemed to be finding these cost offsets, that they say won\u2019t impact service quality, is that just because you already feel like you run super lean where you don't have this low hanging fruit just to kind of offset the lost sales impact and therefore not have to go back to the world to ask customers to pick it up. You are already running super lean and that's why you feel like any additional cuts could impact the quality?\nWalter Lynch: Jon, I could only speak for our company, Jonathan, but we've been on this journey now for a dozen years focused on efficiencies and we're going to continue to do that, but again we're going to make the decisions in the context of what's right for our company, for our employees, for our customers and that's really what guides our decisions.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Jonathan.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Walter Lynch for any closing remarks.\nWalter Lynch: Well, thank you. I'm going to defer right now to Ed Vallejo. He has a few comments to make.\nEd Vallejo: Thanks, Walter. Well, as you all know, one of the ways American Water grows is by developing our employees and that's a great thing. So, now it's with mixed feelings today that I must share with you that Ralph Jedlicka, our IR Director for the last 3.5 years will be moving on to join our Treasury team to continue his development as a financial executive at American Water, and vice versa coming to us from the Treasury team, Mike Tavani will be joining the IR team. Mike is a CFA holder and he is experienced in Treasury at P&A and internal audit. You all will be meeting Mike virtually at least as we talk to you all over the next couple of weeks. So, Ralph, thank you for dedication and your sense of humor and most importantly for your counsel and friendship. Abbey, Kelley and I know that you'll be a great addition to the Treasury team. So, Godspeed as you continue your journey my friend. Walter?\nWalter Lynch: Okay. Thanks. Congratulations, Ralph and Mike. Okay. So, thank you for joining on our call today. We value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and in the investment in our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team. They'll be happy to answer them. Thanks again and be safe.\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending.

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks Walter, and good morning, everyone. Slide 6 summarizes the estimated impact of the pandemic on results through June 30, 2020. We've seen an estimated 5% increase in residential customer volumetric demand over this period that we think is directly related to the impact of COVID-19 as many of our customers have been working from home and or sheltering in place because of the pandemic. Likewise, we have seen commercial and industrial demand weakened by about 13% and 7% respectively as our best estimate of the impact of COVID-19 over this period as many businesses have shuttered. And I'd simply remind you that we are about 70% residential on an annual revenue basis. As Walter mentioned, we discontinued service shutoffs that would normally occurred due to nonpayment and are no longer charging late fees. As a result, those revenue categories are also down. Also we have incurred some incremental operating costs to keep our employees and customers safe and have seen some increase in uncollectable accounts expense. The total estimated impact of the last demand, force of the last demand, foregone revenue and increased costs is estimated at about $21 million, which equates to about $15 million after tax or $0.09 per share before considering the accounting for future recovery. We've been working with regulators across our entire service territory alongside other utilities to address how these impacts the cost of service and recovery should be addressed. As a result of those discussions and regulatory orders received today at June 30, 2020, we have recorded a net regulatory asset of $12 million for future recovery which represents a significant portion of the total estimated impact. After considering the accounting for future recovery, the impact resulting from COVID-19 year-to-date is an estimated $0.05 per share in total. Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at some of the specific regulatory activities. As we said, we've been in discussions on behalf of our customers with public service commissions across our service area. Currently 10 of our 14 regulatory jurisdictions have issued orders to address the impacts of COVID-19 authorizing deferral of incremental cost and certain other financial impacts resulting from the implementation of moratorium on shutoffs and disconnections. Four states Missouri, New York, Tennessee and Kentucky have pending proceedings where we also expect to receive authority to capture the financial impacts of COVID-19. As a result of the orders received and expected actions by regulators as I mentioned we've recorded a $12 million - $12 million for future recovery, primarily related to foregone revenues from reconnect and late fees and estimated uncollectable accounts expense. Now as it relates to the demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base as I mentioned just a minute ago. As noted, our residential load is higher and our commercial and industrial loads have turned it down due to business closures. We estimate that the demand \u2013 the net demand loss directly related to COVID-19 to be approximately $10 million through June 30. This loss revenue is being tracked in each of our utilities. We believe that this lost demand relates directly to the pandemic and while we've conservatively not recorded a regulatory asset at the consolidated level for future recovery, we believe we have strong arguments and good opportunity to recover the lost revenue in our future COVID-19 or other filings. This lost revenue was essentially $0.04 per share of the total $0.05 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 in the quarter and year-to-date periods. We'll work diligently to seek recovery of these lost revenues as we think that makes more sense than making arbitrary cost reductions that could have longer term impacts on service delivery. As we think about the impact of COVID-19 our market based businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal subject to each instillations individual requirements. Our services are deemed essential, so we continue to deliver safe, clean and reliable water and essential wastewater services to our military base partners. For Homeowner Services, there has been some delay in new partner relationships and some delays in the launch of new products that we attribute directly to COVID-19 and the estimated impact of those delays is about $0.01 per share year-to-date. We believe we can maintain our customer base during this period of economic downturn because homeowners see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. And perhaps just a couple of final comments before I turn it back to Walter, we're executing our capital investment plan for the year and are looking for additional ways to assist communities needs as we go forward and we continue to remain confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.3 billion available at the end of June. And let me turn back to Walter for discussion of the remainder of the results for the quarter. Thanks again, Walter. Let me start on Slide 14 with a bit more detail on results. Second quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.97 per share compared to $0.94 per share in 2019. As Walter mentioned included in GAAP earnings is $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets held-for-sale accounting and the estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. The Regulated Business segment results increased $0.10 per share or an increase of 11.5% compared to 2019 earning. The Market-Based business results increased $0.01 per share and the parent company decreased $0.08 per share compared to 2019. Our 2020 GAAP earnings through June 30 were $1.65 per share or a 5.8% increase over the same period last year. And the six month period results include $0.03 related to depreciation not recorded assets held-for-sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Our Regulated Businesses increased to $0.18 per share. Our Market-Based Businesses increased $0.02 per share primarily from Homeowner Services and finally the parent results decreased by $0.11 per share year-over-year. Moving to Slide 15, let me walk through the second quarter results by business. Regulated operations increased $0.14 per share before considering the $0.04 per share estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Regulated Business. We saw a $0.20 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investments, acquisitions and organic growth. Walter mentioned as a reminder that 2019 results include $0.04 per share of unusually wet weather in the Regulated Business. O&M expense increased $0.05 per share and depreciation related to ongoing operations and $0.03 per share both to support Regulated acquisitions and other growth. The Market-Based Businesses second quarter results in 2020 increased $0.02 per share compared to 2019 before considering the $0.01 estimated unfavorable impact from COVID-19 on the Market-Based businesses. The increase was driven primarily by Homeowner Services Group organic growth and contract price increases. Also during the second quarter, we are now fully operational on Joint Base San Antonio in the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. The parent results decreased $0.08 per share with $0.02 per share reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business. The remaining $0.06 per share was the $0.03 per share sale of the legacy investment that occurred in 2019 and timing of expenses and other items that $0.03 per share. And finally on Slide 15, you'll see the total of $0.05 per share estimated impact from COVID as we discussed. Moving to Slide 16, six month GAAP EPS increased 5.8% year over year as I mentioned and many of the drivers on the variances in the quarter noted previously also explained year over year results. Moving to Slide 17, the regulated business has received $80 million in annualized new revenues in 2020 and this includes $18 million from step increases and $62 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also filed requests and are awaiting final orders on five rate cases as Walter just walk through and two infrastructure surcharge proceedings for total annualized revenue requests to $294 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver financial results. Moving onto Slide 18, the company expects its 2020 earnings to be in the range of $3.79 per share to $3.89 per share on a GAAP basis. Included in this guidance range is the estimated $0.06 per share for depreciation not recorded as required by the accounted for assets held for sale and the estimated $0.05 to $0.08 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic the full year estimated impact of COVID-19 is highly dependent on the projected impact of a number of unknown factors which include the length and severity of decreased demand for services and the nature and scope of regulatory solution. Our current thoughts are that we start to see moderation in the impact on demand in the third quarter 2020. This guidance range is the same range that was previously announced on an adjusted basis. But let me be clear our 2020 expectation of result in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is unchanged from prior expectations. We continue to believe this range is reflective of the expected results on a normalized basis, normalized for the two unusual items in 2020 related to the depreciation issue and COVID-19. We think that guidance on GAAP results, which include these two items makes the message quite clear. And I also want to repeat what Walter said, we are affirming our long-term earnings compound annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis of a range of 7% to 10% while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next five years. Finally, moving on to Slide 19, as we noted in the release on July 29, 2020 the company's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. This reflects the continuation of the 10% increase in the annual dividend declared by the board on April 29, 2020. We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. We have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 10.1% over the last five years and we expect to continue that growth at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. Also we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.7% for the 12 months ended June 30, 2020. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our market-based businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations continue to provide excellent value for our shareholders. To summarize, the decades of capital investment need continue and drives our planned $20 billion to $22 billion of capital investment over the next 10 years. With the fragmented water and wastewater landscape in the states and local communities continue to face added challenges from the impacts of COVID-19. We believe we can provide those states and towns water and wastewater solutions to help mitigate those impacts. The capital-light market-based businesses continue to improve customer experience and generate cash, and simply put our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments in the economy are being impacted by this health emergency, we see our business as resilient and we have built that in a way to endure these challenges. And with that, let me turn the call back to Walter for a few additional remarks. Let me address that and I think you've mostly got it right. I think what we've continued to try to say here is that the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share is what we believe to be expected results on a normalized basis. I think in the first quarter we called that adjusted because we were dealing with the depreciation issue in New York. Obviously the COVID estimates had not been fully vetted at that time. We now have a better insight as to what those COVID estimates are. But I think fundamentally, it's important to stay focused on that range of $3.79 to $3.89 which is where we believe we will end the year and whether you think about that as adjusted or as GAAP, I think it's important to note that's what we believe to be sort of normalized operations and that's what we've always said. We've gone to a GAAP guidance approach here, I think just to make it easier to understand and easier to follow what our guidance is. But there is no change from our expectation around sort of normalized results that range of $3.79 to $3.89. Walter, I can start there and you can certainly add. I think as we again - we'll just talk about guidance for a second, a couple of thoughts I would give you relative to this maybe add to Angie's response. If we were continuing to provide adjusted guidance, we'll say using that terminology we would certainly look at these COVID costs as an item that we would adjust for. So, they would be considered part of that adjusted guidance just like we had done in New York. So, we would be adjusting for them and essentially saying they shouldn't be considered as part of normalized operations. And as we thought through that, we said it just makes more sense to go straight to GAAP guidance and say these are going to be the results on the books and they happen to be exactly the same guidance we've been providing all along on a normalized basis. Again, the $3.79 to $3.89, so we knew this is literally no change in guidance. So, again that's how we think about guidance. As it relates to sort of recovering, again we've got orders in 10 of 14 states and we've got proceedings in the other four that we believe will allow us fully to seek recovery of all of the costs associated with COVID with the exception of the lost demand revenue, that is really the piece that ultimately falls through in that $0.05 the lost demand portions that are on the regulated side of the business. So, again we're going to continue to work with regulators on recovery of the lost demand dollars and again we think it makes sense to work through the regulatory process on recovery before we start to again sort of arbitrarily reduce costs that again can have longer-term impacts on our ability to continue to deliver services. We think this is an event that has occurred during this period. We're hoping that we start to see some moderation of that exposure in the third quarter as I mentioned. So we believe there is some isolation to it and we can again sort of work with regulators to seek recovery. And cost reductions, while we continue to focus heavily on them as we outlined here, we've made progress again on the O&M efficiency ratio and we continue to focus very heavily on cost and our cost structure in the business. We think that's where our focus should be and not on sort of arbitrary reductions that could potentially affect our ability to work or service. Well again I think we'll continue to talk about any impacts we see from COVID. I mean that's what I think we're trying to do here is simply highlight for you the significant issues that affect results and in this particular year it's the New York depreciation issue and it's COVID. To the extent we see lingering impacts into 2021, we'll continue to talk about the impact of COVID and make it very transparent to you what those impacts might be and how we're addressing them, whether they be from a regulatory perspective or some other. I'm not saying that we will adjust for them. Again I'm a bit of a purist as it relates to reporting, I think GAAP results are the best indicator of performance and so we think transparency around GAAP results is the right approach and that's what we're doing here. Yes. I think that's fair Jonathan. Now as I said in the release and our remarks today, there is obviously a lot of unknowns and we will track this just like we do. It's a changing landscape every single day. But we have an expectation that the largest portion of the impact again this $0.05 or $0.04 on the regulated side is really driven by demand changes, and we expect that to start to moderate. Again, we've started to see employees return to work across our territory. We've seen industrial demand start to come back up.

So that $0.05 to $0.08 range we've given around COVID really reflects that set of assumptions. That's for the balance of the year. Again, we should be able to sort of contain it within those that range, so that's our current thinking. Right Now, again - yes, as you think about how that process may play out though obviously we'll - we are working with regulations currently and we'll continue to do so. We'll have to work through a process to get those dollars reflected for recovery, so it may take a bit of time where there has been quick action by regulators to-date literally across the country as you know.

            "name": "Walter Lynch",
            "content": "Thanks Ed. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. We have a lot to cover today and we thought it might be helpful to first address the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations and our estimates of the financial impact so far. As we've done since the onset of this health emergency, American Water continues to provide essential water and wastewater services to our customers and we know the critical role we play in helping our customers and communities through this pandemic. As we relayed on our first quarter call, we remain focused in three areas. The first is the care and safety of our employees and their families, the second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve, and the third is the execution of our preparedness plans. We can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through the pandemic. With recent surges of COVID-19 cases in many parts of our country, the measures we took early on remain in place while adding additional measures. These include employee health screenings prior to coming to work, social distancing, suspension of all non-emergency in-home appointments, limiting the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments and a required work-from-home policy for non-essential employees where possible. Because the number of cases varies across our footprint, we're taking into account CDC and local and state guidance as we work on plans to return to a more normal state of operation when possible with safety as the primary driver. As you know we were among the first utilities to suspend shutoffs and late fees prior to any orders being issued by states. We continue to work with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low income programs. Susan will cover this in greater detail, but we're working constructively with public service commission's as they look to address utility response measures, customer protections and cost recovery for regular utilities in their jurisdictions. Additionally, our liquidity and access to capital remained strong and we continue our disciplined approach to execute on our core strategies such as making needed capital investment. Finally, American Water and the American Water Charitable Foundation continue to help the communities the we serve giving more than $400,000 in charitable contributions over the past three months to help mitigate impacts of COVID-19 in the communities we serve. Before I ask Susan to discuss the financial impacts of COVID-19 so far, I want to thank our employees not only for their tremendous effort throughout the pandemic, but also of what they've done all year to stay safe and provide essential service to the communities we serve. Now, let me turn the call over to Susan. Yes. Thanks, Susan. Let's move on to the second quarter and six month results as it's been an eventful year-to-date with several key rate cases, significant capital investment, multiple acquisitions and a sharp focus on business fundamentals. Through trying times once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthen our low risk profile and predictable growth story. Our second quarter 2020, GAAP earnings per share increases 3.2% compared to the second quarter 2019. Included in GAAP results are $0.02 per share for depreciation not recorded due to assets out for sale and an estimated $0.05 per share unfavorable impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. We invested capital of $930 million in the first half of 2020 which is a 17% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last. We also continue to work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments like controlling O&M costs. We continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions. We've added more than 17,700 customer connections to date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 43,600 customer connections through pending acquisitions, most of which we expect to close in 2020. Our market-based businesses were up a $0.01 in earnings per share, reflecting year-to-date price increases in organic growth from Homeowner Services. We're also very honored to assume operations of Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in the second quarter of 2020. Moving to Slide 9, the foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable water and wastewater services to our customers. Our strategy remains consistent as we plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the United States. We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range and we expect our 2020 GAAP earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. Susan will talk more about that in a few minutes. Also consistent with our previous dividend guidance on July 29, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.55 per share of common stock payable on September 1, 2020. Turning to Slide 10, let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the second quarter 2020. On June 30, Missouri American Water filed a rate request with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The case includes $920 million in water system improvements and $30 million in sewer system improvements from January 2018 to May 2022. This includes the replacement of approximately 275 miles of aging water and sewer pipes as well as the upgrading of treatment plants, storage tanks, wells and pumping stations across the state. The company's request is expected to take 11 months to complete and any new rates would not become effective until mid-2021. Pennsylvania American Water to file a general rate case in April requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.6 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the four year period of 2019 through 2022 including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes. Traditionally, the Public Utility Commission's review of the filing may take up to nine months and new rates would not be effective until 2021. New Jersey American Water filed a general rate case in December 2019 requesting an overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case we will have invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades in New Jersey. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017 and we expect a decision later this year. Now, let me turn to California where there's been quite a bit of activity California American Water waterfowl for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over three years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, we now expect the decision on this case in the first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021. Also our Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project is now scheduled to go before the California Coastal Commission for approval in mid-September. In early July, the California Public Utility Commission released a proposed decision on a low income rate payer assistance proceeding with the comment period currently underway and possible though in August. The decision would require California American Water to file a proposal to alter its water revenue adjustment mechanism known as RAM in its next general rate case filing in July 2022 becoming effective in January 2024. RAMs are mechanisms commonly used across utility sectors. They really have proven critical to promote conservation and infrastructure investment. From our experience, we believe the best way to address concerns with the impacts of RAMs is to improve forecasting in the rate making process. We're hopeful issues with the proposed decision will be resolved before the decision is voted on. If the proposed decision is adopted as is, California American water would consider options when they file their next rate case in 2022, which would affect rates starting in 2024. On the legislative front this year, I would highlight two bills that were signed by the governor of Indiana. The first one authorizes recovery for aboveground infrastructure without a full rate case and the second establishes an appraisal process for non-municipal utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. Additionally, Missouri passed the Water Safety and Security Act which requires most water utilities with up to 30,000 customers to establish a cybersecurity plan and a valve and hydro inspection program. This is similar to legislation exists in Indiana and New Jersey. Finally, the sale of New York American Water continues to progress and we anticipate the closing of the acquisition by Liberty Utilities in early 2021. Moving on to Slide 11. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier in the first half of this year, we invested a total of $930 million with the majority in our regulated businesses including $881 million in infrastructure investment and $40 million in regulated acquisitions. As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12 month period ending June 30, 2020 our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.3% compared to 35.2% for the 12 month period ended June 30, 2019. Our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then we've added approximately 281,000 customer connections while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.8%. We're very proud of our employees focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers especially given the current economic challenges some of our customers are facing. Moving on the Slide 12, we believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on 13 acquisitions in six different states adding approximately 10,800 new customer connections. We've also added more than 6,900 customer connections to organic growth in the first six months. We look forward to adding another 43,600 customer connections to currently sign agreements in nine states, most of which we expect to close in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint. We know that many communities are facing unprecedented challenges now and so we're pleased we're able to help. This includes our recent acquisition, the Village Of Shiloh wastewater system in Illinois. This is another example of acquiring the wastewater system in an area where we provide water services for decades. According to our village mayor [James Rainier], the sale of wastewater system to Illinois American Water \"allows the village to focus on other priorities.\" He also went on to say \"Illinois American Water is providing excellent water service to our residents for many decades. We look forward to expanding our partnership. \" We're very disciplined in our approach to acquisitions leveraging our tremendous expertise to find solutions for communities. We now have about 800,000 customer opportunities in our pipeline, as many communities are seeking solutions to increase challenges which include regulatory, financial and those posed by COVID-19 in managing water and wastewater systems. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Susan. Yes. Thanks, Susan. I want to end by thanking American Water's employees for everything they have accomplished in the first half of this year, especially since the beginning of our response is the pandemic in March. With safety as our top priority, we've continued to provide essential services in every community we serve. Through American Water and the American Water charitable foundation, we support many organizations across our footprint and make a difference for the communities we serve, including those that seek to foster a more equitable society. And as we always have, we continue to support an inclusive and diverse culture in American Water. All these efforts are in addition to executing of our strategies, investing in our systems, bringing water and wastewater solutions to new customers and communities and becoming fully operational at two new military bases. While there may be significant concerns in the market given COVID-19 and a variety of other factors, I'm pleased to report that our fundamental story of American Water remains the same and our performance remains consistent because of the incredible employees who work here. With that, we're happy to take your questions. Okay. Thanks Angie. It's Walter, how are you? Let me start by saying we're moving forward with the sale of New York American Water. The regulatory approval process is progressing. There have been some delays related to giving third parties an opportunity to submit alternate proposals to the sale and we've taken that into account when we look at the - what we're saying as far as the beginning of 2021. So we don't anticipate any other delays because it's a very tight time frame that they've given these communities an opportunity to submit alternate proposals. One proposal has been received so far we're reviewing that, but Liberty and American Water committed to moving forward with the sale. Well, the rate case is proceeding according to our anticipated schedule. We - the postings have not been published so we really can't comment on those. But just to say there is really nothing out of the ordinary in these. Okay. The only thing I'd add to that, I'm sorry, go ahead. Yes. It's really more in a state-by-state basis. We continue to talk to the folks on a federal level about the ways that private water - American Water can help resolve some of the issues and the challenges in the water and waste water space. But it's largely driven by the states. Let me... No. Go ahead, go ahead Jon, then I'll jump in. Yes. I just want to emphasize that again we run this business for the long-term and we're going to continue to focus on those cost reductions that benefit our customers, our employees in the long-term. Its part of our culture we've been doing it for many years. We're going to continue to do it. You can see the O&M efficiency continues to improve and that's really important the way we run the business. So, I just wanted to emphasize that for this call. Jon, I could only speak for our company, Jonathan, but we've been on this journey now for a dozen years focused on efficiencies and we're going to continue to do that, but again we're going to make the decisions in the context of what's right for our company, for our employees, for our customers and that's really what guides our decisions. Thanks. Well, thank you. I'm going to defer right now to Ed Vallejo. He has a few comments to make. Okay. Thanks. Congratulations, Ralph and Mike. Okay. So, thank you for joining on our call today. We value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and in the investment in our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team. They'll be happy to answer them. Thanks again and be safe."

All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share.I should also note that consistent with our efforts to ensure the safety and health of our team, we're conducting this call while practicing social distancing and from remote locations. As an example, Walter and Susan are in separate locations. We don't anticipate any technical issues. But if for any reason technical issues do arise, Walter will take over and lead us through the full presentation.That being said, I will now turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Walter Lynch.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll start by giving you a brief update on our COVID-19 response and then provide key updates on our business. Susan Hardwick, our CFO, will cover the first quarter financial results and provide a few additional comments related to the implications of COVID-19. As you know, American Water provides clean, safe, reliable water and wastewater services and is continuing to do so throughout this pandemic. American Water\u2019s established clear priorities across our organization, focused in three areas; the first is the care and safety of our employees and their families; the second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve; and the third area of focus is the execution of our preparedness plans, so we can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through this crisis.Let me give some examples that the measures we've implemented. Because safety is our top priority, we've implemented required work from home policy where possible, as well as social distancing and other enhanced safety measures for employees and customers. For example, we've suspended all nonemergency and home appointments and limited the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments. We've also worked hand in hand with labor across the business and supported our employees with paid leave for COVID-19 diagnosis, quarantines and childcare.We suspended billing related service shut offs, suspended late fees and have restored service to customers who were previously shut off for nonpayment. We're also working with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low income programs. Susan will cover this a bit more later, but we've implemented actions to strengthen our liquidity and ensure access to capital. We also continue to execute on our core strategies, such as making needed capital investment. We've increased communications with public service commissions, customers and public officials. As the COVID-19 impact continues to be assessed, American Water will work constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protection and cost recovery for all regulated utilities in their jurisdictions.Finally, we provided $500,000 donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation to help fund COVID-19 relief efforts across the United States. This was in addition to $100,000 donation made to feeding America to help support food banks. We understand we have a very important role during this crisis. We provide water and wastewater services for hygiene, hospitals, sanitation and fire protection. We thank all our employees for continuing to provide these essential services.Moving on to first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low risk profile and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share increased 9.8% compared to first quarter 2019. We invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is 36% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve, along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last.As you know, we work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M costs. I'll talk more in a moment about our regulated operations, our continuing progress in regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. Our market based businesses were up a penny in earnings per share. This was due primarily to growth in customer contracts from homeowner services. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, our military services group was awarded two military contracts, Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. We're on track to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020.Moving to Slide 7, the foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. We believe that long-term financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services, and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country.We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. We also expect our 2020 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This is the same range we communicated in February, which should have been identified as an adjusted EPS range. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. In her comments, Susan will provide additional information about the difference between our GAAP and adjusted guidance ranges.Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on April 29th, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.50 per share to $0.55 per share, a 10% increase. We understand that a secure and growing dividend is important to our shareholders, while striking the right balance with continued investment in our regulated operations.Turning to Slide 8. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the first quarter of 2020. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case last week, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.64 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the four year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes.The case also includes enhancements to our Customer Assistance Program. Traditionally, the public utility commission's review of the filing may take up to nine months, and new rates would not be effective until 2021. Also, in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved the company's revision to its wastewater DSIC. This action allows the DSIC to be applied to another 50 thousand wastewater customers effective May 1st. We also have three pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California.New Jersey American Water filed the general rate case in December 2019, requesting in overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we've invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019 and we expect the decision later this year.Moving West, California America Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over three years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, the evidentiary hearings were moved from April and May to early June with final hearing dates expected in late August. We now expect the decision on this case as early as first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021.On the legislative front, during the quarter, Indiana Governor Holcomb signed two bills; the first one authorizes recovery for above ground infrastructure without a full rate case; and the second establishes an appraisal process for non-ministry utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. In West Virginia, Governor Justice signed a water and wastewater investment and Infrastructure Improvement Act. Effective June 5th, this legislation creates a voluntary process to use fair value assessments to determine the value of the water or wastewater systems, enables combined water and wastewater rate making and expands how municipalities can use the proceeds they receive from selling utility assets to better address needs in their communities.Finally, in Virginia, Governor Northam signed fair market value legislation, which will go into effect on July 1st. This is now the ninth state that has adopted fair market value legislation across our footprint. All this legislation is focused on helping communities and utilities address water and wastewater challenges.Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter we invested $457 million with the majority in our regulated businesses, including $432 million in infrastructure investment and $21 million in regulated acquisitions.As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12 month period ended March 31, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% compared to 35.5% for the 12 month period ended March 31, 2019.Now, to put this into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 276,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.7%. We're very proud of our employees\u2019 focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current situation and economic challenges some of our customers are now facing.Moving on to Slide 10. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on five acquisitions in four different states, adding about 6,200 new customer connections. We've also added more than 3,200 customer connections through organic growth in the first quarter. We look forward to adding another 45,800 customer connections through currently signed agreements in eight states, most of which we expect to close this year in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint.And with that, let me now turn it over to Susan.\nSusan Hardwick: Thank you, Walter and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, GAAP earnings were adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recorded in the quarter related to the New York subsidiary assets, had they not been classified for accounting purposes as assets held for sale. Also, 2019 GAAP earnings were adjusted for a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.Excluding these two adjustments, earnings per share as adjusted increased $0.06 per share or 9.8%, driven primarily by growth in the regulated business. The regulated business segment results increased $0.08 per share or an increase of 13.6% compared to 2019 earnings. The market based business results increased a penny per share and the parent company decreased $0.03 per share compared to 2019, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business.Moving on to Slide 13. Regulated operations increased $0.08 per share in total. We saw $0.14 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. O&M expense increased $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.03 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and growth. Also, results reflected $0.03 per share benefit primarily related to lower pension expense from a higher assumed return on assets used to set expense for 2020.The market based business\u2019s first quarter results increase compared to 2019, primarily by the homeowner services group\u2019s organic growth and contract price increase. Also, as Walter already mentioned, we expect Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020. And finally, the parent results decreased $0.03 per share, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.Moving on to Slide 14. The regulated businesses received $53 million in annualized new revenue in 2020, and this includes $18 million from step increases and $35 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also found requests and are waiting final orders on the four rate cases and three infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $224 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver on these financial results.And before I wrap up on Slide 15, let me add a few additional thoughts related to the expected implications of COVID-19. First, as it relates to demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base, residential revenues, including bulk sales are about 69%. Commercial is 21%, mostly in the food and beverage sector and industrial is only 4% of our total revenue. Our very early indications are that our residential load is higher and our commercial and industrial loads are trending down as businesses closed and certain other slowdowns occur.Disconnections in late fees have been suspended and disconnection notices have stopped, as Walter mentioned earlier. We've also reconnected customers previously disconnected for nonpayment and suspended reconnection fees. This is critical to our customers as they work through this difficult situation and we currently don't expect the impact of this temporary measure to be material.It's too early to tell how customers\u2019 overall ability to pay will be impacted by COVID-19, so estimated uncollectible accounts exposure to this risk is not yet possible. As is evidenced by regulatory actions across the country to-date, we expect issues like this will be addressed timely and certainly, in future rate cases at the very least. We will work closely with regulators in our jurisdictions on how the cost of this pandemic will be treated for recovery purposes.As Walter mentioned, we invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020 to better serve our customers. At this point, we believe our regularly scheduled capital projects will continue as planned, perhaps with some slowdowns that could be made up later in the year. So I don't believe we'll have any adjustments to our 2020 CapEx levels at this time.We continue to monitor our key suppliers and today have had no major disruptions to our supply chain. Our key distributors are reporting an excess inventory in materials like pipes, valves, hydrants, couplings and our chemical providers are meeting our needs and are reporting those shortages as of this point.As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our market based businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal, subject to each installation\u2019s individual requirements. As you know, our services are deemed essential so we continue to do what the Department of Defense has hired us to do, which is to deliver safe, clean and reliable water to our military base partners.For homeowner services, while development of new partner relationships maybe delayed somewhat, we believe we can maintain our customer base during periods of economic downturn. And that homeowners really do see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. And perhaps maybe one final comment before I talk about how we've addressed liquidity. I simply mentioned that our pension plans were funded at just over 80% as of year-end 2019. And though there's been much volatility in the equity markets, as you all know, I\u2019d remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2020.Moving to Slide 16, as it relates to liquidity. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the debt capital markets. And like many others, we experienced some constraints in the commercial paper market and we have now seen a general loosening in that area. We've been focused on liquidity since this situation really accelerated. In addition to our existing $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that supports working capital needs and capital spending, on March the 20th, we entered into $750 million 364 day term loan at a very favorable rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points. We have drawn on that term loan at $500 million and we\u2019re holding that amount in cash currently.As part of our planned financing for 2020, we executed on the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt on April 14th. The issue consisted of $500 million in 2.8% coupon senior notes due 2030 and $500 million and 3.45% coupon senior notes due 2050. The proceeds from the long-term debt issuance were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and outstanding draws against our revolving credit facility. We're confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.8 billion available at the end of April.Moving on to Slide 17, let me summarize now. As Walter said, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share, which is consistent with the guidance range we last announced in February 2020, and which should have been identified as an adjusted guidance range at that time.Our 2020 GAAP earnings guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95 per share. The difference of $0.06 relates to the expected annual depreciation on the New York subsidiary assets, which have been presented as assets held for sale. With the accounting treatment of assets held for sale, GAAP requires a depreciation [fees] on those assets. And the only adjustment currently anticipated between our expected GAAP results and our expected adjusted earnings per share results is that $0.06 of depreciation expense. We've reflected $0.01 per share of that in first quarter reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.As Walter also mentioned, we are affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis in the range of 7% to 10%, while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next five years. The decades of capital investment needs continue and drives are $20 billion to $22 billion of investment over the next 10 years. The fragmented water and wastewater landscape continues to provide what we see as a growing pipeline for acquisition.The capital light market based businesses continue to increase customer experience and generate cash. And simply put, our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this crisis, we see our business as quite resilient and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like this.Finally, moving on to Slide 18. We're working through these very different and turbulent times, we continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our market based businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continue to provide excellent value for our investors.We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. With our announced increase in dividend of 10%, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last five years, and we expect to continue that growth well into the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings.And with that, let me simply turn it back to Walter for a few additional remarks.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks, Susan. It's been a month since I've had the honor of leading this company as CEO. I want to take a moment to thank all the employees of American Water. Their response to the current health crisis has been simply incredible. Not only are we providing essential services while keeping safety as our top priority, we've invested in water and wastewater systems, welcome new customers who close acquisitions and work with state leaders, regulators and other key officials.We've also had a significant increase in customer satisfaction. We've achieved all this since the beginning of the year. Our company will emerge strong from this COVID-19 pandemic. How we work together throughout this crisis will have a lasting positive impact on our culture of trust and teamwork. I personally can't wait to once again get out to our business, to our plants, to our operating centers, to our call centers and say thanks to our employees. They're simply the best.And with that, we're happy to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Maybe appreciate all the color, just any quantifiable trends, I know it's early on the regulated side in terms of, you mentioned residential demand being higher and commercial industrial perhaps slower. But any quantifiable trends into April and in your regulated subsidiaries? And then also, are you seeing any nonpayments or no payments in your market based businesses? I know it's early on, but anyhow you could provide I\u2019d appreciate it.\nWalter Lynch: Susan, you want to take that and then I'll jump in at the end.\nSusan Hardwick: Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early. And as we think about across all of our jurisdictions the various states implemented restrictions and stay at home orders at different times. So obviously, depending on when that occurred in each of our jurisdictions that's going to impact when we really started to see a shift in demand expectations. I\u2019d again reiterate what I said in our prepared remarks, roughly 70% of our load is residential and as you can imagine, obviously, folks are at home. So we are seeing in our early data that residential sales are up.And again, I\u2019d hesitate to quantify it because it's still so early. In some cases, we may have six weeks worth of demand data. In other cases, we may only have three or four weeks, again, depending on when those measures were put in place. And in some cases, we have real time meters, some cases we don't. So we have to wait until we have actual billing data. But we certainly are seeing residential usage up.On the commercial side, again, it depends on the jurisdiction and depends on the mix of customers in a particular state. But as you can imagine, commercial is trending down, because of business closures, restaurant closing et cetera. And on the industrial side, while in a particular state it could be a material change. And I'll give an example in Kentucky, we've got a large plant there an auto manufacturer. So in the State of Kentucky, we're seeing a pretty substantial decline in industrial sales, because of the concentration there. But overall, our industrial sales makeup is only about 4% of our total.So again, as you sort of roll all that together, residential is up, the other two are down. Our current thinking is that they may tend to offset each other. But I think it also depends on how long this goes. It depends on sort of a variety of factors in each of the jurisdictions. So, again, I'm not getting directly to your quantify it but hopefully, a bit more color there is helpful. On the collection side, again, I'd say it's too early to really see much on the regulated side and we certainly haven't seen anything on the market base side either that gives us immediate concern about collection. On the market based side in particular, I don't think we expect much in the way of difficulties there.Again, we think customers appreciate and are willing to sort of stay with these programs, because it helps them avoid unexpected future expenditures. So we're quite confident we'll be able to retain customers, and with that goes the ability to collect on the fees under those contracts.\nWalter Lynch: And I think the key to the usage, again, back to what Susan was talking about is when do these states get back to normal, when do they start opening up. A lot of the commercial establishments and industrial and obviously, we're tracking that very closely as we work with the governor's offices and our plants and working with them.\nDurgesh Chopra: And then maybe just real data from the timing of the New York American Water sale. Is that still expected to close? I believe it was late this year. Is that still on track?\nWalter Lynch: Yes, we're still moving forward with the sale. There's no delay in the regulatory process. And we're working very well with Liberty and we expected to closing that late this year or early in 2021, Durgesh .\nDurgesh Chopra: And then just final one for me, I apologize. In terms of just, some of your peers have talked O&M savings, Walter and Susan, just folks staying on home, less mileage expense. That's expenses in general travel, meals, et cetera. Are you seeing that? And sort of what was the experience, I guess, maybe it's still early to talk about. But any color into what you might have seen versus original plan year-to-date in terms of those expense savings?\nWalter Lynch: Well, let me start and then I'll hand it off to Susan. Durgesh, as you know, in my prepared remarks in over the years we focused very closely on O&M expenses. And so that's part of our culture. We're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to drive O&M expenses down. So that when we invest, we're asking our customers to pay for that investment and not the O&M cost. So again, it\u2019s part of our culture, we just -- it\u2019s embedded, everybody understands it. And that's, again, the continued focus that we're going to have in this business, not just during the pandemic, as you know. So I'll ask Susan for additional comments.\nSusan Hardwick: I think, Walter, you're right on target. The only thing I would add, maybe just as a specific example and you mentioned travel one, obviously, we've implemented no travel across all of our jurisdictions. But what you might not be thinking about is added PPE that we've added for all of our employees, including office employees. So there's added expense there, while we may have saved in other areas. So, the bigger picture is we are still on target for our earnings expectations for the year, and I think our ability to navigate all the variables. And the result as our expectations remain the same, I think that gives a pretty good indication of how we're managing.\nOperator: Now our next question will come from Richard Verdi with Coker and Palmer.\nRichard Verdi: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking my call. And Walter, I just wanted to say congrats on your first call as CEO of the company. It was great so far. I just wanted to start very quickly with the military operation. Typically, its turnaround on new contracts can take 12 to 18 months and it's the same with your peers obviously. And so it just seems kind of quick of a turnaround that we're going to start to see work being done here in the second quarter of 2020. And I was just wondering if you talk a little bit about what made that turnaround so quick, and when we could start to maybe see positive impact on the financials from such turnaround?\nWalter Lynch: On our two new bases, we've been in transition services since we got the award. And we worked very well at both installations with Joint Base San Antonio and West Point, showing the value to the communities. And we're going to be starting full operations, as I said in my prepared remarks in the second quarter. So, I think it's the trust and confidence that they have in our military services group to take over their water and wastewater systems and do it in a professional and amazing way as our group does with our military services group.So again, we're really proud to have those two new installations, particularly West Point, one of the most important military installations in the country. I'm a graduate of West Point [Multiple Speakers] I\u2019d like to say that. But no, we're really proud of our military services group. They've developed a tremendous reputation and brand with the government. And I think it\u2019s the confidence that they have in our group that's move those forward as quickly as we have.\nRichard Verdi: And then kind of follow-up to that. What sort of indication has the company received on potential delays in new rewards, and new bases being awarded because of the COVID crisis? Has there any at all or what's kind of going on in there?\nWalter Lynch: So we're in five active solicitations right now. And we expect still this year to hear on three of those. So we're not seeing any measurable delay on behalf of the government and moving those forward.\nRichard Verdi: And then for the municipal acquisition front, do you think that COVID could cause, I mean what's the feeling internally there where COVID causes municipalities to somewhat become cash straps and maybe accelerate the sales of their water systems to American Water?\nWalter Lynch: Well, we believe looking at the impact of COVID-19 crisis we're going to have on communities that there are going to be a lot of municipalities that are facing financial challenges. And so when you look at what the efforts that we've put in already over the years of building our pipeline. And again our pipeline is 650,000 customer connections. We've worked on fair market value legislation, we've worked on water quality accountability legislation. And when you really add this COVID-19 crisis and we think it will have an impact on the number of communities that we're having discussions with, so being able to show what we can do and providing solutions for them. We do think it's going to have an impact on those discussions, absolutely.\nRichard Verdi: And then just the last question here, thank you for the time. When you look at the guidance for the year of 3.79 to 3.89, and you look into the model, and you also think back to the Analyst Day, of how the company now intends to issue equity at some point over the next five years. Debt to capital is targeted to come down to 59% to 60% range over time, and then we have a CapEx plan and then there's also COVID. At least in my model, when you start to bring down diluted earnings per share below that 3.79 figure into low 3.70s, the flow through impact of that is that your operating cash drops. And you either need to make up for that by issuing debt, which will increase your debt to total capital before you issue more equity, which could possibly dilute the EPS growth rate or you peel back on CapEx. And no one knows what -- you guys are doing a great job obviously so far, but no one knows. If you go on for a long time, it could be really unfavorable. So let's just assume a doomsday scenario. What would be the for -- where would the company look to try to remedy the situation, but also try to keep the long-term growth guidance in range? Does the company say okay, we're going to let our debt ratios maybe kind of at risk and further credit downgrades, do we issue more equity, do we peel back CapEx. I'm sure you guys have kind of ran scenarios internally there. What's kind of a doomsday scenario, what would be a strategy that occurred?\nWalter Lynch: Susan, you want to take that one?\nSusan Hardwick: Rich, there's a lot in that question, obviously. And I'd start with just simply saying that where we are today, we are confident in our ability to hit all of the various targets we've laid out. And I think we said that sort of throughout our remarks. We like I'm sure everyone has done a variety of scenarios and in sort of worst case, best case types of analyses. And that's just good financial planning. I would say to you that as you outline them in all of your remarks, we would have many levers to pull. And I'm probably not going to comment beyond that.I just think the strength of the balance sheet and the strength of our credit, the diversity of our operations, there's a whole variety of things about our business model that are set up in a way that makes it possible for us to navigate through situations like this. I made the comment in my remarks that, again, we're built on fundamentals, and we believe this is a very resilient business and I believe that's absolutely true. So to the extent we've got to look at different approaches to manage whatever crises come along, I'm confident in our ability to do so.\nRichard Verdi: And I just actually have one more question, I'll wrap it up with this. Can you guys just refresh my memory again, please with the 3.79 to 3.89 guidance, assuming that was created around a magic number of an expectation of 3.84 for the end of the year, the midpoint of the guidance. What must happen from that 3.84 for actually 3.79 to be reportable? What would need to happen to have that low end of the guidance to be reported?\nWalter Lynch: Susan, you want to take that -- I mean, mostly it\u2019s weather impact, as you know\u2026\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, that's all I would say. Yes, I just think just variables like that, that are beyond our control. And that's why we give a range to be able to account for things like that. I think weather would be the largest potential impact.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo.\nJonathan Reeder: Good morning, Walter and Susan. Hope you're having a good day morning. It was nice for Susan to step aside right when a pandemic was coming down the pike towards your, right? I know you just, you expect constructive treatment. But have any of your largest states, like PA or New Jersey, Missouri, Illinois, taking concrete action with respect to [Technical Difficulty] recovery of incremental COVID-19 costs?\nSusan Hardwick: And I'm going to get to sort of an analysis here we've done. We've actually obviously been active with regulators across all the jurisdictions, monitoring their actions and then we certainly developed our own strategy on how we would approach. But we know for certain that California, Maryland, Virginia, have addressed. They've already issued orders on cost deferrals. We have pending proceedings in Illinois and Iowa to do similarly. And we have discussions ongoing in every state but Hawaii, it was just it\u2019s easier and probably say the ones that we don't have. So active discussions or actions already taken across our jurisdictions.\nJonathan Reeder: And then Walter, can you maybe talk about the calculus on year-end, as well as the feedback in the states where you have major requests pending. I think you're planning on filing another major rate case yet this year in, I guess it\u2019s Missouri or Illinois. But any apprehension with being in for rates of many customers are facing these economic hardships. You've seen some companies kind of defer filing requests or extend out the timeline, stuff like that. But it sounds like for you guys, it's kind of full steam ahead in some regards?\nWalter Lynch: Jonathan, let me say first that we're very sensitive to the situation that our customers are facing right now. We've been investing as you know, significant amounts in our systems. And this is really getting to recovering that investment. And if you look to Pennsylvania, I know we did file last week but those rates will not be effective for eight to 10 months. So we took that into consideration as we made that decision. New Jersey was already filed in December, so we continue to work with the commission on that and in Virginia and California the same. But we did look at that very closely. But again because of the timing, we felt like filing now for an outcome that's in 2021 is a reasonable decision in our view.\nSusan Hardwick: And Walter I might just add to that that we certainly are working closely with regulators around this very question. And we have not received direction or signals really from regulators that we should not proceed sort of as usual. So that's a different answer than customer considerations. It's really just also taking into account what regulators are expecting, and we've not really been pushed to delay the normal process as well.\nJonathan Reeder: And then the last question really is just on the military front. Do you expect any new bases will be awarded through the RFP process later this year and either AWK or one of your competitors?\nWalter Lynch: Yes, that's right Jonathan. Of the five that we're pursuing, all indications are they\u2019ll award three this year.\nOperator: This will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Walter Lynch for any closing remarks.\nWalter Lynch: Well, thank you all for participating in our call today. Please know that we value as Investor owners and as the financial analysts who research our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures. We always want to be open and transparent in all our discussions and dealings with you. So you have confidence in your decisions around our company and investments in our stock. If we've not been able to address your question or if you have additional questions, please call Ed and Ralph and they'll be happy to help. Stay safe and thanks again for listening. Have a nice day, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. And you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thank you, Walter and good morning, everyone. Let me first start on Slide 12 with a bit more detail on results for the quarter. First quarter 2020 consolidated GAAP earnings were $0.68 compared to $0.62 per share in 2019. In the first quarter of 2020, GAAP earnings were adjusted for depreciation expense that would have been recorded in the quarter related to the New York subsidiary assets, had they not been classified for accounting purposes as assets held for sale. Also, 2019 GAAP earnings were adjusted for a reduction in the settlement liability related to the Freedom Industries chemical spill.Excluding these two adjustments, earnings per share as adjusted increased $0.06 per share or 9.8%, driven primarily by growth in the regulated business. The regulated business segment results increased $0.08 per share or an increase of 13.6% compared to 2019 earnings. The market based business results increased a penny per share and the parent company decreased $0.03 per share compared to 2019, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the business.Moving on to Slide 13. Regulated operations increased $0.08 per share in total. We saw $0.14 per share increase from additional authorized revenue and surcharges to support infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. O&M expense increased $0.06 per share and depreciation increased $0.03 per share, both to support regulated acquisitions and growth. Also, results reflected $0.03 per share benefit primarily related to lower pension expense from a higher assumed return on assets used to set expense for 2020.The market based business's first quarter results increase compared to 2019, primarily by the homeowner services group's organic growth and contract price increase. Also, as Walter already mentioned, we expect Joint Base San Antonio and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020. And finally, the parent results decreased $0.03 per share, primarily reflecting higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.Moving on to Slide 14. The regulated businesses received $53 million in annualized new revenue in 2020, and this includes $18 million from step increases and $35 million from infrastructure surcharges. We've also found requests and are waiting final orders on the four rate cases and three infrastructure surcharge proceedings for a total annualized revenue request of $224 million. The continued successful execution of our regulatory strategy is a key element of our ability to consistently deliver on these financial results.And before I wrap up on Slide 15, let me add a few additional thoughts related to the expected implications of COVID-19. First, as it relates to demand for our services, American Water has a predominantly residential customer base, residential revenues, including bulk sales are about 69%. Commercial is 21%, mostly in the food and beverage sector and industrial is only 4% of our total revenue. Our very early indications are that our residential load is higher and our commercial and industrial loads are trending down as businesses closed and certain other slowdowns occur.Disconnections in late fees have been suspended and disconnection notices have stopped, as Walter mentioned earlier. We've also reconnected customers previously disconnected for nonpayment and suspended reconnection fees. This is critical to our customers as they work through this difficult situation and we currently don't expect the impact of this temporary measure to be material.It's too early to tell how customers' overall ability to pay will be impacted by COVID-19, so estimated uncollectible accounts exposure to this risk is not yet possible. As is evidenced by regulatory actions across the country to-date, we expect issues like this will be addressed timely and certainly, in future rate cases at the very least. We will work closely with regulators in our jurisdictions on how the cost of this pandemic will be treated for recovery purposes.As Walter mentioned, we invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020 to better serve our customers. At this point, we believe our regularly scheduled capital projects will continue as planned, perhaps with some slowdowns that could be made up later in the year. So I don't believe we'll have any adjustments to our 2020 CapEx levels at this time.We continue to monitor our key suppliers and today have had no major disruptions to our supply chain. Our key distributors are reporting an excess inventory in materials like pipes, valves, hydrants, couplings and our chemical providers are meeting our needs and are reporting those shortages as of this point.As we think about the impact of COVID-19 on our market based businesses for military services, O&M operations currently continue as normal, subject to each installation's individual requirements. As you know, our services are deemed essential so we continue to do what the Department of Defense has hired us to do, which is to deliver safe, clean and reliable water to our military base partners.For homeowner services, while development of new partner relationships maybe delayed somewhat, we believe we can maintain our customer base during periods of economic downturn. And that homeowners really do see value in these products that protect them against large unexpected expenses. And perhaps maybe one final comment before I talk about how we've addressed liquidity. I simply mentioned that our pension plans were funded at just over 80% as of year-end 2019. And though there's been much volatility in the equity markets, as you all know, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2020.Moving to Slide 16, as it relates to liquidity. Obviously, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused great deal of uncertainty and volatility in the debt capital markets. And like many others, we experienced some constraints in the commercial paper market and we have now seen a general loosening in that area. We've been focused on liquidity since this situation really accelerated. In addition to our existing $2.25 billion revolving credit facility that supports working capital needs and capital spending, on March the 20th, we entered into $750 million 364 day term loan at a very favorable rate of LIBOR plus 80 basis points. We have drawn on that term loan at $500 million and we're holding that amount in cash currently.As part of our planned financing for 2020, we executed on the issuance of $1 billion in long-term debt on April 14th. The issue consisted of $500 million in 2.8% coupon senior notes due 2030 and $500 million and 3.45% coupon senior notes due 2050. The proceeds from the long-term debt issuance were used primarily to repay outstanding commercial paper obligations and outstanding draws against our revolving credit facility. We're confident we have sufficient liquidity available for the foreseeable future with $2.8 billion available at the end of April.Moving on to Slide 17, let me summarize now. As Walter said, we expect our 2020 adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share, which is consistent with the guidance range we last announced in February 2020, and which should have been identified as an adjusted guidance range at that time.Our 2020 GAAP earnings guidance range is $3.85 to $3.95 per share. The difference of $0.06 relates to the expected annual depreciation on the New York subsidiary assets, which have been presented as assets held for sale. With the accounting treatment of assets held for sale, GAAP requires a depreciation [fees] on those assets. And the only adjustment currently anticipated between our expected GAAP results and our expected adjusted earnings per share results is that $0.06 of depreciation expense. We've reflected $0.01 per share of that in first quarter reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS.As Walter also mentioned, we are affirming our long-term earnings compounded annual growth rate expectation on an earnings per share basis in the range of 7% to 10%, while investing capital in the range of $8.8 billion to $9.4 billion over the next five years. The decades of capital investment needs continue and drives are $20 billion to $22 billion of investment over the next 10 years. The fragmented water and wastewater landscape continues to provide what we see as a growing pipeline for acquisition.The capital light market based businesses continue to increase customer experience and generate cash. And simply put, our business model and resulting investment thesis is built on fundamentals. And though all segments of the economy are being impacted by this crisis, we see our business as quite resilient and we have built it in a way to endure challenges like this.Finally, moving on to Slide 18. We're working through these very different and turbulent times, we continue to deliver strong consolidated results. Our total company consolidated actual return on equity is 10.6% for the 12 months ended March 31, 2020. Regulatory execution along with strong results from our market based businesses allows us to consistently deliver on our earnings commitment. We believe that delivering on results, combined with our strong earnings growth and superior dividend growth expectations, continue to provide excellent value for our investors.We continue to be a top leader in dividend growth. With our announced increase in dividend of 10%, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 10% or more over the last five years, and we expect to continue that growth well into the 7% to 10% range. Also, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 50% to 60% of earnings.And with that, let me simply turn it back to Walter for a few additional remarks. Let me make just a few comments, Durgesh. And again, I would reiterate it is early. And as we think about across all of our jurisdictions the various states implemented restrictions and stay at home orders at different times. So obviously, depending on when that occurred in each of our jurisdictions that's going to impact when we really started to see a shift in demand expectations. I'd again reiterate what I said in our prepared remarks, roughly 70% of our load is residential and as you can imagine, obviously, folks are at home. So we are seeing in our early data that residential sales are up.And again, I'd hesitate to quantify it because it's still so early. In some cases, we may have six weeks worth of demand data. In other cases, we may only have three or four weeks, again, depending on when those measures were put in place. And in some cases, we have real time meters, some cases we don't. So we have to wait until we have actual billing data. But we certainly are seeing residential usage up.On the commercial side, again, it depends on the jurisdiction and depends on the mix of customers in a particular state. But as you can imagine, commercial is trending down, because of business closures, restaurant closing et cetera. And on the industrial side, while in a particular state it could be a material change. And I'll give an example in Kentucky, we've got a large plant there an auto manufacturer. So in the State of Kentucky, we're seeing a pretty substantial decline in industrial sales, because of the concentration there. But overall, our industrial sales makeup is only about 4% of our total.So again, as you sort of roll all that together, residential is up, the other two are down.

So, again, I'm not getting directly to your quantify it but hopefully, a bit more color there is helpful.

So we're quite confident we'll be able to retain customers, and with that goes the ability to collect on the fees under those contracts. I think, Walter, you're right on target. The only thing I would add, maybe just as a specific example and you mentioned travel one, obviously, we've implemented no travel across all of our jurisdictions. But what you might not be thinking about is added PPE that we've added for all of our employees, including office employees. So there's added expense there, while we may have saved in other areas. So, the bigger picture is we are still on target for our earnings expectations for the year, and I think our ability to navigate all the variables. And the result as our expectations remain the same, I think that gives a pretty good indication of how we're managing. Rich, there's a lot in that question, obviously. And I'd start with just simply saying that where we are today, we are confident in our ability to hit all of the various targets we've laid out.

            "name": "Walter Lynch",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, I'll start by giving you a brief update on our COVID-19 response and then provide key updates on our business. Susan Hardwick, our CFO, will cover the first quarter financial results and provide a few additional comments related to the implications of COVID-19. As you know, American Water provides clean, safe, reliable water and wastewater services and is continuing to do so throughout this pandemic. American Water's established clear priorities across our organization, focused in three areas; the first is the care and safety of our employees and their families; the second is the safety of our customers and the communities we serve; and the third area of focus is the execution of our preparedness plans, so we can continue to provide essential services and help our communities get through this crisis.Let me give some examples that the measures we've implemented. Because safety is our top priority, we've implemented required work from home policy where possible, as well as social distancing and other enhanced safety measures for employees and customers. For example, we've suspended all nonemergency and home appointments and limited the amount and nature of contact with customers during field appointments. We've also worked hand in hand with labor across the business and supported our employees with paid leave for COVID-19 diagnosis, quarantines and childcare.We suspended billing related service shut offs, suspended late fees and have restored service to customers who were previously shut off for nonpayment. We're also working with customers who are experiencing financial hardships by offering customer assistance programs and access to low income programs. Susan will cover this a bit more later, but we've implemented actions to strengthen our liquidity and ensure access to capital. We also continue to execute on our core strategies, such as making needed capital investment. We've increased communications with public service commissions, customers and public officials. As the COVID-19 impact continues to be assessed, American Water will work constructively with public service commissions as they look to address utility response measures, customer protection and cost recovery for all regulated utilities in their jurisdictions.Finally, we provided $500,000 donation to the American Water Charitable Foundation to help fund COVID-19 relief efforts across the United States. This was in addition to $100,000 donation made to feeding America to help support food banks. We understand we have a very important role during this crisis. We provide water and wastewater services for hygiene, hospitals, sanitation and fire protection. We thank all our employees for continuing to provide these essential services.Moving on to first quarter results. The employees of American Water delivered solid results and further strengthened our low risk profile and predictable growth story. Our first quarter 2020 adjusted earnings per share increased 9.8% compared to first quarter 2019. We invested capital of $457 million in the first quarter of 2020, which is 36% increase over the same period last year. This increase is driven by the continued investment in our systems and the communities we serve, along with more favorable construction weather this year versus last.As you know, we work hard to minimize the customer bill impacts of these investments through our continued focus on controlling O&M costs. I'll talk more in a moment about our regulated operations, our continuing progress in regulated acquisitions and their contributions to our long-term growth story. Our market based businesses were up a penny in earnings per share. This was due primarily to growth in customer contracts from homeowner services. As a reminder, in the third quarter of 2019, our military services group was awarded two military contracts, Joint Base San Antonio in Texas and the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. We're on track to assume operations by the second quarter of 2020.Moving to Slide 7, the foundation of our earnings growth continues to be the capital investment we make in our regulated operations to provide clean, safe and reliable service to our customers. We believe that long-term financial success depends on effectively executing the fundamentals of our business every day. We plan to invest $20 billion to $22 billion in capital over the next 10 years to ensure the quality and reliability of our services, and to bring water and wastewater solutions to communities across the country.We're affirming our long-term EPS compound annual growth rate in the 7% to 10% range. We also expect our 2020 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $3.79 to $3.89 per share. This is the same range we communicated in February, which should have been identified as an adjusted EPS range. Our GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $3.85 to $3.95 per share. In her comments, Susan will provide additional information about the difference between our GAAP and adjusted guidance ranges.Also, consistent with our previous dividend guidance, on April 29th, our Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.50 per share to $0.55 per share, a 10% increase. We understand that a secure and growing dividend is important to our shareholders, while striking the right balance with continued investment in our regulated operations.Turning to Slide 8. Let's walk through some of the regulatory highlights of the first quarter of 2020. Pennsylvania American Water filed a general rate case last week, requesting $92 million in the first year and $46 million in the second year. Since our last case in 2017, Pennsylvania American Water will have invested $1.64 billion in infrastructure upgrades for the four year period of 2019 through 2022, including replacing more than 427 miles of aging water and sewer pipes.The case also includes enhancements to our Customer Assistance Program. Traditionally, the public utility commission's review of the filing may take up to nine months, and new rates would not be effective until 2021. Also, in Pennsylvania, the Public Utility Commission approved the company's revision to its wastewater DSIC. This action allows the DSIC to be applied to another 50 thousand wastewater customers effective May 1st. We also have three pending rate cases in New Jersey, Virginia and California.New Jersey American Water filed the general rate case in December 2019, requesting in overall revenue increase of approximately $88 million, excluding the revenue from DSIC. Since our last rate case, we've invested more than $1 billion in system upgrades. Virginia American Water filed a general rate case requesting an overall revenue increase of $5.6 million in November 2018. This case was driven by approximately $98 million in infrastructure upgrades since April 2017. Interim rates became effective on May 1, 2019 and we expect the decision later this year.Moving West, California America Water filed for new rates in July 2019. The case covers 2021 through 2023 and request an increase in authorized revenue of $46.6 million over three years. The request seeks $197 million for infrastructure improvements planned for 2021 and 2022. Due to COVID-19, the evidentiary hearings were moved from April and May to early June with final hearing dates expected in late August. We now expect the decision on this case as early as first quarter of 2021. In addition, we filed a motion for interim rates to be effective back to January 1, 2021.On the legislative front, during the quarter, Indiana Governor Holcomb signed two bills; the first one authorizes recovery for above ground infrastructure without a full rate case; and the second establishes an appraisal process for non-ministry utilities to establish fair value and a reasonable purchase price. In West Virginia, Governor Justice signed a water and wastewater investment and Infrastructure Improvement Act. Effective June 5th, this legislation creates a voluntary process to use fair value assessments to determine the value of the water or wastewater systems, enables combined water and wastewater rate making and expands how municipalities can use the proceeds they receive from selling utility assets to better address needs in their communities.Finally, in Virginia, Governor Northam signed fair market value legislation, which will go into effect on July 1st. This is now the ninth state that has adopted fair market value legislation across our footprint. All this legislation is focused on helping communities and utilities address water and wastewater challenges.Moving to Slide 9. Customers remain at the center of every decision we make today and into the future. This means smart investments balanced by efficient operations and capital deployment. As I mentioned earlier, in the first quarter we invested $457 million with the majority in our regulated businesses, including $432 million in infrastructure investment and $21 million in regulated acquisitions.As we make these critical investments to maintain reliable service, we must also ensure affordability for our customers. We'll continue to focus on O&M efficiency and work toward our O&M efficiency goal of 31.3% by 2024. For the 12 month period ended March 31, 2020, our O&M efficiency ratio improved to 34.5% compared to 35.5% for the 12 month period ended March 31, 2019.Now, to put this into perspective, our adjusted O&M expenses are just slightly higher today than they were in 2010. Since then, we've added approximately 276,000 customer connections, while expenses only increased at a compound annual growth rate of 0.7%. We're very proud of our employees' focus and commitment to controlling costs on behalf of our customers, especially given the current situation and economic challenges some of our customers are now facing.Moving on to Slide 10. We believe our commitment to putting customers first is a key to growing our regulated footprint. So far in 2020, we've closed on five acquisitions in four different states, adding about 6,200 new customer connections. We've also added more than 3,200 customer connections through organic growth in the first quarter. We look forward to adding another 45,800 customer connections through currently signed agreements in eight states, most of which we expect to close this year in 2020. These new agreements reflect our commitment to provide water and wastewater solutions to communities across our footprint.And with that, let me now turn it over to Susan. Thanks, Susan. It's been a month since I've had the honor of leading this company as CEO. I want to take a moment to thank all the employees of American Water. Their response to the current health crisis has been simply incredible. Not only are we providing essential services while keeping safety as our top priority, we've invested in water and wastewater systems, welcome new customers who close acquisitions and work with state leaders, regulators and other key officials.We've also had a significant increase in customer satisfaction. We've achieved all this since the beginning of the year. Our company will emerge strong from this COVID-19 pandemic. How we work together throughout this crisis will have a lasting positive impact on our culture of trust and teamwork. I personally can't wait to once again get out to our business, to our plants, to our operating centers, to our call centers and say thanks to our employees. They're simply the best.And with that, we're happy to take your questions. Susan, you want to take that and then I'll jump in at the end. And I think the key to the usage, again, back to what Susan was talking about is when do these states get back to normal, when do they start opening up. A lot of the commercial establishments and industrial and obviously, we're tracking that very closely as we work with the governor's offices and our plants and working with them. Yes, we're still moving forward with the sale. There's no delay in the regulatory process. And we're working very well with Liberty and we expected to closing that late this year or early in 2021, Durgesh . Well, let me start and then I'll hand it off to Susan. Durgesh, as you know, in my prepared remarks in over the years we focused very closely on O&M expenses. And so that's part of our culture. We're going to continue to do that. We're going to continue to drive O&M expenses down. So that when we invest, we're asking our customers to pay for that investment and not the O&M cost. So again, it's part of our culture, we just -- it's embedded, everybody understands it. And that's, again, the continued focus that we're going to have in this business, not just during the pandemic, as you know. So I'll ask Susan for additional comments. On our two new bases, we've been in transition services since we got the award. And we worked very well at both installations with Joint Base San Antonio and West Point, showing the value to the communities. And we're going to be starting full operations, as I said in my prepared remarks in the second quarter. So, I think it's the trust and confidence that they have in our military services group to take over their water and wastewater systems and do it in a professional and amazing way as our group does with our military services group.So again, we're really proud to have those two new installations, particularly West Point, one of the most important military installations in the country. I'm a graduate of West Point [Multiple Speakers] I'd like to say that. But no, we're really proud of our military services group. They've developed a tremendous reputation and brand with the government. And I think it's the confidence that they have in our group that's move those forward as quickly as we have. So we're in five active solicitations right now. And we expect still this year to hear on three of those. So we're not seeing any measurable delay on behalf of the government and moving those forward. Well, we believe looking at the impact of COVID-19 crisis we're going to have on communities that there are going to be a lot of municipalities that are facing financial challenges. And so when you look at what the efforts that we've put in already over the years of building our pipeline. And again our pipeline is 650,000 customer connections. We've worked on fair market value legislation, we've worked on water quality accountability legislation. And when you really add this COVID-19 crisis and we think it will have an impact on the number of communities that we're having discussions with, so being able to show what we can do and providing solutions for them. We do think it's going to have an impact on those discussions, absolutely. Susan, you want to take that one? Susan, you want to take that -- I mean, mostly it's weather impact, as you know... Jonathan, let me say first that we're very sensitive to the situation that our customers are facing right now. We've been investing as you know, significant amounts in our systems. And this is really getting to recovering that investment. And if you look to Pennsylvania, I know we did file last week but those rates will not be effective for eight to 10 months. So we took that into consideration as we made that decision. New Jersey was already filed in December, so we continue to work with the commission on that and in Virginia and California the same. But we did look at that very closely. But again because of the timing, we felt like filing now for an outcome that's in 2021 is a reasonable decision in our view. Yes, that's right Jonathan. Of the five that we're pursuing, all indications are they'll award three this year. Well, thank you all for participating in our call today. Please know that we value as Investor owners and as the financial analysts who research our company for the benefit of your clients and their futures. We always want to be open and transparent in all our discussions and dealings with you. So you have confidence in your decisions around our company and investments in our stock. If we've not been able to address your question or if you have additional questions, please call Ed and Ralph and they'll be happy to help. Stay safe and thanks again for listening. Have a nice day, everybody."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website.  Following the earnings conference call, an audio archive of the call will be available through February 24, 2022. U.S. callers may access the audio archive toll-free by dialing (877) 344-7529. International callers may listen by dialing 1 (412) 317-0088 and the access code for the replay is 8387509. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website. And I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\nAaron Musgrave: Thanks, Tom. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our December 31, 2021, Form 10-K, each filed yesterday with the SEC. The reconciliation for the calculation of the O&M efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the accompanying slide deck, which has been posted to the Investor Relations page on our website. All statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. In addition, for the purposes of the presentation, our long-term EPS CAGR range is anchored off of the normalized 2021 earnings per share results, our last reported actual results. And with that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President, CEO and CFO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I want to take just a moment to say thank you for all of the thoughtful comments sent our way over the past few months to express your best wishes for Walter in his recovery. I also want to thank those who have reached out over the last few weeks with your encouragement for me in the role as CEO. It's an honor and a privilege to serve this great company. And as I begin this journey, I want to reassure you that our strategy remains unchanged from what we shared with you in November of last year. This team is energized and is in execution mode to deliver on our commitment of 7% to 9% long-term earnings growth by continuing to invest in our infrastructure, grow our regulated operations through acquisition and support our military by growing our military services footprint. We are focused on operating where we create the most value. And now as we've transitioned to a 100% regulated and regulated-like business, we believe we are positioned to deliver even higher quality earnings. There is no other water and wastewater service provider in the United States with our scale and capability. And for our investors that rely on our dividend, we are committed to grow our dividend at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We know that the best way to secure your confidence in us is to deliver. That's exactly what we did in 2021 and what we are committed to do going forward. And with that, let's get to it. Turning to Slides 5 and 6. I'll start by covering our financial results and then share some highlights of our operational excellence in 2021. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, earnings were $6.95 per share compared to $3.91 per share in the same period of 2020. Full year and fourth quarter 2021 results include a gain of $2.70 per share, which reflects the completion of the sale of Homeowner Services in December reduced by the $0.19 per share contribution to the American Water Charitable Foundation from the proceeds on the sale. Full year and fourth quarter 2021 results were $4.25 per share and $0.85 per share, respectively, before the gain on the sale of HOS. This represents an 8.7% growth over 2020 earnings, a strong result that is in line with expectations and demonstrates another year of successfully meeting our annual earnings guidance. Earnings in the regulated business in 2021 increased $0.40 per share. Regulated results include the impact of increased revenues from new rates in effect as well as earnings from acquisitions offset somewhat by higher wages and other labor-related costs. Production, operating and maintenance costs and depreciation also increased in support of growth in the business. Market-Based business results, apart from the gain on the sale of HOS decreased by $0.10 per share compared to 2020, primarily because of the timing of the sale of HOS. Parent company results were $0.04 per share higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. On the people side, I'm very proud that last year marked one of our company's best years of safety performance, an excellent outcome amid the ongoing operational challenges related to the pandemic. We also witnessed the value of our resiliency investments in our New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland operations. We successfully withstood widespread flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida while our customers' drinking water quality was not impacted in any of our service areas. Related to capital investments. Our regulated business achieved $1.8 billion of infrastructure improvements, replacements and other system work in 2021 to better serve our customers. As we made these investments, we continue to work hard to keep customer bills affordable by focusing on operating and capital efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business, along with achieving our supply chain successes throughout the pandemic. As we discussed with you in 2021, regulated acquisitions continue to be a key component of our customer affordability and growth strategies. While we welcomed approximately 20,000 new customer connections through acquisitions in 6 states last year, we know that these results are lower than our annual targets. And of course, acquisition totals fluctuate year-to-year, but we are encouraged that we are currently -- that we currently have acquisitions under agreement covering about 77,000 customer connections to start the new year. Cheryl will talk more about our progress on acquisitions a bit later. And finally, we are pleased to have successfully executed on the sales of HOS and our New York and Michigan operations. As we outlined in November, we will redeploy the proceeds from these divestitures into our regulated business where we can best serve customers and drive efficiencies and thus create value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Turning to Slide 7. We believe the combination of our EPS growth, our dividend and an ESG premium continues to be rewarded by investors, securing our place as a top performer in the utility sector on total shareholder return for many years now. As you can see on this slide, we have delivered an exceptional total return to shareholders of 185% over the past 5 years, including our excellent dividend growth. Based on the long-term plans we've laid out in our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive total shareholder return for many years to come.  Moving to Slide 8. I want to emphasize just a few points here. We continue to believe that our plan, both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it, is supportive of our current credit ratings. As we've told you, both S&P and Moody's agreed with that. They both affirmed our ratings last year following our Investor Day presentation. This was due in part to the recognition of our shift to 100% regulated and regulated-like earnings, coupled with our decision to operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions. They affirm that our solid financial metrics are a good complement to our business profile. We're proud that our A credit rating at S&P is 1 of only 2 in the industry. Our strong credit profile is something we value and we will continue to work hard at maintaining it for the benefit ultimately of our customers. The other thing I'll point out on this slide is our total debt to total capital metric. At the end of 2021, we were at 61%. After adding back to total debt, the initial HOS sales proceeds of $480 million yet to be deployed. This is about 1% better than where we ended 2020 and puts us on a good path to our goal of roughly 60% by the end of our 5-year plan. As we look ahead to 2022, let's turn to Slides 9 and 10 for a recap of some of the important strategies we laid out back in November. The map on Slide 9 clearly demonstrates our geographic diversity and how our scale and size are a key competitive advantage, especially when it comes to customer affordability. Because of our large customer base in each state, we're able to spread capital investment across that base, helping to maintain affordability for our customers. Including the 17 military installations we serve through our military services group, we provide drinking water and wastewater services to an estimated 14 million people in 24 states. On Slide 10, as we laid out in November, we plan to spend $13 billion to $14 billion over the next 5 years and approximately $28 billion to $32 billion over the next 10 years in our regulated business. These capital investments generate significant economic benefit to the local and regional economies while likely improving the environmental footprint of the systems in these communities. This is another demonstration of how the values of ESG are integrated into our everyday work. We'll balance these investments through a disciplined regulatory strategy and strategic cost management to support customer affordability. And again, while there's a ramp-up time related to the increased capital and the recovery of those investments, our earnings will be more consistent and stable in the long term. Turning to Slides 11 and 12. Let's look ahead at our outlook for earnings in 2022 as compared to 2021. As we shared in our earnings release yesterday, we are affirming our 2022 guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. We thought it would be helpful to share some details of the drivers year-over-year since there were several moving parts. As you can see on Slide 11, our regulated earnings growth range in '22 of $0.24 to $0.30 reflects the fact that we are filing several significant general rate cases in '22, along with labor costs and chemical cost pressures this year that may not be recoverable outside of a rate case. So we're back in that regulatory cycle that we've talked about before. And as I've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of sales proceeds from HOS in New York. But we will benefit from the interest income on the HOS note and the revenue share agreement in 2022, helping to offset the loss of earnings from HOS operations. Finally, on Slide 12, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we set forth in November, including 7% to 9% EPS growth through 2026, and we believe well beyond that. Next, I want to cover a few important points about ESG -- about our ESG efforts on Slide 13. American Water has been recognized as an industry leader in ESG for many years now, and we're very proud of those accolades. Today, I want to highlight what I think is an underappreciated aspect of our ESG story, namely our decades-long runway of transformational impact in communities across the U.S. We are positioned through our regulated acquisition growth strategy to lead significant environmental and social change in the communities we serve or will serve in the future. Slide 13 highlights this ESG impact opportunity for an acquired -- for our required systems. But the reality is our entire growth triangle has impactful ESG-related initiatives integrated within each area. As you see and hear us continue to highlight this aspect of our ESG story, you'll begin to see our newly created ESG badge as shown on Slide 13. It will appear both internally and externally in our communications as we raise awareness of the integration of ESG principles and values in all that we do. And you'll see the water drop part of the badge shift from E to S to G as appropriate in order to highlight the key impact for the topic at hand. Let me close on Slide 14 with just 1 example of a story of ESG impact because of American Water's investment. This story comes from Indiana American Water, which serves over 1 million customers in that state. As some of you know, I'm originally from a small town in Indiana, that happens to be just a few hours from another small town in Indiana called Sheridan. A number of years ago, Sheridan was facing significant environmental compliance issues with the U.S. EPA related to its wastewater system. As we so often see the issue became bigger than just an environmental one. The town was facing business development restrictions because of its noncompliance issues. And if you fast forward to today, you can see -- and as you can see listed there on that slide, the many positive changes that have occurred as we partnered with the community to solve those issues. In the future, when you hear us talk about our acquisition pipeline of 1.3 million customer connections, I hope you'll see it in a different light. Sure, it means financial growth opportunity, which is very important to us, but it also means a long runway of opportunities to make a positive impact environmentally and socially. And with that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to cover our operating strategies for '22 in greater detail. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan. Before we dive into our growth triangle to review key operational and financial goals this year, let's turn to Slide 16 to cover our foundations for success in 2022. As Susan mentioned earlier, our strengths start with our unwavering commitment to safety, which is a leading indicator of our company's health, but we must get the other fundamentals of a high-performance culture right as well. Striving for operational excellence helps us work smarter, and it enables us to provide safe, clean and affordable water services for our customers. This means we go well beyond minimum requirements in order to be the industry leader in operational and environmental excellence. This can only be achieved over the long run with a commitment to building collaborative high-performing teams. We know that creating an equitable culture where people feel valued, included and empowered is critical to our ability to serve our customers every day. We share with our employees the ways that they contribute to the success of our company, which inspires them to make a positive difference for our customers and for the communities we serve. The recognition of New Jersey and Illinois American Water for being ranked #1 within the J.D. Power 2021 Water Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study is truly a testament to our employees' commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. I'll talk more about growth in a few minutes. But regarding ESG, we believe the spirit of ESG is just an affirmation of the values we've upheld for decades. From environmental leadership and sustainability to employee engagement and equity, to transparency and good governance, these principles are foundational to our corporate strategy. Turning to Slide 17. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to our regulated business leaders and their teams for achieving our goal of $1.9 billion of capital investments in 2021. It's no small feat to safely and efficiently execute the hundreds of projects across our territories each year. This is especially true in years like 2021 when we reallocated capital midyear in response to a business need. We allocated additional capital to infrastructure investments in the second half of 2021 as we witnessed less of a need for capital acquisitions in the first half of the year. As we've discussed many times, the infrastructure needs across the business are significant, and our teams quickly adjusted to utilize the additional available capital. You can continue to expect us to shift capital between these 2 buckets each year to adjust for changing business conditions. Looking ahead to our step-up in regulated infrastructure investments in 2022 of $2 billion from $1.8 billion in 2021, we'll be focusing on a variety of projects across our footprint. As we've told you before, there are very few major projects in terms of dollar magnitude, but rather hundreds of smaller ones. A few projects planned for 2022 that stand out, though, include $8 million for intake pipe work at our Hopewell, Virginia water treatment plant and $13 million for pipeline and treatment improvements at our Hays Mine water treatment plant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Moving to Slide 18. We want to briefly highlight our continued execution related to growing regulated rate base, which drives our earnings growth. We're also affirming our expectations of 8% to 9% rate base growth over the next decade, which aligns with the $25 billion to $28 billion of investment needs across our systems, plus the rate base we add through acquisitions. Turning to Slide 19. Shown here is our summary of rate case filings. 2022 is a very busy year for general rate cases. We filed 2 cases already in 2022 in New Jersey and Illinois. These filings are driven by recovery of the extensive capital investments we've made since the last cases in those states totaling more than $2 billion combined. We also have 4 active cases from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion this year, including West Virginia, where we invested almost $260 million in upgrading our infrastructure since our last case. To show the magnitude of these filings to date, you can see on Slide 20 that we have a total annualized revenue request of $255 million, which includes 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Already in rates is $218 million in annualized new revenues since January of 2021. This includes $135 million from general rate cases and step increases, including the agreed reduction in revenues for excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $83 million from infrastructure surcharges. For the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to roll in infrastructure investment and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for growth in the business because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in constructive outcomes as we've demonstrated many times over the years. On to Slide 21, where you can see that our focus on customer affordability continues. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies, coupled with our customer growth efforts, have continued to deliver very affordable bills as a percentage of household income for most of our customers. Our customers' bills are currently on average in the range of $45 to $65 per month. As we grow our footprint, we are continuously looking at ways to improve our operating efficiencies as we work hard to limit bill increases over time.  Turning to Slide 22. We continue to work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate. As you can see on the slide, there were multiple pieces of legislation enacted last year that we believe will benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges. Let me highlight just 3. First, in New Jersey, the state's Water Quality Accountability Act was strengthened last year. The enhancements include additional enforcement requirements for reporting data, stronger cybersecurity requirements and asset management plans and requirements for the sale of systems with prolonged violations. Given the national news on cyber threats to our infrastructure, we saw this legislation as an important step taken by the state of New Jersey. Similar legislation also exists in Indiana and Missouri, and we continue to see other states consider bills that set operational standards for all water utilities. Second, we saw fair market value legislation enacted in more states. This important tool for community is now exists in 12 of the states where we operate. Finally, the bipartisan infrastructure package became law and we are currently working at the state level to identify projects where we can use low interest financing made available through an increase in state revolving funds. The savings made possible by these state revolving funds are passed directly to our customers. Meaning we can invest more with less impact to bills. I also want to note that in addition to our historical customer assistance programs, our states are implementing programs that were funded by the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. In Pennsylvania alone, we have distributed nearly $750,000 to customers in need in the first 5 weeks of the new program. It's a great program and 1 that we hope continues. We are already engaging in 22 legislative efforts at both the state and federal level as many sessions are underway.  Turning to Slide 23 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle. I want to start by talking about our sharpened focus on our acquisition strategies. We're very focused on growing in states where we can leverage our competitive advantages. For us, this means a few things. We target acquisitions in the range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers where we have constructive regulatory environments and existing footprint and critical mass. This critical mass is not only helpful to promote customer affordability and cost efficiencies, but as we grow in each state, we will have a greater voice to help solve industry challenges through the legislative and regulatory policies. We also have ample opportunities for wastewater acquisitions where we have an existing water service footprint. Now that we've covered the strategies, let's turn to Slide 24 to look at our 2021 results and our expectations for 2022. While we were pleased to welcome 20,000 new customers across 6 states in 2021, our $135 million of acquisitions was short of our planned target for the year. Some of this was due to COVID as municipalities maintained a cautious approach to evaluating possible solutions for their systems needs in light of potential federal assistance. That said, we are starting this year with about 77,000 customer connections under agreement, which is a very strong number. This includes 74,000 customer connections under agreement as of December 31, of which approximately 45,000 are in York, Pennsylvania, which we expect to close in the second quarter of this year. It also includes 25 more signed agreements from 2021 for acquisitions representing 29,000 customer connections as well as another 3,500 signed in the first 6 weeks of 2022. Of those agreements, Egg Harbor City is the first sale under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act and represents about 3,000 customer connections that we expect to close mid to late year. Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future.  You'll see on the slide, we also had bids accepted representing over 11,000 customers in 5 states at the end of 2021. The bids accepted phase is part of the pathway to acquisition, falling between the pipeline of opportunities and the under agreement phase. In total, our goal is $500 million of acquisitions in 2022, including York. We also have multiple unique opportunities with communities that recognize our competitive advantages. We have great teams in place with great solutions to offer many communities. Combined with our infrastructure investments, we're very confident that we can meet our goal of $2.5 billion of regulated investments in 2022. Turning to Slide 25. Our Military Services Group or MSG, complete our growth triangle and remains an important part of our business. This regulated-like business focuses on serving military installations across the country through 50-year operating contracts and then optimizing revenues on those installations beyond the base contract. We currently serve 17 installations and are actively bidding on 3 additional projects, including Naval Station Mayport in Florida, which we expect will announce the winning bidder the summer. The other 2 active bids are expected to be awarded in 2023. Beyond these 3, there could be nearly 70 other opportunities in the years ahead. The majority of which we think we can win based on our successful track record and our growing expertise in the business. I'll now turn it back over to Susan for some closing remarks. Susan?\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Cheryl. Turning to our final slide, Slide 27. And before we begin Q&A, I want to reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call today. I am confident in the plan that we have in place to grow this business, and I'm confident we have the right teams in place throughout our states at the bases we serve and here in our corporate office to achieve our goals in 2022 and beyond. Our team has consistently delivered on our earnings and dividend growth goals year-over-year. Nothing has changed regarding our team's ability and determination to continue that record of execution. We have, without question, consistently raised the bar in the water and wastewater industry for standards of operating excellence, ESG leadership and financial performance as evidenced in part by our exceptional 5-year total shareholder return of 185%. That's why we're reaffirming the long-term targets we initiated last November.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have for us.\nOperator:  And the first question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: And first of all, I do definitely wish Walter the best of luck and Susan definitely good luck in this new role and I think an important 1 at that.\nSusan Hardwick : Thank you, Insoo. We certainly appreciate that.\nInsoo Kim: First question I think just the -- on the financial side, I just wanted to verify that on your 5-year plan, I think at the Analyst Day, you had talked about, I think, $1.1 billion of equity needs. Just want to confirm that, that is still the right number that we should be thinking of? And if that's the case, and related to that, any thoughts around types of equity issuances, whether it's trade or potential for equity in unit converts?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. And Insoo, we didn't specifically call that out today in the call, but you're absolutely right. The $1.1 billion of equity that we laid out in November is still our current plan. And it is still -- we're still anticipating it in. What I've always sort of characterized as sort of the middle of this 5 years. So you can expect it in the '23, '24 time frame, I think. We are still looking at options. We certainly think there are lots of tools in place to be able to execute effectively here. The size of the issue at just over $1 billion starts to get interesting in terms of size. I think we could easily do that in a single issue, but we want to make sure that we thought through how best to sort of time the issue with the spend. So we may look at sort of staging that over a period of time. Again, roughly sort of in that middle of the 5 years, as I said. So no change in the total, no change in the timing, still need to figure out exactly the final strategy on how we'll issue it. But I think that the sort of basics are unchanged.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. That makes sense. And then just on the CFO process of finding the permanent CFO, are you looking both internally or is it mostly external? And any type of profile that you're looking for, whether it's someone with the experience in the utilities industry or whatnot. just any thoughts you have there so far?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, it's a good question. We have engaged Korn Ferry to help us with the search. We do expect the search to move very quickly. And this is a highly regulated business, as we've talked about. So certainly, individuals that have utility experience, have been in or around the industry will certainly be high on our list of potential candidates.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra: Susan, congrats on your appointment, and also my best wishes for Walter.\nSusan Hardwick : Thank you. Appreciate it.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. So just 1 thing I wanted to clarify. I think Aaron touched on this, but just on the 7% to 9% EPS growth rate starting point, did you guys effectively move that from '20 to 2021 now?\nSusan Hardwick : It is anchored off of our normalized '21. And our practice here typically has been to anchor it off of the most recent actual results. So as we are affirming guidance here and talking about long-term plans, we are anchoring off of '21.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Excellent. And then I think, Susan, you also touched this in your remarks, but -- and I hear you on the strategy being the same. Anything big picture that you would do differently? And I know you've been part and parcel of the strategy, but just any thoughts there.\nSusan Hardwick : No. We think the strategy is quite strong. We obviously made some changes when we came out in November with the plan we laid out in November, and we are absolutely committed to that plan. We think it is the right plan. And as I said at the outset, and I think Cheryl demonstrated in her remarks, we're very confident in our ability to execute on this plan.\nDurgesh Chopra: Excellent. Okay. And then just 1 last follow-up, if I may, and I'll jump back in the queue. Any things, how are you feeling about this New Jersey rate case that you just filed anything for investors to watch on? What are the drivers? anything specifically that we should be focused on as this case progresses?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. I'll let Cheryl comment in a second. But certainly, it's a large case for us. We've got a lot of investments since the last case, believe it or not, in that case, I think it was just 2 years ago. So it's a very important case, large jurisdiction for us. We think we can be and have been very effective in the New Jersey jurisdiction. So we would expect sort of typical issues in this case, but we're very optimistic about the case we have filed and our ability to work through it effectively. Cheryl, anything you want to add to that?\nCheryl Norton: No, Susan, I think really, as you said, the main drivers are the amount of capital that we've invested in the system. And it's a pretty standard case for us, strong team filing the case, and I will just go through the process as we have in the past, and it is important for us, but we feel like we've filed a really strong case with great investments.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.\nAngieStorozynski: Susan, congratulations.\nSusan Hardwick : Thank you, Angie.\nAngie Storozynski: I just wanted to follow up on the equity. So I understand that you have plenty of liquidity right now and that you're trying to match that incremental funding with the spend. But I mean, you could consider an equity forward. There is maybe a way to also monetize some of the smaller, less core assets to avoid the equity. Could you comment on either of those just to get this equity overhang out of the way?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. It's a good question, Angie. And I didn't specifically mention this in response to Insoo's question, but certainly, equity forward is on the list of options for us. We have executed some strategic transactions. We covered that in our remarks here today with the exit of HOS in New York and Michigan. Those are all aimed at creating \u2013 essentially creating equity, creating proceeds for us to be able to invest that lowers the amount of equity we have to do in the marketplace. And obviously, those things were considered in the plan that we laid out in November and are contemplated in the $1.1 billion.  We'll continue to do those evaluations to see if there are other things we should be doing. At our current position, though, we think this is the right set of assets for us to be invested in, in the right jurisdictions. I think the plan, as we have laid out, again, supports the need for that equity in the middle of the plan. And as you've heard me say many times, while I know there's an anticipation for us to issue in the overhang that goes with that, I don't want to prematurely issue it and sort of carry that \u2013 the dilution associated with it unless we've got investments to match it. So we absolutely have it timed in the plan that we think is appropriate. We'll continue to look at options on how best to do it. And any adjustments we would make to that plan, we'll certainly make sure we communicate that. But I don't anticipate any dramatic changes at this point.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then secondly, on any sort of inflationary pressures that you are seeing on the regulated side? And then how, if at all, that could actually help you with any municipal M&A because I'm assuming that those municipally-owned systems also face the same pressures and that might exacerbate their need for funding. So if you could comment on these.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, I'll let Cheryl weigh in here on the impact potentially to municipals. Largely, though, on the inflation side, we are active in the regulatory process. So we'll be hopefully current in reflecting cost impacts to the business through the regulatory process. Obviously, it impacts our customers. So we do our best to maintain or hold those cost impacts down. We've been very successful on the supply chain side over the course of the year and certainly going into the future to be able to hold those cost increases down. And we think, again, we've done so pretty successfully. So any real impacts ultimately to us or the customer should be mitigated.  On the municipal side and is it a driver for them to potentially push them over the edge to want to privatize, I think it's a good question. I think we'll see some reaction to that. We'll see some -- we'll certainly have conversations with some of these municipals on those additional pressures. I don't know that we've seen any real direct impacts yet or any sort of change in the dialogue yet. But I\u2019ll ask Cheryl to comment on if -- what are her thoughts are around that topic.\nCheryl Norton: Yes, Angie, I think it's just 1 more thing that piles onto those municipal systems that just kind of adds to the load that they're feeling right now. The regulatory environment is absolutely significant for putting pressure on those municipal systems to try to find a better solution than operating their own systems. And I think this inflation piece and also the availability of pipe and chemicals and things like that can absolutely just add more pressure. But Susan is right in that, we haven't seen a big push yet as a result directly of that, but anticipated adding to the load.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And if I may, Susan, I know you said that you're sticking with the strategy that you've announced, well, back in -- that you announced back in October or November. Now -- but taking a step back, given the recent pullback in valuations of other water utilities as well, unfortunately, do you actually think that there is -- you could create some value through any larger strategic transactions involving public water utilities?\nSusan Hardwick : Well, Angie, that's a difficult question to answer here. I'm just going to say what I said at the outset. We're very confident in this plan. We have a long track record of execution. We have continued to prepare for this plan and prepare for execution against this plan, and that's what we're intending to do. We are always looking and thinking about the strategy and how it evolves. We have plenty of work to do with this plan, and we're going to continue to execute against it.\nOperator:  The next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: All my best to Walter here and congratulations, Susan. Appreciate the opportunity to connect. So perhaps to kick off here. Absolutely. I look forward to it. So if I can, I think most of them have been answered. On Chester, just to come back to this conversation, I know that you all have indicated your relative confidence. Where does that stand as far as your involvement in that process and your continued confidence there in?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. It's a great question, Julien. Obviously, lots continuing to go on, on that particular system. And I'm going to ask Cheryl actually to comment on what our current thinking there is, which, by the way, has not changed much. But Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Yes, it really hasn't changed, Julien. We believe we bid on the system on the RFP and came in with the highest bid. And it's really up to the receiver to decide what is the best thing for that community. And we believe that the very strong bid puts us in a good spot to be able to close that deal.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Fair enough. Excellent. And Susan, maybe if I can, strategically, I mean, I know the last 2 questions kind of put it out there. But -- any new fingerprint that you're looking at in terms of revised strategy thought process? I know you covered the top of the remarks here, and in Q&A on M&A, but really what I was thinking about is different states, geographies you're looking to enter to. I know that there's a variety of different legislative efforts that you highlighted in your prepared remarks earlier, but as you think about putting your fingerprints on the company here, any revised thinking on state entry, et cetera, or exit for that matter?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, Julien, I wouldn't say revised. I mean, I think our plan has been and always will be to continue to survey the landscape. We like the states that we're in now, and you saw again us make some moves here to sort of refine our footprint to make sure we're in the jurisdictions that we think are most effective for us. And we certainly think that's where we are now. We will continue, as we always have, to continue to evaluate other jurisdictions, both in terms of regulatory climate and legislative climate and the ability to enter a state in a material way. We haven't changed our metrics around that, what we expect to be able to accumulate in a particular jurisdiction.We got to see ourselves to, in our view, at least 50,000 customers within a 5-year period, that hasn't changed.  But we are constantly looking at those -- at all those options. We're constantly evaluating the landscape in each of the other states that we don't currently operate in, just to make sure that the current footprint is the 1 that is most effective for us. So it's an ongoing process, and it has not changed.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, which also concludes today's conference call. Thank you very much for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan. Before we dive into our growth triangle to review key operational and financial goals this year, let's turn to Slide 16 to cover our foundations for success in 2022. As Susan mentioned earlier, our strengths start with our unwavering commitment to safety, which is a leading indicator of our company's health, but we must get the other fundamentals of a high-performance culture right as well. Striving for operational excellence helps us work smarter, and it enables us to provide safe, clean and affordable water services for our customers. This means we go well beyond minimum requirements in order to be the industry leader in operational and environmental excellence. This can only be achieved over the long run with a commitment to building collaborative high-performing teams. We know that creating an equitable culture where people feel valued, included and empowered is critical to our ability to serve our customers every day. We share with our employees the ways that they contribute to the success of our company, which inspires them to make a positive difference for our customers and for the communities we serve. The recognition of New Jersey and Illinois American Water for being ranked #1 within the J.D. Power 2021 Water Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study is truly a testament to our employees' commitment to delivering exceptional customer service. I'll talk more about growth in a few minutes. But regarding ESG, we believe the spirit of ESG is just an affirmation of the values we've upheld for decades. From environmental leadership and sustainability to employee engagement and equity, to transparency and good governance, these principles are foundational to our corporate strategy. Turning to Slide 17. I want to start by expressing my gratitude to our regulated business leaders and their teams for achieving our goal of $1.9 billion of capital investments in 2021. It's no small feat to safely and efficiently execute the hundreds of projects across our territories each year. This is especially true in years like 2021 when we reallocated capital midyear in response to a business need. We allocated additional capital to infrastructure investments in the second half of 2021 as we witnessed less of a need for capital acquisitions in the first half of the year. As we've discussed many times, the infrastructure needs across the business are significant, and our teams quickly adjusted to utilize the additional available capital. You can continue to expect us to shift capital between these 2 buckets each year to adjust for changing business conditions. Looking ahead to our step-up in regulated infrastructure investments in 2022 of $2 billion from $1.8 billion in 2021, we'll be focusing on a variety of projects across our footprint. As we've told you before, there are very few major projects in terms of dollar magnitude, but rather hundreds of smaller ones. A few projects planned for 2022 that stand out, though, include $8 million for intake pipe work at our Hopewell, Virginia water treatment plant and $13 million for pipeline and treatment improvements at our Hays Mine water treatment plant in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Moving to Slide 18. We want to briefly highlight our continued execution related to growing regulated rate base, which drives our earnings growth. We're also affirming our expectations of 8% to 9% rate base growth over the next decade, which aligns with the $25 billion to $28 billion of investment needs across our systems, plus the rate base we add through acquisitions. Turning to Slide 19. Shown here is our summary of rate case filings. 2022 is a very busy year for general rate cases. We filed 2 cases already in 2022 in New Jersey and Illinois. These filings are driven by recovery of the extensive capital investments we've made since the last cases in those states totaling more than $2 billion combined. We also have 4 active cases from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion this year, including West Virginia, where we invested almost $260 million in upgrading our infrastructure since our last case. To show the magnitude of these filings to date, you can see on Slide 20 that we have a total annualized revenue request of $255 million, which includes 2 infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Already in rates is $218 million in annualized new revenues since January of 2021. This includes $135 million from general rate cases and step increases, including the agreed reduction in revenues for excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $83 million from infrastructure surcharges. For the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to roll in infrastructure investment and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for growth in the business because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in constructive outcomes as we've demonstrated many times over the years. On to Slide 21, where you can see that our focus on customer affordability continues. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies, coupled with our customer growth efforts, have continued to deliver very affordable bills as a percentage of household income for most of our customers. Our customers' bills are currently on average in the range of $45 to $65 per month. As we grow our footprint, we are continuously looking at ways to improve our operating efficiencies as we work hard to limit bill increases over time.  Turning to Slide 22. We continue to work constructively with regulators and legislators in the states where we operate. As you can see on the slide, there were multiple pieces of legislation enacted last year that we believe will benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges. Let me highlight just 3. First, in New Jersey, the state's Water Quality Accountability Act was strengthened last year. The enhancements include additional enforcement requirements for reporting data, stronger cybersecurity requirements and asset management plans and requirements for the sale of systems with prolonged violations. Given the national news on cyber threats to our infrastructure, we saw this legislation as an important step taken by the state of New Jersey. Similar legislation also exists in Indiana and Missouri, and we continue to see other states consider bills that set operational standards for all water utilities. Second, we saw fair market value legislation enacted in more states. This important tool for community is now exists in 12 of the states where we operate. Finally, the bipartisan infrastructure package became law and we are currently working at the state level to identify projects where we can use low interest financing made available through an increase in state revolving funds. The savings made possible by these state revolving funds are passed directly to our customers. Meaning we can invest more with less impact to bills. I also want to note that in addition to our historical customer assistance programs, our states are implementing programs that were funded by the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. In Pennsylvania alone, we have distributed nearly $750,000 to customers in need in the first 5 weeks of the new program. It's a great program and 1 that we hope continues. We are already engaging in 22 legislative efforts at both the state and federal level as many sessions are underway.  Turning to Slide 23 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle. I want to start by talking about our sharpened focus on our acquisition strategies. We're very focused on growing in states where we can leverage our competitive advantages. For us, this means a few things. We target acquisitions in the range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers where we have constructive regulatory environments and existing footprint and critical mass. This critical mass is not only helpful to promote customer affordability and cost efficiencies, but as we grow in each state, we will have a greater voice to help solve industry challenges through the legislative and regulatory policies. We also have ample opportunities for wastewater acquisitions where we have an existing water service footprint. Now that we've covered the strategies, let's turn to Slide 24 to look at our 2021 results and our expectations for 2022. While we were pleased to welcome 20,000 new customers across 6 states in 2021, our $135 million of acquisitions was short of our planned target for the year. Some of this was due to COVID as municipalities maintained a cautious approach to evaluating possible solutions for their systems needs in light of potential federal assistance.

Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future.

The bids accepted phase is part of the pathway to acquisition, falling between the pipeline of opportunities and the under agreement phase. In total, our goal is $500 million of acquisitions in 2022, including York. We also have multiple unique opportunities with communities that recognize our competitive advantages.

And it's a pretty standard case for us, strong team filing the case, and I will just go through the process as we have in the past, and it is important for us, but we feel like we've filed a really strong case with great investments. Yes, Angie, I think it's just 1 more thing that piles onto those municipal systems that just kind of adds to the load that they're feeling right now.

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I want to take just a moment to say thank you for all of the thoughtful comments sent our way over the past few months to express your best wishes for Walter in his recovery. I also want to thank those who have reached out over the last few weeks with your encouragement for me in the role as CEO. It's an honor and a privilege to serve this great company. And as I begin this journey, I want to reassure you that our strategy remains unchanged from what we shared with you in November of last year. This team is energized and is in execution mode to deliver on our commitment of 7% to 9% long-term earnings growth by continuing to invest in our infrastructure, grow our regulated operations through acquisition and support our military by growing our military services footprint. We are focused on operating where we create the most value. And now as we've transitioned to a 100% regulated and regulated-like business, we believe we are positioned to deliver even higher quality earnings. There is no other water and wastewater service provider in the United States with our scale and capability. And for our investors that rely on our dividend, we are committed to grow our dividend at the high end of the 7% to 10% range. We know that the best way to secure your confidence in us is to deliver. That's exactly what we did in 2021 and what we are committed to do going forward. And with that, let's get to it. Turning to Slides 5 and 6. I'll start by covering our financial results and then share some highlights of our operational excellence in 2021. For the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, earnings were $6.95 per share compared to $3.91 per share in the same period of 2020. Full year and fourth quarter 2021 results include a gain of $2.70 per share, which reflects the completion of the sale of Homeowner Services in December reduced by the $0.19 per share contribution to the American Water Charitable Foundation from the proceeds on the sale. Full year and fourth quarter 2021 results were $4.25 per share and $0.85 per share, respectively, before the gain on the sale of HOS. This represents an 8.7% growth over 2020 earnings, a strong result that is in line with expectations and demonstrates another year of successfully meeting our annual earnings guidance. Earnings in the regulated business in 2021 increased $0.40 per share. Regulated results include the impact of increased revenues from new rates in effect as well as earnings from acquisitions offset somewhat by higher wages and other labor-related costs. Production, operating and maintenance costs and depreciation also increased in support of growth in the business. Market-Based business results, apart from the gain on the sale of HOS decreased by $0.10 per share compared to 2020, primarily because of the timing of the sale of HOS. Parent company results were $0.04 per share higher in 2021 as compared to 2020. On the people side, I'm very proud that last year marked one of our company's best years of safety performance, an excellent outcome amid the ongoing operational challenges related to the pandemic. We also witnessed the value of our resiliency investments in our New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland operations. We successfully withstood widespread flooding in the aftermath of Hurricane Ida while our customers' drinking water quality was not impacted in any of our service areas. Related to capital investments. Our regulated business achieved $1.8 billion of infrastructure improvements, replacements and other system work in 2021 to better serve our customers. As we made these investments, we continue to work hard to keep customer bills affordable by focusing on operating and capital efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business, along with achieving our supply chain successes throughout the pandemic. As we discussed with you in 2021, regulated acquisitions continue to be a key component of our customer affordability and growth strategies. While we welcomed approximately 20,000 new customer connections through acquisitions in 6 states last year, we know that these results are lower than our annual targets. And of course, acquisition totals fluctuate year-to-year, but we are encouraged that we are currently -- that we currently have acquisitions under agreement covering about 77,000 customer connections to start the new year. Cheryl will talk more about our progress on acquisitions a bit later. And finally, we are pleased to have successfully executed on the sales of HOS and our New York and Michigan operations. As we outlined in November, we will redeploy the proceeds from these divestitures into our regulated business where we can best serve customers and drive efficiencies and thus create value for our customers, employees and shareholders. Turning to Slide 7. We believe the combination of our EPS growth, our dividend and an ESG premium continues to be rewarded by investors, securing our place as a top performer in the utility sector on total shareholder return for many years now. As you can see on this slide, we have delivered an exceptional total return to shareholders of 185% over the past 5 years, including our excellent dividend growth. Based on the long-term plans we've laid out in our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive total shareholder return for many years to come.  Moving to Slide 8. I want to emphasize just a few points here. We continue to believe that our plan, both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it, is supportive of our current credit ratings. As we've told you, both S&P and Moody's agreed with that. They both affirmed our ratings last year following our Investor Day presentation. This was due in part to the recognition of our shift to 100% regulated and regulated-like earnings, coupled with our decision to operate in constructive regulatory jurisdictions. They affirm that our solid financial metrics are a good complement to our business profile. We're proud that our A credit rating at S&P is 1 of only 2 in the industry. Our strong credit profile is something we value and we will continue to work hard at maintaining it for the benefit ultimately of our customers. The other thing I'll point out on this slide is our total debt to total capital metric. At the end of 2021, we were at 61%. After adding back to total debt, the initial HOS sales proceeds of $480 million yet to be deployed. This is about 1% better than where we ended 2020 and puts us on a good path to our goal of roughly 60% by the end of our 5-year plan. As we look ahead to 2022, let's turn to Slides 9 and 10 for a recap of some of the important strategies we laid out back in November. The map on Slide 9 clearly demonstrates our geographic diversity and how our scale and size are a key competitive advantage, especially when it comes to customer affordability. Because of our large customer base in each state, we're able to spread capital investment across that base, helping to maintain affordability for our customers. Including the 17 military installations we serve through our military services group, we provide drinking water and wastewater services to an estimated 14 million people in 24 states. On Slide 10, as we laid out in November, we plan to spend $13 billion to $14 billion over the next 5 years and approximately $28 billion to $32 billion over the next 10 years in our regulated business. These capital investments generate significant economic benefit to the local and regional economies while likely improving the environmental footprint of the systems in these communities. This is another demonstration of how the values of ESG are integrated into our everyday work. We'll balance these investments through a disciplined regulatory strategy and strategic cost management to support customer affordability. And again, while there's a ramp-up time related to the increased capital and the recovery of those investments, our earnings will be more consistent and stable in the long term. Turning to Slides 11 and 12. Let's look ahead at our outlook for earnings in 2022 as compared to 2021. As we shared in our earnings release yesterday, we are affirming our 2022 guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. We thought it would be helpful to share some details of the drivers year-over-year since there were several moving parts. As you can see on Slide 11, our regulated earnings growth range in '22 of $0.24 to $0.30 reflects the fact that we are filing several significant general rate cases in '22, along with labor costs and chemical cost pressures this year that may not be recoverable outside of a rate case. So we're back in that regulatory cycle that we've talked about before. And as I've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of sales proceeds from HOS in New York. But we will benefit from the interest income on the HOS note and the revenue share agreement in 2022, helping to offset the loss of earnings from HOS operations. Finally, on Slide 12, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we set forth in November, including 7% to 9% EPS growth through 2026, and we believe well beyond that. Next, I want to cover a few important points about ESG -- about our ESG efforts on Slide 13. American Water has been recognized as an industry leader in ESG for many years now, and we're very proud of those accolades. Today, I want to highlight what I think is an underappreciated aspect of our ESG story, namely our decades-long runway of transformational impact in communities across the U.S. We are positioned through our regulated acquisition growth strategy to lead significant environmental and social change in the communities we serve or will serve in the future. Slide 13 highlights this ESG impact opportunity for an acquired -- for our required systems. But the reality is our entire growth triangle has impactful ESG-related initiatives integrated within each area. As you see and hear us continue to highlight this aspect of our ESG story, you'll begin to see our newly created ESG badge as shown on Slide 13. It will appear both internally and externally in our communications as we raise awareness of the integration of ESG principles and values in all that we do. And you'll see the water drop part of the badge shift from E to S to G as appropriate in order to highlight the key impact for the topic at hand. Let me close on Slide 14 with just 1 example of a story of ESG impact because of American Water's investment. This story comes from Indiana American Water, which serves over 1 million customers in that state. As some of you know, I'm originally from a small town in Indiana, that happens to be just a few hours from another small town in Indiana called Sheridan. A number of years ago, Sheridan was facing significant environmental compliance issues with the U.S. EPA related to its wastewater system. As we so often see the issue became bigger than just an environmental one. The town was facing business development restrictions because of its noncompliance issues. And if you fast forward to today, you can see -- and as you can see listed there on that slide, the many positive changes that have occurred as we partnered with the community to solve those issues. In the future, when you hear us talk about our acquisition pipeline of 1.3 million customer connections, I hope you'll see it in a different light. Sure, it means financial growth opportunity, which is very important to us, but it also means a long runway of opportunities to make a positive impact environmentally and socially. And with that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to cover our operating strategies for '22 in greater detail. Cheryl? Thanks, Cheryl. Turning to our final slide, Slide 27. And before we begin Q&A, I want to reiterate what I said at the beginning of the call today. I am confident in the plan that we have in place to grow this business, and I'm confident we have the right teams in place throughout our states at the bases we serve and here in our corporate office to achieve our goals in 2022 and beyond. Our team has consistently delivered on our earnings and dividend growth goals year-over-year. Nothing has changed regarding our team's ability and determination to continue that record of execution. We have, without question, consistently raised the bar in the water and wastewater industry for standards of operating excellence, ESG leadership and financial performance as evidenced in part by our exceptional 5-year total shareholder return of 185%. That's why we're reaffirming the long-term targets we initiated last November.  And with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have for us. Thank you, Insoo. We certainly appreciate that. Yes. And Insoo, we didn't specifically call that out today in the call, but you're absolutely right. The $1.1 billion of equity that we laid out in November is still our current plan. And it is still -- we're still anticipating it in. What I've always sort of characterized as sort of the middle of this 5 years. So you can expect it in the '23, '24 time frame, I think. We are still looking at options. We certainly think there are lots of tools in place to be able to execute effectively here. The size of the issue at just over $1 billion starts to get interesting in terms of size. I think we could easily do that in a single issue, but we want to make sure that we thought through how best to sort of time the issue with the spend. So we may look at sort of staging that over a period of time. Again, roughly sort of in that middle of the 5 years, as I said. So no change in the total, no change in the timing, still need to figure out exactly the final strategy on how we'll issue it. But I think that the sort of basics are unchanged. Yes, it's a good question. We have engaged Korn Ferry to help us with the search. We do expect the search to move very quickly. And this is a highly regulated business, as we've talked about. So certainly, individuals that have utility experience, have been in or around the industry will certainly be high on our list of potential candidates. Thank you. Appreciate it. It is anchored off of our normalized '21. And our practice here typically has been to anchor it off of the most recent actual results. So as we are affirming guidance here and talking about long-term plans, we are anchoring off of '21. No. We think the strategy is quite strong. We obviously made some changes when we came out in November with the plan we laid out in November, and we are absolutely committed to that plan. We think it is the right plan. And as I said at the outset, and I think Cheryl demonstrated in her remarks, we're very confident in our ability to execute on this plan. Yes. I'll let Cheryl comment in a second. But certainly, it's a large case for us. We've got a lot of investments since the last case, believe it or not, in that case, I think it was just 2 years ago. So it's a very important case, large jurisdiction for us. We think we can be and have been very effective in the New Jersey jurisdiction. So we would expect sort of typical issues in this case, but we're very optimistic about the case we have filed and our ability to work through it effectively. Cheryl, anything you want to add to that? Thank you, Angie. Yes. It's a good question, Angie. And I didn't specifically mention this in response to Insoo's question, but certainly, equity forward is on the list of options for us. We have executed some strategic transactions. We covered that in our remarks here today with the exit of HOS in New York and Michigan. Those are all aimed at creating \u2013 essentially creating equity, creating proceeds for us to be able to invest that lowers the amount of equity we have to do in the marketplace. And obviously, those things were considered in the plan that we laid out in November and are contemplated in the $1.1 billion.  We'll continue to do those evaluations to see if there are other things we should be doing. At our current position, though, we think this is the right set of assets for us to be invested in, in the right jurisdictions. I think the plan, as we have laid out, again, supports the need for that equity in the middle of the plan. And as you've heard me say many times, while I know there's an anticipation for us to issue in the overhang that goes with that, I don't want to prematurely issue it and sort of carry that \u2013 the dilution associated with it unless we've got investments to match it. So we absolutely have it timed in the plan that we think is appropriate. We'll continue to look at options on how best to do it. And any adjustments we would make to that plan, we'll certainly make sure we communicate that. But I don't anticipate any dramatic changes at this point. Yes, I'll let Cheryl weigh in here on the impact potentially to municipals. Largely, though, on the inflation side, we are active in the regulatory process. So we'll be hopefully current in reflecting cost impacts to the business through the regulatory process. Obviously, it impacts our customers. So we do our best to maintain or hold those cost impacts down. We've been very successful on the supply chain side over the course of the year and certainly going into the future to be able to hold those cost increases down. And we think, again, we've done so pretty successfully. So any real impacts ultimately to us or the customer should be mitigated.  On the municipal side and is it a driver for them to potentially push them over the edge to want to privatize, I think it's a good question. I think we'll see some reaction to that. We'll see some -- we'll certainly have conversations with some of these municipals on those additional pressures. I don't know that we've seen any real direct impacts yet or any sort of change in the dialogue yet. But I'll ask Cheryl to comment on if -- what are her thoughts are around that topic. Well, Angie, that's a difficult question to answer here. I'm just going to say what I said at the outset. We're very confident in this plan. We have a long track record of execution. We have continued to prepare for this plan and prepare for execution against this plan, and that's what we're intending to do. We are always looking and thinking about the strategy and how it evolves. We have plenty of work to do with this plan, and we're going to continue to execute against it. Yes. It's a great question, Julien. Obviously, lots continuing to go on, on that particular system. And I'm going to ask Cheryl actually to comment on what our current thinking there is, which, by the way, has not changed much. But Cheryl? Yes, Julien, I wouldn't say revised. I mean, I think our plan has been and always will be to continue to survey the landscape. We like the states that we're in now, and you saw again us make some moves here to sort of refine our footprint to make sure we're in the jurisdictions that we think are most effective for us. And we certainly think that's where we are now. We will continue, as we always have, to continue to evaluate other jurisdictions, both in terms of regulatory climate and legislative climate and the ability to enter a state in a material way. We haven't changed our metrics around that, what we expect to be able to accumulate in a particular jurisdiction.We got to see ourselves to, in our view, at least 50,000 customers within a 5-year period, that hasn't changed.  But we are constantly looking at those -- at all those options. We're constantly evaluating the landscape in each of the other states that we don't currently operate in, just to make sure that the current footprint is the 1 that is most effective for us. So it's an ongoing process, and it has not changed."

At the end of our prepared remarks, we will as usual open the call for any of your questions. During the conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, as these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our June 30, 2021 Form 10-Q, each as filed with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information related to O&M efficiency ratio can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide decks for this call. The slide deck has also been posted to our Investor Relations page of our website. All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share and for purposes of the anchor year on long term EPS growth guidance, the anchor is weather-adjusted 2020 EPS of $3.84. And with that, I will turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Walter Lynch.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Ed and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results as we continue to execute on our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Let's move to slide five to cover the highlights of our second quarter and six month results. Our second quarter 2021 earnings per share increased 17.5% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Included in the results is a $0.03 per share benefit from weather, primarily in the Northeast where we saw a moderate impact from warmer and drier than normal conditions. In the first six months of 2021, we invested $782 million with the majority dedicated to needed infrastructure improvements to better serve our customers. We continue to work hard to minimize the bill impacts of these investments by focusing on capital and operating efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder, we previously announced an O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025. We also continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions. We have added approximately 11,200 customer connections to-date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 86,900 customer connections through pending acquisitions. I will provide more detail on growth in a moment.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Walter. Let's start on slide 11 with a review of results. Second quarter 2021 earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Walter mentioned, included in earnings is an estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather, primarily in the Northeast where we saw conditions warmer and drier than normal through the quarter. Results for the regulated business segment were $1.18 per share, an increase of $0.21 per share compared to 2020 earnings. Results for the market-based business were $0.11 per share, a decrease of $0.02 per share. And finally, parent company results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period last year. Our 2021 earnings through June 30 were $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.22 per share compared to the same period last year. Results for the six month period include the estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather in the second quarter of 2021. Regulated business results increased $0.27 per share compared to 2020 earnings and our market-based business results decreased $0.05 per share and parent company results were unchanged year-over-year. Moving on to slide 12, let me provide just a few more detailed by business. As I noted earlier, regulated results increased $0.21 per share and we saw $0.30 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a reminder, we saw the 2020 full year impact on demand due to the pandemic to be nearly zero and we see no real lingering impact on demand in 2021. Also, as I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.03 per share increase from warmer and drier than normal weather, primarily in the Northeast. Partially offsetting these results, O&M expense increased by $0.09 per share and depreciation expense increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. The market-based business results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020. The lower results reflect increased claims in 2021 in the homeowner services group. The parent results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020, largely driven by higher interest expense to support regulated growth. While on the topic of result, I would like to also reiterate what we told you last quarter with regard to the company's lower effective income tax rate. This results from an increase in the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes as agreed to through the regulatory process and is largely offset with lower revenue, resulting in no material impact to earnings. And we will continue to see this impact as that amortization continues.\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Thanks Susan. Before we move on your questions, I want to take a few minutes to talk about our ESG highlights of the last six months. We have been hearing from stakeholders that they would like to receive more ESG data on an annual basis. We have publish two new documents on our website. First, we made our environmental policy more visible by posting it on our ESG page. We also posted an ESG data summary, which we will update annually. We also continue to implement best practices and respond to surveys and reports. For example, just last week we submitted our annual CDP climate change response which highlights American Water's efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions and risks associated with climate variability. As we have discussed previously since 2007 through year-end 2020, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 36%. This means we are close to our goal of a 40% reduction by 2025. I also want to mention our recent recognition as a top score in the Disability Equality Index for third year in a row. We firmly believe we are more successful when our workforce reflects the communities that we serve. We are proud to be recognized by DEI and to be an ally to those with different abilities. Finally, as a reminder, we will be publishing and posting our 2019 to 2020 sustainability report this fall. With that, we are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: . Our first question today will come from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hi. Good morning guys.\nWalter Lynch: Good morning Shar.\nSusan Hardwick: Hi Shar.\nShar Pourreza: So just a couple questions here. So first, starting with the sale of the New York utility. Are we too early in the process versus kind of your expectations and guidance? And what is the potential creation of these kind of water authorities mean for the process, assuming the Governor signs them?\nWalter Lynch: Well, we continue to work with Liberty cooperatively to get to the endpoint of selling the systems and we do believe that this sale will happen. We are working with the commission staff, with the commission, with the Governor's office to advance this sale. There's just a lot there as far as the North Shore Water Authority, the South Shore Water Authority, there was legislation passed waiting Governor's approval. That's just all part, I think, of how they are looking at this on Long Island to get this deal done. So again, we continue to work in a cooperative way with everybody to get to the endpoint. We are confident that this will happen.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then the infrastructure bill and DC authorizes almost, I think, $15 billion for EPA water funding and millions annually for, like, program like lead reduction and sewer overflows. Do you sort of see this as they crowding out of sort of the private capital like yours, i.e., slowing potential muni acquisition growth? Or is it kind of a drop in the bucket, from a national perspective?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Thanks for that Shar. And we welcome the attention to the water and wastewater industry. Significant investment is needed over the next 20 years. And we have talked many times about $1 trillion needed. So while this is good money to be put to good causes, there is still a lot to go. And again, we are just happy to be in discussion with the administration as far as in the infrastructure plan. We do think the money set aside for the lead service line replacement and also the PFAS treatment is good and it will help many communities out there. But again, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the overall spending that's necessary. And we don't see it impacting in any way our investment or our growth in the water and wastewater sector through acquisitions.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then just lastly, it sounds like Monterey County is getting closer to filing for eminent domain for the local system assets from Cal Am. There is a third-party study that's, I think, forthcoming based on the June 28 quote. Can we just get an overview of sort of what this process could look like from the timing and valuation perspective?\nWalter Lynch: Well, as we know, this is a multiyear process. And right now, they are working through getting approval from the Local Agency Formation Commission and once they get that approval, they have got to go through a series of different trials, the right to take trial and then evaluation trial. And so again, it will take years to work through that. But the first step is getting through what's called LAFCO, getting their approval before they can move forward with the condemnation.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Fantastic. Thanks guys. That's all I had.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Shar.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Shar.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRyan Greenwald: Good morning everyone.\nWalter Lynch: Hi Ryan.\nRyan Greenwald: Any additional color you can offer at this point around the grand jury subpoena, whether it be timeline for resolution or potential implications as the process plays out?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Ryan, there is really nothing more we can say. It's ongoing. Our disclosure is everything that we can say about it at this point.\nRyan Greenwald: Got it. And then you guys highlighted a couple new state legislative items and then obviously the infra bill at the federal level. Any key states that you are watching from here just in terms of other constructive legislation that could come up, but might be in early days still?\nWalter Lynch: Well, in Pennsylvania, there is a Senate Bill that's right in line with the Water Accountability Act, Water Quality Accountability Act. So we are tracking that. That's working its way through in the Senate and then it will be introduced into the House over there. So we are expecting that to progress this year in 2021. So keep an eye out for that. That will be the fourth state. As you know, we are working with Missouri and Indiana to get theirs and also started here in New Jersey. So we are thrilled that Pennsylvania is moving forward with that.\nRyan Greenwald: Great. And then maybe just lastly, in terms of the New York American Water sale, piggybacking off the earlier question, is the expectation that the whole New York American Water operations would ultimately get sold to Liberty? Or do you expect to carveout with the new authorities?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. We are working through that. We do expect the sale to go to Liberty in its entirety and then they would work through whatever comes after that.\nRyan Greenwald: Great. I appreciate the time.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hi. Good morning team. Thanks for taking my question.\nWalter Lynch: Hi Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hi Walter. Just a quick clarification on the New York American. Just, Susan, I think you mentioned in last call that the sale doesn't impact whether New York ends up being sold or not, it doesn't impact, A, the amount of equity and timing of the equity? Is that still the case?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. That's still the case, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Perfect. And then maybe just got two quick things on 2021. Susan, just market-based earnings continue to be down. This is the second consecutive quarter. And you mentioned in claims expense. Can you maybe just elaborate on that a little bit? Is this still sort of the Texas event from Q1 dragging on to Q2? Or are there claims in certain parts of other service territory that are more adverse than others?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Let me make just a couple comments and Walter can certainly weigh in. I think the weather event that we saw in the first quarter in Texas and Illinois, that was really isolated to the first quarter. But we have seen the continuation of sort of higher claims experience, I think really largely driven by more at-home activities. We have got more folks at home and there is more pressure on systems. And so we are seeing more failures and more work being done by the HOS team and so that claims experience has been a bit higher than we would have expected. And I think you can also expect higher claims just simply from growth in the business. We have seen more of that occur. And there is also a little bit of higher marketing expense. We didn't call that out specifically, but a bit more marketing expense, as we continue to introduce new products throughout the HOS territory. So it really is a factor, I think, of sort of the pandemic itself and just a bit higher experience than we would have anticipated.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That's super helpful. And then just one last for me. Can you just share the July weather experience across your service territories?\nWalter Lynch: Well, again, we benefit from having diversity across, geographic diversity across our systems. So we have seen some wetter than normal conditions in some areas, but offset by drier in others. But overall, I would say again, some additional precipitation in some areas, in others not so., but all we can set this point, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: So it sounds more like neutral. Okay. Thanks guys. Much appreciate the time.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. My first question is on the pace of M&A, tuck-in acquisitions. It seems like you still have a pretty healthy run rate going there. What's a good annualized customer additions rate that we should be embedding maybe in the five-year plan and that might be in your plan as well?\nWalter Lynch: Well, at 1.5% to 2%, we are around 50,000 to 60,000 to 70,000 customers a year, is what you should think in that term. And again, we continue to build our pipeline, Insoo. And we have increase it from 1.23 million to 1.3 million. We continue to have discussions with communities across our footprint because we can provide solutions and that's what they are looking for. So we are really proud of our efforts there and we just continue to build that pipeline. And we are really proud to have 37 different deals signed up, waiting the regulatory approval across eight different states. So the growth is not just happening in two or three or four states, it's happening across our footprint.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. And then just a little bit more broadly, as we see, you just continue to increase focus on whether it's at the federal level or state level on the water infrastructure, water quality, whatnot. And you guys always provide a breakdown of the different investments you make on an annual basis, whether it's pipes, sourcing, IT, others. Where do you think the most upside opportunities exist as we go through time? And if there is, just to address on some of these increased focus on these items, is it more of technological advancements that we might not be baking in? Just curious on your broader thoughts\nWalter Lynch: It's a real combination. I would say, looking at the categories that water quality and resiliency are going to continue to get a good size of our investment and maybe even increasing over time, just because with all the storms and the weather variability out there, we need to continue to make sure that our systems are resilient and we need to continue to address the emerging contaminants like PFAS and other. So it's going to require significant investment. Hopefully that answers your question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Reeder: Hi. Good morning, Walter and Susan. A couple for you, start with Missouri. Walter, the revised infrastructure surcharge program, is that going to allow you to extend the time between rate cases or the fact that it kind of encompasses a wider range of eligible standard to kind of keep you on a three-year cadence?\nWalter Lynch: We will continue to evaluate that, Jonathan. We are just really thrilled that we were able to expand the program outside of St. Louis County. And our team has worked hard to provide the input to the commission to see how important that is that we invest across our footprint in Missouri. So we are excited about that. And also increasing the cap so we can make more investment before we have to go into a rate case. So it may contribute in some way to the time in between rate cases.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And then shifting closer to you, Pennsylvania. What is the latest on the commissioner appointments to fill the open seat post Commissioner sweeps? I know Governor withdrew his one nominee back in May. Is there any updates along those lines?\nWalter Lynch: No. None here. Well, Pennsylvania Commission has always been great to work with and reasonable in their treatment towards us and we expect that going forward.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. Are you assuming or maybe what do you anticipate in terms of the timing of the close of the York wastewater deal? Is that assumed by the end of this year in order to get to that $300 million of M&A capital deployed?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. We are assuming, at this point, the first half of 2022. We submitted our application on July 1. The Commission is looking at it. Once they deem it complete, then they will start processing. And again, we think first half of 2022.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. So without it, I guess I just kind of struggle to get to that $300 million based on what's in the hopper. Is there something I am missing? Or do you just have enough pending deals that close, excluding the York one to get you to that $300 million? Or is that something that might fall a little short this year, but then next year is going to more than offset it with the York deal?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Let me say, we are confident in the $1.9 billion number and that's from obviously, the investment in our systems and the acquisitions that we are making.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And then maybe, Susan, going back to Durgesh's question along homeowner services. If the claims, I guess, were year-to-date, if they are more in line with historic levels, how would the market-based businesses year-to-date EPS compare to last year? Would it make up the entire $0.05 lower delta?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, I think that's a fair way to look at it. Again, we have just seen a much higher claims experience than we have in the prior periods. And we really think, again, much of it is related to more at-home activities. The business continues to grow. We continue to execute on our partnership arrangements. We continue to look for new products and roll out new products in that business. So I think the business is just fundamentally doing what we have set out for it to do. This claims experience issue is one that I think, again, is directly related to just activity. And we will hopefully see that mitigate some as we head into the latter part of this year and into next as we hopefully, although it's difficult to sort of imagine that on a day-to-day basis these days, we would return to some sort of a normal environment where people are sort of out of the homes and back in work environments. But that really is the primary driver. I would say the rest of the business is operating as we would expect it to.\nJonathan Reeder: Got you. Yes. Amen to getting back to that normalcy. Okay. So it sounds like, I mean everything other than that's kind of going well, whether it's, I guess, you get to reprice the kind of the claims level for some reason, that doesn't, I guess, the overall trajectory of market-based business to that 7% to 10% is still very much, I guess, kind of where you would expect it to be absent this kind of temporary hiccup?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think that's right. That's the way to look at it.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions today.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Jonathan.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Jonathan.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Walter Lynch for any closing remarks.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you for joining our call today. We value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope that our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and the investment of our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team. They will be happy to answer them. Thanks again and be safe.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks Walter. Let's start on slide 11 with a review of results. Second quarter 2021 earnings were $1.14 per share compared to $0.97 per share in the second quarter of 2020. As Walter mentioned, included in earnings is an estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather, primarily in the Northeast where we saw conditions warmer and drier than normal through the quarter. Results for the regulated business segment were $1.18 per share, an increase of $0.21 per share compared to 2020 earnings. Results for the market-based business were $0.11 per share, a decrease of $0.02 per share. And finally, parent company results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period last year. Our 2021 earnings through June 30 were $1.87 per share, an increase of $0.22 per share compared to the same period last year. Results for the six month period include the estimated $0.03 per share favorable impact from weather in the second quarter of 2021. Regulated business results increased $0.27 per share compared to 2020 earnings and our market-based business results decreased $0.05 per share and parent company results were unchanged year-over-year. Moving on to slide 12, let me provide just a few more detailed by business. As I noted earlier, regulated results increased $0.21 per share and we saw $0.30 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect from acquisitions and from the lower demand in the second quarter of 2020 from the COVID-19 pandemic. As a reminder, we saw the 2020 full year impact on demand due to the pandemic to be nearly zero and we see no real lingering impact on demand in 2021. Also, as I mentioned previously, results reflect an estimated $0.03 per share increase from warmer and drier than normal weather, primarily in the Northeast. Partially offsetting these results, O&M expense increased by $0.09 per share and depreciation expense increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. The market-based business results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 as compared to the second quarter of 2020. The lower results reflect increased claims in 2021 in the homeowner services group. The parent results decreased $0.02 per share in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020, largely driven by higher interest expense to support regulated growth. While on the topic of result, I would like to also reiterate what we told you last quarter with regard to the company's lower effective income tax rate. This results from an increase in the amortization of excess accumulated deferred income taxes as agreed to through the regulatory process and is largely offset with lower revenue, resulting in no material impact to earnings. And we will continue to see this impact as that amortization continues. Hi Shar. Thanks Shar. Yes. That's still the case, Durgesh. Yes. Let me make just a couple comments and Walter can certainly weigh in. I think the weather event that we saw in the first quarter in Texas and Illinois, that was really isolated to the first quarter. But we have seen the continuation of sort of higher claims experience, I think really largely driven by more at-home activities. We have got more folks at home and there is more pressure on systems. And so we are seeing more failures and more work being done by the HOS team and so that claims experience has been a bit higher than we would have expected. And I think you can also expect higher claims just simply from growth in the business. We have seen more of that occur. And there is also a little bit of higher marketing expense. We didn't call that out specifically, but a bit more marketing expense, as we continue to introduce new products throughout the HOS territory. So it really is a factor, I think, of sort of the pandemic itself and just a bit higher experience than we would have anticipated. Yes, I think that's a fair way to look at it. Again, we have just seen a much higher claims experience than we have in the prior periods. And we really think, again, much of it is related to more at-home activities. The business continues to grow. We continue to execute on our partnership arrangements. We continue to look for new products and roll out new products in that business. So I think the business is just fundamentally doing what we have set out for it to do. This claims experience issue is one that I think, again, is directly related to just activity. And we will hopefully see that mitigate some as we head into the latter part of this year and into next as we hopefully, although it's difficult to sort of imagine that on a day-to-day basis these days, we would return to some sort of a normal environment where people are sort of out of the homes and back in work environments. But that really is the primary driver. I would say the rest of the business is operating as we would expect it to. Yes. I think that's right. That's the way to look at it. Thanks Jonathan."

            "content": "Thanks Ed and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Once again, the employees of American Water delivered solid results as we continue to execute on our low-risk profile and predictable growth story. Let's move to slide five to cover the highlights of our second quarter and six month results. Our second quarter 2021 earnings per share increased 17.5% compared to the second quarter of 2020. Included in the results is a $0.03 per share benefit from weather, primarily in the Northeast where we saw a moderate impact from warmer and drier than normal conditions. In the first six months of 2021, we invested $782 million with the majority dedicated to needed infrastructure improvements to better serve our customers. We continue to work hard to minimize the bill impacts of these investments by focusing on capital and operating efficiencies, constructive regulatory outcomes and by leveraging the size and scale of our business. As a reminder, we previously announced an O&M efficiency target of 30.4% by 2025. We also continue our disciplined approach to regulated acquisitions. We have added approximately 11,200 customer connections to-date through closed acquisitions and organic growth and look forward to welcoming an additional 86,900 customer connections through pending acquisitions. I will provide more detail on growth in a moment. Yes. Thanks Susan. Before we move on your questions, I want to take a few minutes to talk about our ESG highlights of the last six months. We have been hearing from stakeholders that they would like to receive more ESG data on an annual basis. We have publish two new documents on our website. First, we made our environmental policy more visible by posting it on our ESG page. We also posted an ESG data summary, which we will update annually. We also continue to implement best practices and respond to surveys and reports. For example, just last week we submitted our annual CDP climate change response which highlights American Water's efforts to address greenhouse gas emissions and risks associated with climate variability. As we have discussed previously since 2007 through year-end 2020, we have reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 36%. This means we are close to our goal of a 40% reduction by 2025. I also want to mention our recent recognition as a top score in the Disability Equality Index for third year in a row. We firmly believe we are more successful when our workforce reflects the communities that we serve. We are proud to be recognized by DEI and to be an ally to those with different abilities. Finally, as a reminder, we will be publishing and posting our 2019 to 2020 sustainability report this fall. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Good morning Shar. Well, we continue to work with Liberty cooperatively to get to the endpoint of selling the systems and we do believe that this sale will happen. We are working with the commission staff, with the commission, with the Governor's office to advance this sale. There's just a lot there as far as the North Shore Water Authority, the South Shore Water Authority, there was legislation passed waiting Governor's approval. That's just all part, I think, of how they are looking at this on Long Island to get this deal done. So again, we continue to work in a cooperative way with everybody to get to the endpoint. We are confident that this will happen. Yes. Thanks for that Shar. And we welcome the attention to the water and wastewater industry. Significant investment is needed over the next 20 years. And we have talked many times about $1 trillion needed. So while this is good money to be put to good causes, there is still a lot to go. And again, we are just happy to be in discussion with the administration as far as in the infrastructure plan. We do think the money set aside for the lead service line replacement and also the PFAS treatment is good and it will help many communities out there. But again, it's a drop in the bucket compared to the overall spending that's necessary. And we don't see it impacting in any way our investment or our growth in the water and wastewater sector through acquisitions. Well, as we know, this is a multiyear process. And right now, they are working through getting approval from the Local Agency Formation Commission and once they get that approval, they have got to go through a series of different trials, the right to take trial and then evaluation trial. And so again, it will take years to work through that. But the first step is getting through what's called LAFCO, getting their approval before they can move forward with the condemnation. Thanks Shar. Hi Ryan. Yes. Ryan, there is really nothing more we can say. It's ongoing. Our disclosure is everything that we can say about it at this point. Well, in Pennsylvania, there is a Senate Bill that's right in line with the Water Accountability Act, Water Quality Accountability Act. So we are tracking that. That's working its way through in the Senate and then it will be introduced into the House over there. So we are expecting that to progress this year in 2021. So keep an eye out for that. That will be the fourth state. As you know, we are working with Missouri and Indiana to get theirs and also started here in New Jersey. So we are thrilled that Pennsylvania is moving forward with that. Yes. We are working through that. We do expect the sale to go to Liberty in its entirety and then they would work through whatever comes after that. Thank you. Hi Durgesh. Well, again, we benefit from having diversity across, geographic diversity across our systems. So we have seen some wetter than normal conditions in some areas, but offset by drier in others. But overall, I would say again, some additional precipitation in some areas, in others not so., but all we can set this point, Durgesh. Well, at 1.5% to 2%, we are around 50,000 to 60,000 to 70,000 customers a year, is what you should think in that term. And again, we continue to build our pipeline, Insoo. And we have increase it from 1.23 million to 1.3 million. We continue to have discussions with communities across our footprint because we can provide solutions and that's what they are looking for. So we are really proud of our efforts there and we just continue to build that pipeline. And we are really proud to have 37 different deals signed up, waiting the regulatory approval across eight different states. So the growth is not just happening in two or three or four states, it's happening across our footprint. It's a real combination. I would say, looking at the categories that water quality and resiliency are going to continue to get a good size of our investment and maybe even increasing over time, just because with all the storms and the weather variability out there, we need to continue to make sure that our systems are resilient and we need to continue to address the emerging contaminants like PFAS and other. So it's going to require significant investment. Hopefully that answers your question. We will continue to evaluate that, Jonathan. We are just really thrilled that we were able to expand the program outside of St. Louis County. And our team has worked hard to provide the input to the commission to see how important that is that we invest across our footprint in Missouri. So we are excited about that. And also increasing the cap so we can make more investment before we have to go into a rate case. So it may contribute in some way to the time in between rate cases. No. None here. Well, Pennsylvania Commission has always been great to work with and reasonable in their treatment towards us and we expect that going forward. Yes. We are assuming, at this point, the first half of 2022. We submitted our application on July 1. The Commission is looking at it. Once they deem it complete, then they will start processing. And again, we think first half of 2022. Yes. Let me say, we are confident in the $1.9 billion number and that's from obviously, the investment in our systems and the acquisitions that we are making. Thanks Jonathan. Thank you for joining our call today. We value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope that our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and the investment of our stock. If you have any additional questions, please call the IR team. They will be happy to answer them. Thanks again and be safe."

And thank you for joining us for today's call. And at the end of our prepared remarks, as usual, we will open the call up for your questions. Now during this conference call, both in our prepared remarks and in answers to your questions, we may make forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based upon our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and other factors, as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our May 3, 2021 Form 10-Q, each as filed with the SEC. Reconciliations for non-GAAP financial information related to O&M efficiency ratio and return on equity can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the slide deck for this call. Also, this slide deck has been posted to our Investor Relations page of our website. All statements in this call related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. And for purposes of the anchor year on long-term EPS growth guidance, the anchor is weather adjusted 2020 EPS of $3.84. And with that, I will turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Walter Lynch.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Ed. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Before we move to quarter results, let me speak for a moment about our recent growth news. As you know, a key part of our strategy is to operate in states where we can best serve customers, drive efficiencies and continue to grow our regulated business. Recall that earlier in the year, we announced the sale of our Michigan operation and as you know in late 2019, we announced the sale of our New York operation. This slide shows what our new regulated service territory will look like after the announced transactions are completed. Moving to slide six. We recently announced what will be the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. On April 6, we signed an agreement to acquire the wastewater treatment and collection system for the City of York, Pennsylvania. This agreement will add an equivalent customer connection total of more than 45,000. As part of the agreement, Pennsylvania American Water will also continue to provide contracted wholesale waste water treatment and disposal for seven surrounding communities of York. We look forward to developing strong relationships that meet the needs of all customers, including those outside the city.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Walter. Let's start on slide 13 with a bit more detail on the results. As Walter highlighted, first quarter 2021 earnings were $0.73 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter 2020. Results for the regulated business segment were $0.74 per share, an increase of $0.06 per share, primarily driven by continued growth from infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. Results for the market-based business were $0.09 per share, a decrease of $0.03 per share as we saw an increase in claims in the homeowner services group, due largely to weather-related events. Parent company results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. Moving on to slide 14. Regulated results increased $0.06 per share. As I said, we saw $0.19 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect, as well as earnings from acquisitions. O&M expense increased by $0.08 per share and somewhat offsetting was an increase in depreciation of $0.05 per share in support of growth in the business. As previously mentioned, the market-based business results decreased $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. The lower results were due to increased claims expense which was driven by extreme cold weather, primarily in Texas and Illinois and the continuation of stay at home activity that we saw throughout most of 2020 due to the pandemic. The parent results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of last year. The improved results were largely driven by a number of small items that increased expenses in the first quarter of 2020, offset by higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Susan. Before we move on to your questions, in April, we were very proud to issue our first annual Inclusion & Diversity Report. This report highlights the efforts we have undertaken and the strides we made advancing our commitment to inclusion and diversity. ESG is a journey and our I&D Report is another way that shows how we are constantly striving thanks for the contributions of every employee to build and inclusive and mutual respect in the workplace. To launch this report internally, we were honored to have Mr. Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson join us virtually for conversation on inclusion, diversity and on allyship. Additionally, we had an incredible community healing discussion with our employees to provide a chance for even more open and honest dialogue on inclusion. We believe that a company's strength is it's people and the diversity of our workforce makes us even stronger. With that, we are happy to take your questions.\nOperator: . First question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hi. Good morning, Walter and Susan.\nSusan Hardwick: Good morning\nWalter Lynch: Good morning Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. Just, I have couple here. First, Walter, just to clarify, the New York American sale process, I know a lot of moving pieces. But are we still targeting a this year close? Is that the current plan?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. That's right, Durgesh. We are still working through with, as I said in prepared remarks, still working through with staff and others. And we are hoping to be expecting this year.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Thank you. And then just on the subpoena. Can I just clarify that this is related to specifically homeowner services within American Water Resources business? And the information that you might be sharing, is that just New York specific or are there are other states involved in the subpoena?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. It's specific to our New York City Metropolitan operations in HOS. That's exactly right, Durgesh.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. And obviously there is no set time line here as to how this matter gets resolved?\nWalter Lynch: No, not at this point. Again, we continue to work in cooperating the investigation.\nDurgesh Chopra: Okay. Understood. Just one big picture then. Walter, just your thoughts on the Biden sort of the American job plan. They talk about several hundred billion of investment on lead and then water and wastewater assets. What are the implications to your existing business? And then just your regulated acquisition growth strategy?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Durgesh, let me start with, we are really happy that the administration is focusing on water and wastewater as part of the infrastructure plan. So we like the attention that the industry is getting. And we think that the plan will benefit our customers, primarily by having access to low interest financing that's part of the plan. And so we access it right now on the water side. We want to get access on the wastewater side. That's a growing segment of our business and we want our customers to benefit like others from the low interest loans. So overall, we are very excited about the program and we want to participate like the municipalities do on the wastewater side.\nDurgesh Chopra: Perfect. And just does it increase your footprint on the regulated acquisition side? Or does it, since there would lot of aid given to systems across the country, does it derail your regulated acquisition growth strategy? How would you sort of characterize that?\nWalter Lynch: Well, as we have said and I have said in my remarks, there is significant need out there in the water and wastewater side. For us, it's not going to change our plan. Our pipeline continues to grow. We are going to continue to provide meaningful solutions for communities and we are committed to our plan. We don't see any change to our plan going forward.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Perfect. Thanks guys. Much appreciate the time.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Durgesh.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Durgesh.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hi. Good morning team. Thanks for the time and opportunity. Maybe to kick things off after Durgesh's question here. Can I follow-up and ask you guys about your latest thinking on the administration just around the PFAS regulation? Hazardous determinations there and just obviously there is a lot of different pieces that could move here. Any, at least preliminary thoughts on where things could go and more specifically how that could impact your business?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Julien, thanks for the question. We think there is going to be a lot more focus on PFAS in this administration. I know they formed a task force, I believe it was last week, to look at what are the next steps to establish an MCL. Right now, there is a health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion and we think that there is going to be a lot more focus on it. So we will have to wait-and-see. But the EPA is really science-driven. They may want to make sure it's based on science. And I think there is going to be a coming together of the science and the need to establish an MCL. And we look forward to participating and working with the administration to establish that.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And hazardous determination, that's just part of the broader context here, right?\nWalter Lynch: That's right. That's all part of this work that's going to be going on.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. All right. Excellent. And then I suppose a little bit more nuanced here. As you think about the impact here in the quarter on the market-based business here, you are probably still broadly within plan on the year and have some offsets. Just can you speak to that? Obviously, the payouts and the warranties, et cetera, obviously still elevated here? Just if you can speak to that a little bit on the offset, et cetera and how you are tracking?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. With the HOS business, we are seeing higher claims on the wastewater side. People are spending more time in their homes and that's causing families additional breaks that we are having to repair. And then on the partnership side, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in those partnerships. Yet, we still have a really good pipeline of opportunities. So those are the two areas, I think, that a been somewhat impacted by the pandemic in our business going forward.\nSusan Hardwick: Julien. I might just add on that point. In addition to what Walter said, we did see a little bit higher claims in the quarter from these weather-related events. We did see some water claims, particularly in Texas, Illinois and a few of the parts of the country, really driven by the extreme weather that occurred. And we would expect, of course, that to now sort of be over. Some of the wastewater claims that Walter's talking about, as long as we continue this bit more stay at home, we may see elevated claims there. But I think the exposure to the weather-related, we have isolated in this quarter.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. So how do you think about that relative to full year? Obviously, if the wastewater continues a little bit elevated, just offsets, et cetera? Probably not too material, right?\nSusan Hardwick: It's really not too material now. And we saw roughly a penny or so of that impact related to the stay at home activity in this quarter. And as you can see across the country, states are starting to loosen up. So there will be some return. So I certainly think we will see this start to mitigate. And in any event, we don't see it as material for the year.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Excellent, guys. Thank you all very much. Have a nice day.\nWalter Lynch: Thanks Julien.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Julien.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question from Insoo Kim of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nInsoo Kim: Thank you. Just a couple for me. The first one, with the recently announced Pennsylvania, New Jersey transactions, how do you think about potential cadence and magnitude of the equity guidance that you gave at the Analyst Day? Just thinking through 2021, 2022, if it's going to be split up? Or are we still assuming kind of, say, April's number is one year?\nWalter Lynch: Well, first, let me talk about the growth. And we are really excited for these two acquisitions in our two biggest states. It's all part of what we are doing in providing solutions for communities with the City of York on the wastewater side and then Egg Harbor City. In the first WIPA, that's really important, the first WIPA acquisition and we are hopeful many other communities are going to see the benefits of that and continue to sell their systems to New Jersey American Water and Pennsylvania American Water. But it's really about providing meaningful solutions. And again, as we have talked about having consolidated tariffs and the ability to spread those costs across a big customer base, over 700,000 customer connections, really helps those communities to mitigate and minimize customer bill impact. So that's a competitive advantage of ours. It's part of our strategy to make sure that these communities understand the value that we can bring to them through investment and I want the spotlight the follow on investment and how significant that is to our growth and to providing solutions for communities. So we are really excited about these two acquisitions and how they are going to play into future growth in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.\nSusan Hardwick: Insoo, maybe let me just comment on the equity needs, because that was a follow-on part of your question, I think. When we built our plan and laid out our financing plan over the five years, we anticipated an increase in our growth from acquisition and we reflected that at Analyst Day. Now whether or not we have identified these specific transactions, that's a different question. But we had anticipated a step-up in growth and built our plan accordingly. So long answer to your question, I don't see any change from these specific acquisitions that we have now highlighted, any change to our equity financing timing or any of other our financing plans over the course of the five years.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. Just from a timing perspective, is there a possibility that we could see some of that equity in the 2021 timeframe? Or is it more beyond 2021?\nSusan Hardwick: No. It's beyond 2021. At Analyst Day, I think we indicated that there is about $700 million of equity in the five years and it's still roughly in sort in the middle of that five year timeframe. So no, I would not anticipate anything in 2021.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And then my second question, I guess maybe for Walter is, obviously these two acquisitions in states that have favorable systems in place for such growth. With the pending New York sale and then the recently announced Michigan divestiture as well, when you just look across your footprint in the different states, you don't have to name any, but are these opportunity to potentially monetize some of the other states to concentrate more on the jurisdictions that offer better systems for organic and inorganic growth?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. We do a constant assessment of where we are operating, where can we provide the best value for customers and where can we grow our systems. And we will continue to evaluate our footprint. But we are really happy where we are right now and we continue to grow. If you look at our pipeline, we are growing. We have eight states where we have 32 agreements. So it's not just in one or two or three states. It's really across our footprint. And we will continue to provide solutions again for communities across our footprint.\nInsoo Kim: Understood. Thank you both.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Insoo. .\nOperator: Thank you. Next question comes from Steve Fleishman of Wolfe Securities. Please go ahead.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi. Good morning.\nSusan Hardwick: Hi Steve.\nWalter Lynch: Good morning.\nSteve Fleishman: Hi Walter. So just a question on the disclosure of this subpoena in homeowner services. I guess it doesn't say, I think, in your release just if the company has done its own investigation and if they determined anything was done wrong? Do you have any color or information on that?\nWalter Lynch: Yes, Steve. And given that it is an ongoing investigation, we really can't comment any more on it other than what we have in the disclosure.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay.\nWalter Lynch: All right.\nSteve Fleishman: And then, Walter, on your year-end call, you had kind of hinted at a larger acquisition or more growth coming in your tuck-in acquisitions and the like? Should I assume that was the York deal the ended up officially getting announced? Or is that still relevant for something else?\nWalter Lynch: Let me approach from this, we continue to build our pipeline. We continue to, again, provide solutions for communities. And if you look over the last year, we have almost doubled our pipeline. We have the biggest acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. So we are going to keep doing much of the same, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Great. And then just on the New York American sale. If I understood you correctly, it sounds like neither your forecast nor your equity timing should be impacted at all by whatever happens with the outcome of the sale?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. That's correct, Steve.\nSteve Fleishman: Great. That was very clear. Thank you.\nWalter Lynch: Okay. Steve, thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Thank you.\nOperator: . Next question comes from Richard Sunderland, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning. Just maybe following up on that last point real quickly. The sale timing, would it impact where you land within the range of you 2021 guidance? Or phrased differently, you have some timing assumption associated with close presumably baked in/ Can you disclose what that assumption is and what a quarter or two difference may do to where you land link in the range?\nSusan Hardwick: Hi Rich. It's Susan. I am probably going to add much more detail to that. I would just echo what Walter said in his prepared remarks and in his answer a minute ago. We just don't see it having any impact on 2021.\nRichard Sunderland: Fair enough. Thank you. And then just separately curious at a high level in terms of your O&M efficiency ratio. What impacts you have seen on your efforts there over the past year under the pandemic and what that may mean for progress and efficiencies going forward as we reopen?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. It's been a big focus for us, as you know, Rich. And we are going to continue to focus on every area of our business where we can drive efficiencies. We have improved it from 34.5% to 34.1%, as I said in my remarks. And we are confident that we can hit our goal in 2025 of 30.4%. So we are going to continue to do the things that we have been doing, focusing on technology, leveraging our supply chain and really leveraging our culture of looking for every dollar that we can save and continue to provide the service that our customers expect. So that's the journey we are on. We are going to continue to execute on that. And we are confident in our goal in 2025.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Rich.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Verity Mitchell of HSBC. Please go ahead.\nVerity Mitchell: Hi. Good morning everyone. And I have just got another couple of high level questions about geography, which is something I am always interested in. When I look at your coverage across so many states, does the Biden proposal change the view of your opportunities across states? I mean, you have already said that it's not going to change your growth trajectory. But any nuance there? And also in terms of what we see in terms of major regulatory mechanisms in states now that you would like to see? Thank you.\nWalter Lynch: Yes. Hello Verity. Walter here. Yes. The administration's proposed plan does not change our outlook at all on acquisitions. Again, we continue to build our pipeline of opportunities. We are providing meaningful solutions and really when you look at the size of our business, how long we have been in business since 1886 and the expertise that we have and the ability to share costs across our customer base, we bring tremendous value to communities and they realize that. And that's why they are talking to us about potentially selling their water and wastewater systems.\nVerity Mitchell: Yes. So I just want to know whether the states in which you are active, the Biden proposals create new opportunities in particular states?\nWalter Lynch: I am not sure it will create new opportunities. The great thing is, it really talks about water and wastewater where before we were always left out. And I think is a realization in this country that there is so much fragmentation, so many improvements that need to be made that the private sector and American Water can play a really integral role in moving that forward. And that's what we are excited about.\nVerity Mitchell: And so what's missing in this? What would you like to see that's missing in terms of fair value or surcharges? What missing there?\nWalter Lynch: Yes. We continue to work with states on fair market value legislation. As I said, Kentucky is now the 11th state within our footprint to have fair market value legislation. It's really an affirmation of the value that we provide and I think the recognition of the legislatures and the governors that they want us to play a role in consolidating the market and adding our expertise to many of these small system that don't quite have the expertise. So we do have in the appendix an overview of fair market value by state and the specific parts of the fair market value. So refer to that and you can see, again, 11 out of our 16 states have fair market value legislation and we are going to continue to work with states that don't have it and continue to work to tell our story about the values we can provide.\nVerity Mitchell: Great. Thanks.\nWalter Lynch: Okay. Thank you Verity.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Now I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Walter Lynch for closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nWalter Lynch: Thank you for joining our call today. We appreciate and value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients. We hope our open and transparent discussions give you confidence in our company and the investment of our stock. As a reminder, our Virtual Annual Shareholders Meeting will be held next week on May 12 at 10:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time. We hope that you will join us. In the meantime, if you have any additional questions, please call the IR team and we will be happy to answer them. Thanks again and be safe.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks Walter. Let's start on slide 13 with a bit more detail on the results. As Walter highlighted, first quarter 2021 earnings were $0.73 per share compared to $0.68 per share in the first quarter 2020. Results for the regulated business segment were $0.74 per share, an increase of $0.06 per share, primarily driven by continued growth from infrastructure investment, acquisition and organic growth. Results for the market-based business were $0.09 per share, a decrease of $0.03 per share as we saw an increase in claims in the homeowner services group, due largely to weather-related events. Parent company results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020. Moving on to slide 14. Regulated results increased $0.06 per share. As I said, we saw $0.19 per share increase in revenues from new rates in effect, as well as earnings from acquisitions. O&M expense increased by $0.08 per share and somewhat offsetting was an increase in depreciation of $0.05 per share in support of growth in the business. As previously mentioned, the market-based business results decreased $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2021 as compared to the first quarter of 2020. The lower results were due to increased claims expense which was driven by extreme cold weather, primarily in Texas and Illinois and the continuation of stay at home activity that we saw throughout most of 2020 due to the pandemic. The parent results improved $0.02 per share in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of last year. The improved results were largely driven by a number of small items that increased expenses in the first quarter of 2020, offset by higher interest expense to support growth in the regulated business. Good morning Thanks Durgesh. Julien. I might just add on that point. In addition to what Walter said, we did see a little bit higher claims in the quarter from these weather-related events. We did see some water claims, particularly in Texas, Illinois and a few of the parts of the country, really driven by the extreme weather that occurred. And we would expect, of course, that to now sort of be over. Some of the wastewater claims that Walter's talking about, as long as we continue this bit more stay at home, we may see elevated claims there. But I think the exposure to the weather-related, we have isolated in this quarter. It's really not too material now. And we saw roughly a penny or so of that impact related to the stay at home activity in this quarter. And as you can see across the country, states are starting to loosen up. So there will be some return. So I certainly think we will see this start to mitigate. And in any event, we don't see it as material for the year. Thanks Julien. Insoo, maybe let me just comment on the equity needs, because that was a follow-on part of your question, I think. When we built our plan and laid out our financing plan over the five years, we anticipated an increase in our growth from acquisition and we reflected that at Analyst Day. Now whether or not we have identified these specific transactions, that's a different question. But we had anticipated a step-up in growth and built our plan accordingly. So long answer to your question, I don't see any change from these specific acquisitions that we have now highlighted, any change to our equity financing timing or any of other our financing plans over the course of the five years. No. It's beyond 2021. At Analyst Day, I think we indicated that there is about $700 million of equity in the five years and it's still roughly in sort in the middle of that five year timeframe. So no, I would not anticipate anything in 2021. Thanks Insoo. . Hi Steve. Thank you. Hi Rich. It's Susan. I am probably going to add much more detail to that. I would just echo what Walter said in his prepared remarks and in his answer a minute ago. We just don't see it having any impact on 2021. Thanks Rich."

            "name": "Walter Lynch",
            "content": "Thanks Ed. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. Before we move to quarter results, let me speak for a moment about our recent growth news. As you know, a key part of our strategy is to operate in states where we can best serve customers, drive efficiencies and continue to grow our regulated business. Recall that earlier in the year, we announced the sale of our Michigan operation and as you know in late 2019, we announced the sale of our New York operation. This slide shows what our new regulated service territory will look like after the announced transactions are completed. Moving to slide six. We recently announced what will be the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. On April 6, we signed an agreement to acquire the wastewater treatment and collection system for the City of York, Pennsylvania. This agreement will add an equivalent customer connection total of more than 45,000. As part of the agreement, Pennsylvania American Water will also continue to provide contracted wholesale waste water treatment and disposal for seven surrounding communities of York. We look forward to developing strong relationships that meet the needs of all customers, including those outside the city. Thanks Susan. Before we move on to your questions, in April, we were very proud to issue our first annual Inclusion & Diversity Report. This report highlights the efforts we have undertaken and the strides we made advancing our commitment to inclusion and diversity. ESG is a journey and our I&D Report is another way that shows how we are constantly striving thanks for the contributions of every employee to build and inclusive and mutual respect in the workplace. To launch this report internally, we were honored to have Mr. Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson join us virtually for conversation on inclusion, diversity and on allyship. Additionally, we had an incredible community healing discussion with our employees to provide a chance for even more open and honest dialogue on inclusion. We believe that a company's strength is it's people and the diversity of our workforce makes us even stronger. With that, we are happy to take your questions. Good morning Durgesh. Yes. That's right, Durgesh. We are still working through with, as I said in prepared remarks, still working through with staff and others. And we are hoping to be expecting this year. Yes. It's specific to our New York City Metropolitan operations in HOS. That's exactly right, Durgesh. No, not at this point. Again, we continue to work in cooperating the investigation. Yes. Durgesh, let me start with, we are really happy that the administration is focusing on water and wastewater as part of the infrastructure plan. So we like the attention that the industry is getting. And we think that the plan will benefit our customers, primarily by having access to low interest financing that's part of the plan. And so we access it right now on the water side. We want to get access on the wastewater side. That's a growing segment of our business and we want our customers to benefit like others from the low interest loans. So overall, we are very excited about the program and we want to participate like the municipalities do on the wastewater side. Well, as we have said and I have said in my remarks, there is significant need out there in the water and wastewater side. For us, it's not going to change our plan. Our pipeline continues to grow. We are going to continue to provide meaningful solutions for communities and we are committed to our plan. We don't see any change to our plan going forward. Thanks Durgesh. Yes. Julien, thanks for the question. We think there is going to be a lot more focus on PFAS in this administration. I know they formed a task force, I believe it was last week, to look at what are the next steps to establish an MCL. Right now, there is a health advisory limit of 70 parts per trillion and we think that there is going to be a lot more focus on it. So we will have to wait-and-see. But the EPA is really science-driven. They may want to make sure it's based on science. And I think there is going to be a coming together of the science and the need to establish an MCL. And we look forward to participating and working with the administration to establish that. That's right. That's all part of this work that's going to be going on. Yes. With the HOS business, we are seeing higher claims on the wastewater side. People are spending more time in their homes and that's causing families additional breaks that we are having to repair. And then on the partnership side, we have seen a little bit of a slowdown in those partnerships. Yet, we still have a really good pipeline of opportunities. So those are the two areas, I think, that a been somewhat impacted by the pandemic in our business going forward. Thanks Julien. Well, first, let me talk about the growth. And we are really excited for these two acquisitions in our two biggest states. It's all part of what we are doing in providing solutions for communities with the City of York on the wastewater side and then Egg Harbor City. In the first WIPA, that's really important, the first WIPA acquisition and we are hopeful many other communities are going to see the benefits of that and continue to sell their systems to New Jersey American Water and Pennsylvania American Water. But it's really about providing meaningful solutions. And again, as we have talked about having consolidated tariffs and the ability to spread those costs across a big customer base, over 700,000 customer connections, really helps those communities to mitigate and minimize customer bill impact. So that's a competitive advantage of ours. It's part of our strategy to make sure that these communities understand the value that we can bring to them through investment and I want the spotlight the follow on investment and how significant that is to our growth and to providing solutions for communities. So we are really excited about these two acquisitions and how they are going to play into future growth in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Yes. We do a constant assessment of where we are operating, where can we provide the best value for customers and where can we grow our systems. And we will continue to evaluate our footprint. But we are really happy where we are right now and we continue to grow. If you look at our pipeline, we are growing. We have eight states where we have 32 agreements. So it's not just in one or two or three states. It's really across our footprint. And we will continue to provide solutions again for communities across our footprint. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, Steve. And given that it is an ongoing investigation, we really can't comment any more on it other than what we have in the disclosure. All right. Let me approach from this, we continue to build our pipeline. We continue to, again, provide solutions for communities. And if you look over the last year, we have almost doubled our pipeline. We have the biggest acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history. So we are going to keep doing much of the same, Steve. Yes. That's correct, Steve. Okay. Steve, thank you. Yes. It's been a big focus for us, as you know, Rich. And we are going to continue to focus on every area of our business where we can drive efficiencies. We have improved it from 34.5% to 34.1%, as I said in my remarks. And we are confident that we can hit our goal in 2025 of 30.4%.

So refer to that and you can see, again, 11 out of our 16 states have fair market value legislation and we are going to continue to work with states that don't have it and continue to work to tell our story about the values we can provide. Okay. Thank you Verity. Thank you for joining our call today. We appreciate and value your participation and the work you do on behalf of your clients.

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the Company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Maureen Duffy, Senior Vice President of Communications. Ms. Duffy, you may begin.\nMaureen Duffy: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. I'm filling in today for Aaron, who is a bit under the weather. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the fourth quarter earnings release and in our 2022 Form 10-K, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will comment on our successful 2022 and our longer-term performance expectations and shareholder value. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our 2022 financial results in more detail, provide an update on acquisition activity and we'll close with a review of our outlook for 2023 and beyond, including financing plans. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan rate base growth expectations and active general rate cases before concluding with some ESG recognition we recently received. We will then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Maureen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for join us today. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2022 with strong financial results that were just ahead of our plan. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $4.51 per share for the year, which included $0.06 per share of favorable weather we had previously discussed. Excluding weather, earnings of $4.45 per share were just above the midpoint of the guidance range we shared originally back in November of 2021. Think about what has occurred globally since November of 2021, including widespread inflation, interest rates on a significant climb upward, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and many people are returning to the office as the world began to stabilize following recurring waves of COVID outbreak. When I reflect on how much has changed in the world since November of 2021, I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we shared 1.5 years ago. I'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver and especially over the last few months during an active and better cold storm season across the country. I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses and communities. You can see here on Slide 5, a checklist of some of our key accomplishments in 2022, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors and analysts is that our strong execution in 2022, amid a challenging backdrop, coupled with our clear capital growth plan, it demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we can execute our plans in '23 and beyond and the great -- with the great momentum we have from 2022. Turning to Slide 6. As you can see, we have delivered an exceptional total shareholder return over the past five years, including a growing record of significant dividend increases. We're very proud of this history, which also compares favorably on a three-year look back for TSR. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and water utility stocks in general did not perform as well in 2022 compared to the broader utility sector. Valuations of high PE stocks fell rapidly in the first half of 2022 as actual and expected interest rate hikes changed the landscape of investment opportunities. As a result, the PE multiple gap that had greatly expanded between water utilities and electric and gas utilities in recent years narrowed in 2022, all of that while we continued our very strong performance. This chart shows clearly the impact of the macro environment we have been in and how it affected valuation without regard to specific performance. And as we've seen so far in 2023, this revaluing of the market has stabilized as many other macroeconomic drivers have stabilized, including interest rates. If this continues to hold true, I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will drive shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for many years to come, which takes us to Slide 7. The comments that we'll share today are an affirmation of the financial plan, targets and guidance we laid out last November. Later, John will recap the drivers for growth in 2023, but big picture, we believe the combination of our EPS growth, our strong dividend, and ESG premium, and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from others in the utility sector. I'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2027 in our five-year plan and beyond. This is primarily, of course, due to significant investments in infrastructure and regulated acquisitions. And we get further into the plan, see the full effect on earnings from the increased capital spending and continue our track record of success in the regulatory arena we will deliver on our earnings growth plan and within the target range. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover more detail on 2022 financial results, our '23 outlook and our financing plans. John?\nJohn Griffith: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. I'll start by providing more details on our financial results for the year. In 2022, earnings were $4.51 per share compared to $6.95 per share in 2021. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 results included a gain of $2.70 per share from the sale of Homeowner Services and the $0.19 per share contribution to the American Water Charitable Foundation from the proceeds of the sale. Excluding this net gain in 2021, earnings grew by $0.26 per share in 2022. Earnings on infrastructure investment were the key driver of the growth. In 2022, we saw an increase of $0.89 per share related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, as discussed last quarter, weather was favorable by an estimated $0.06 per share in 2022 and $0.04 net year-over-year due primarily to warmer and drier conditions in 2022. Revenues in 2022 were favorable to plan for the year due to healthy organic demand and favorable and timely rate case execution in addition to the favorable weather. These factors, combined with expense management and lower pension costs as compared to plan, helped offset the impacts of inflation we earned in 2022. Specifically, O&M and other expense increased by $0.31 per share year-over-year with an estimated $0.23 of inflationary costs on chemicals, power and other fuel and higher interest rates. O&M and other also increased due to interest expense on new debt, state-level revenue taxes and insurance. Depreciation expense also increased $0.14 per share in support of growth in the regulated businesses. And as a reminder, 2021 results included $0.12 per share of operating earnings from our former New York subsidiary. The other operating segment results decreased in 2022 as the $0.31 per share of operating earnings from HOS in 2021 was mostly offset by $0.24 per share of earnings in 2022 from interest income and revenue share agreements. Finally, I want to note that we have a slide in the appendix that provides some additional details on fourth quarter results, which were also on plan. Turning to Slide 10. You'll see that in 2022, we had a strong year of business development growth as we closed on $335 million of acquisitions, which represents 70,000 customer connections across seven states. I think it's worth pausing for a minute to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work it takes across our state teams in collaboration with our corporate team to develop these opportunities, execute purchase agreements and most importantly, close on such a sizable number of acquisitions. The final statistics on any one calendar year's worth of acquisitions are often the result of many years of groundwork. We are confident we are the right choice for communities and search of solutions to their challenges, and we will continue to drive that vision. We are set up well for 2023 to be a strong year for growth through acquisitions. To start the year, we had $326 million of signed purchase agreements across nine states, which includes the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania, we talked about last quarter. The integration work to add Butler's customers, operations and employees on to the American Water platform is progressing as planned. We expect to close on that acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory approval and look forward to serving these new customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous across our footprint. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. Moving to a discussion of our financial health. On Slide 11, we provide a summary of our strong financial condition as we head into 2023. As a sign of continued financial strength, both S&P and Moody's have recently affirmed our credit ratings of single A and Baa1, respectively, and with a stable outlook for both. We believe our debt maturity levels, along with our planned debt issuances, are very manageable. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is important to minimize interest rate risk in a rising rate environment. I expect us to continue to issue fixed-rate long-term debt to protect against interest rate volatility. For total debt to capital, which at year-end was just above our target of 60% or less, we expect a meaningful decrease in 2023 when we issue equity. And finally, on liquidity, we continue to remain confident that we will have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. Moving on to Slide 12. As Susan mentioned, we are affirming our earnings guidance for 2023 in the range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. With our record of execution, we are confident in our ability to achieve our earnings expectations for 2023. The factors behind our 2023 guidance and long-term outlook are consistent with our messaging when we initiated 2023 guidance in November of 2022. This year's growth builds on the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth in November of 2021, which is driven by capital investment to serve our customers. Recent acquisitions that are being incorporated into active rate cases or just completed rate cases will also drive revenue and earnings growth this year. The regulatory solutions we pursued in our recent cases and are pursuing in our active cases such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms are closely aligned with the interest of our -- of regulators and customers. This approach helps to manage affordability and limit variability of customer bills, which ultimately aligns with our investors' interests as well. We are confident that we have in place regulatory solutions for over 75% of the elevated costs we anticipate in the near term, including certain production costs, interest and pension costs. As it relates to pension costs, with our year-end pension obligation re-measurement completed, we now know the pension expense for 2023, and it is fully reflected in our unchanged 2023 EPS guidance range. Finally, 2023 results will benefit from MSG's successful addition of its first Navy contract that we announced last summer, which will be fully transitioned in March of this year. Moving on to our financing plan. We continue to expect to issue an estimated $2 billion of equity from 2023 through 2027. Consistent with our prior messaging, subject to market conditions, we plan to raise a significant portion of the total planned equity in 2023. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of planned equity not completed in 2023 is expected to be issued near the end of the current five-year plan. As we've said for several quarters now, we expect equity will be a regular financing tool to fund incremental growth in the investment plan and to maintain a strong balance sheet. We also continue to expect to raise capital annually in the debt markets, including later this year. On Slide 13, we are affirming some more specifics regarding the key drivers for 2023 that I just discussed. These drivers are also generally consistent with what we shared last quarter, and demonstrate the importance of our ongoing regulatory execution. Recent new revenue in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois, together with infrastructure surcharge mechanisms account for a significant majority of the $1.10 to $1.20 per share revenue increase in 2023 shown on this slide, also reflected on the financing plans we expect to execute in 2023 that I just reviewed. Wrapping up on Slide 14, I'll echo Susan on how we drive our growth strategy and our operating plans to achieve our company's targets and goals. For the communities we already serve and the communities we hope to serve in the future, the capital investment needs that are required to deliver more sustainable water and wastewater services are very large. It's up to us to find ways to balance these investment needs with the affordability of services for our customers. As you've heard today, we are affirming our long-term earnings and dividend growth targets and our other long-term financial targets remain unchanged. We believe our 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth targets are compelling and maintain our position in the top tier of growth in the industry. The combination of our growth outlook, supported by our significant yet low-risk capital investment plan, as well as our ESG leadership premium and constructive position on affordability should continue to be rewarded by investors. Based upon this and our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our CapEx and rate base growth plan, rate case updates, and more on ESG. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 16, I want to start by acknowledging that our entire company did an excellent job of safely executing on our accelerated capital plan and safely performing our day-to-day work in 2022. While we didn't reach our ultimate goal of zero injuries, we did record our best year ever in terms of safety performance. That's quite an achievement since 2022 was also a record year of total investment in American Water, and we experienced some extreme weather conditions. We slightly exceeded our $2.5 billion goal for the year by making prudent investment decisions across our footprint and by acquiring many new systems, which John spoke about earlier. Looking ahead to 2023, and as we told you in November, we increased our investment plan this time to $2.9 billion overall and roughly $2.5 billion for capital expenditures. This will likely be our new annual threshold for the next few years. Coupled with detailed project plans, we expect this pace of investment to drive improvements in water quality and reliability for the benefit of our customers. These investments also generate significant economic benefit to the local and regional economies while improving the environmental compliance of the systems and the communities. These investments should also favorably impact our pipe replacement cycles, which are much better than the industry average. Taken together, these actions demonstrate how the values of ESG are integrated into our everyday work. Turning to Slide 17. I won't spend much time here, but this graph simply illustrates the result of our continued execution on capital investments. The combination of infrastructure projects and acquisitions is succeeding in growing our rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth as we make prudent investments in our systems with constructive regulatory outcomes. Let's move to Slide 18 and review the major components of our 10-year capital investment expenditure plan. Our focus continues to be infrastructure renewal at 68% to 70% of the plan through 2032. These investments are primarily for pipe replacement and upgrading water and wastewater treatment facilities. We also expect to allocate 10% to 12% of our capital expenditures to resiliency in order to harden our systems, improve cyber and physical security, and address climate variability. This allocation has increased over where we've been historically. Our resiliency has been tested over the past few months with floods in California and the bitter cold temperatures in many of our service territories over this past holiday season. As Susan said earlier, our systems and our teams did a great job of weathering the storms and preventing any major service disruptions during these recent events. It shouldn't be lost on our investors or other stakeholders that our employees in the field have the best skills, training and expertise in the industry, which leads to these great results when we're tested. Our commitment to make needed investments to enhance water quality remains very strong, including steps we're taking to improve our comprehensive source water protection programs and upgrade our treatment facilities. Every water provider must be prepared to address a broader range of contaminants and be ready to meet more stringent regulations. Finally, we'll continue to invest in new technologies to enhance our customer experience and enable our employees to drive efficiencies. Overall, our capital plan is very much aligned with our environmental goals and other ESG-related values that we prioritize as a company. Let's go to Slide 19 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on this slide is a summary of pending or recently completed general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure surcharges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states. As Susan alluded to in her comments earlier, for us, the ability to execute on our regulatory strategies is a critical success factor for continuing to grow our business every year. However, we know that customer affordability is especially online of many utility investors and analysts heading into 2023, a topic I'll speak more about in a few minutes. Because of these concerns, we believe our constructive rate case outcomes in 2022 should be tangible evidence of the support we have from regulators for needed infrastructure investments to deliver high-quality service to our customers. The common thread in all of these general rate cases is the focus on recovery of infrastructure investments made since the last round of cases totaling over $4 billion, and in some states, the rolling of acquisitions. As we said, though, there are infrastructure mechanisms in several of our states that are reducing the lag of regulatory recovery. This works alongside our time frame between general rate cases of about two years in our bigger states. Turning briefly to active rate cases. Our cases in California and Missouri were filed in July and are progressing as expected so far. In January of 2023, we filed an update in Missouri for costs and other needed elements of the case with hearings to be held this month. We expect the case to reach conclusion by the end of the second quarter of 2023. In California, we recently applied for a Water Resources Sustainability Plan, which is an update to the general rate case. This plan requests the continuation of a decoupling mechanism that stems from legislation the governor recently signed that allows the California Public Utilities Commission to consider a decoupling mechanism. We believe decoupling is a ratemaking strategy that's good for both our customers and for the environment because it rewards customers for conserving water as we make investments to renew and improve our drinking water infrastructure. The filing has also been updated with more timely customer demand estimates and to reflect present rates approved by the commission, effective January 1, 2023. The application itself includes infrastructure renewals, wildfire mitigation, climate resiliency efforts and strengthening affordability programs in addition to the new Water Resources Sustainability Plan. And in Virginia, we have a settlement on file and expect a final decision in the first quarter of 2023. On the regulatory front outside of general rate cases, there were a few notable developments since our third quarter call. Staying in California and relating to the Monterey Water Supply Project, in November, the Coastal Commission approved our desalination coastal development permit application after many years of community discussion and in light of some additional commitments from us to the community. Then in December, the California Public Utilities Commission issued its decision that authorizes us to enter into an amended water purchase agreement and addressed rate recovery for the associated facilities. Subsequently, we filed an application for rehearing, requesting inclusion of all infrastructure costs in the cost cap for the groundwater replenishment project expansion and requested AFUDC that was not included in the decision. We are awaiting a ruling on our application. American Water is committed to being a solutions provider to the communities in Monterey County, both through the advances in the water supply project and through maintaining our current level of operations in the area. Just last month, several communities in Monterey were impacted by evacuations due to flooding that occurred there. Because of our amazing employees and reliable assets, California American Water maintained normal service to its customers during this challenging time. Finally, in California, we're still awaiting a ruling from the commission on the pending cost of capital case. Switching gears to Pennsylvania. Last month, the Department of Environmental Protection issued a maximum contaminant standard for two PFAS chemicals. Based on our proactive testing, we've identified one American Water location in Pennsylvania that requires action based on the new regulations. The treatment upgrade for that facility was already in process and is anticipated to be online later this year. In the meantime, we've taken the contaminated well out of service temporarily to manage PFAS levels in the water provided to our customers and ensure early compliance with the new regulations. We are still awaiting the new U.S. EPA standards, which we anticipate will be delivered later this year. We've already performed significant testing and analysis across our systems in compliance with state level guidance and have been acknowledged for that work, which will help inform our action plans when the EPA issues its standards. For example, our Short Hill Station project in New Jersey was completed to meet New Jersey state regulations and was recognized with the Governor's Environmental Excellence Award in 2020 for its leadership in water treatment related to PFAS removal. Broadly, we believe we are the leaders in the industry on this topic, as evidenced by our work with the Water Research Foundation on PFAS communications and other projects. Our research scientists are frequently invited by the EPA, Maybrook, AWWA, and the Water Research Foundation to speaking engagements that inform stakeholders and colleagues in the water industry. Finally, we were honored to be the only private utility invited to a recent event at the White House focusing on reducing lead exposure, replacing both the companies' and customers' portions of lead service lines is a part of our current capital plan. Our goal is to replace a significant majority of known lead service lines in our service areas by the year 2030. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 20 that we have $416 million in annualized new revenues and rates since January of 2022. This includes $308 million from general rate cases and step increases and $108 million from infrastructure surcharges. We have $181 million of total annualized revenue request pending, which includes two infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Throughout the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to cover infrastructure investments and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for growth in the business. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in obtaining constructive outcomes as we did in 2022. On Slide 21, as I mentioned earlier, customer affordability is front and center in the utility industry in 2023. One of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Thankfully, as we now have another full year's data to reflect on, our company is still in a very good relative position in terms of affordability or wallet share at less than 1% of median household income. We continue to believe that our affordability proposition is an important differentiator. And finally, on Slide 22, I'd like to highlight an ESG story that is a bit different than others than the others we have shared this past year. We're proud to say that American Water earns the SAFETY Act Designation from the Department of Homeland Security in 2022, the first water and wastewater company to do so. Not only is this great recognition of the work we do every day to keep our employees and community safe, but it also gives us the opportunity to strengthen our processes and increase knowledge sharing with the U.S. government. So with that, I'll turn it back over to the operator and begin Q&A and take any questions you may have.\nOperator: At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Maybe starting with the equity update. I know you reiterated a similar language to 3Q, but just -- now that we're getting into 2023, I just wanted to see if there was anything else you could share on kind of timing your message as we're into the calendar year now.\nSusan Hardwick: Rich, thanks for the question. I'll ask John to comment on that.\nJohn Griffith: Rich, no update in terms of timing. We'll issue the bulk of the $2 billion in 2023. And then whatever we don't issue in '23, we'll issue in the back end of our 2023 to 2027 plan period.\nRichard Sunderland: Okay. Got it. Very clear. And then you noted the stabilizing chemical costs, and I see the differences in the '23 walk from 3Q and then the current tech. But just is that really the -- looking at, I think, is a $0.01 revision there on the total range. Is that really the change you're seeing versus initial assumptions? I guess, what I'm really getting at is across that intention, any kind of movement within the guidance range now that you have final marks and more line of sight on the chemicals front relative to your initial outlook?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Rich, I'd say no change from what we've previously discussed, both in terms of our results in '22 and expectations for '23. As we talked last quarter, pretty successful in the regulatory arena to really mitigate most of that exposure going into '23. And now that we finished our pension re-measurement, as John commented on, certainly anticipate no change to our guidance relative to that issue.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.\nGregg Orrill: To follow-up on the equity, just how does that position you for incremental acquisitions? Is there sort of any element of prefunding there? And then if there's a follow-up, just on the rate base, how did that come in for 2022 versus your expectation? And how does that -- if it's different, how does that impact your guidance going forward?\nSusan Hardwick: Let me take the first -- or the second part of that first. No surprises relative to rate base as we ended the year. And again, as we look out really into this five-year period, don't expect any changes from what we've previously shown you around rate base. And John, you want to comment on the equity question?\nJohn Griffith: Sure. Greg, I would just say that the amount of equity that we're raising and the cadence of the equity does capture the various scenarios that we've run around regulated acquisitions.\nOperator: Thank you. And this concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference call has now concluded as well. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Maureen, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for join us today. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2022 with strong financial results that were just ahead of our plan. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $4.51 per share for the year, which included $0.06 per share of favorable weather we had previously discussed. Excluding weather, earnings of $4.45 per share were just above the midpoint of the guidance range we shared originally back in November of 2021. Think about what has occurred globally since November of 2021, including widespread inflation, interest rates on a significant climb upward, Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and many people are returning to the office as the world began to stabilize following recurring waves of COVID outbreak. When I reflect on how much has changed in the world since November of 2021, I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we shared 1.5 years ago. I'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver and especially over the last few months during an active and better cold storm season across the country. I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses and communities. You can see here on Slide 5, a checklist of some of our key accomplishments in 2022, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors and analysts is that our strong execution in 2022, amid a challenging backdrop, coupled with our clear capital growth plan, it demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we can execute our plans in '23 and beyond and the great -- with the great momentum we have from 2022. Turning to Slide 6. As you can see, we have delivered an exceptional total shareholder return over the past five years, including a growing record of significant dividend increases. We're very proud of this history, which also compares favorably on a three-year look back for TSR. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and water utility stocks in general did not perform as well in 2022 compared to the broader utility sector. Valuations of high PE stocks fell rapidly in the first half of 2022 as actual and expected interest rate hikes changed the landscape of investment opportunities. As a result, the PE multiple gap that had greatly expanded between water utilities and electric and gas utilities in recent years narrowed in 2022, all of that while we continued our very strong performance. This chart shows clearly the impact of the macro environment we have been in and how it affected valuation without regard to specific performance. And as we've seen so far in 2023, this revaluing of the market has stabilized as many other macroeconomic drivers have stabilized, including interest rates. If this continues to hold true, I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will drive shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for many years to come, which takes us to Slide 7. The comments that we'll share today are an affirmation of the financial plan, targets and guidance we laid out last November. Later, John will recap the drivers for growth in 2023, but big picture, we believe the combination of our EPS growth, our strong dividend, and ESG premium, and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from others in the utility sector. I'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2027 in our five-year plan and beyond. This is primarily, of course, due to significant investments in infrastructure and regulated acquisitions. And we get further into the plan, see the full effect on earnings from the increased capital spending and continue our track record of success in the regulatory arena we will deliver on our earnings growth plan and within the target range. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover more detail on 2022 financial results, our '23 outlook and our financing plans. John? Rich, thanks for the question. I'll ask John to comment on that. Yes. Rich, I'd say no change from what we've previously discussed, both in terms of our results in '22 and expectations for '23. As we talked last quarter, pretty successful in the regulatory arena to really mitigate most of that exposure going into '23. And now that we finished our pension re-measurement, as John commented on, certainly anticipate no change to our guidance relative to that issue. Let me take the first -- or the second part of that first. No surprises relative to rate base as we ended the year. And again, as we look out really into this five-year period, don't expect any changes from what we've previously shown you around rate base. And John, you want to comment on the equity question?"

            "name": "John Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. I'll start by providing more details on our financial results for the year. In 2022, earnings were $4.51 per share compared to $6.95 per share in 2021. Fourth quarter and full year 2021 results included a gain of $2.70 per share from the sale of Homeowner Services and the $0.19 per share contribution to the American Water Charitable Foundation from the proceeds of the sale. Excluding this net gain in 2021, earnings grew by $0.26 per share in 2022. Earnings on infrastructure investment were the key driver of the growth. In 2022, we saw an increase of $0.89 per share related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, as discussed last quarter, weather was favorable by an estimated $0.06 per share in 2022 and $0.04 net year-over-year due primarily to warmer and drier conditions in 2022. Revenues in 2022 were favorable to plan for the year due to healthy organic demand and favorable and timely rate case execution in addition to the favorable weather. These factors, combined with expense management and lower pension costs as compared to plan, helped offset the impacts of inflation we earned in 2022. Specifically, O&M and other expense increased by $0.31 per share year-over-year with an estimated $0.23 of inflationary costs on chemicals, power and other fuel and higher interest rates. O&M and other also increased due to interest expense on new debt, state-level revenue taxes and insurance. Depreciation expense also increased $0.14 per share in support of growth in the regulated businesses. And as a reminder, 2021 results included $0.12 per share of operating earnings from our former New York subsidiary. The other operating segment results decreased in 2022 as the $0.31 per share of operating earnings from HOS in 2021 was mostly offset by $0.24 per share of earnings in 2022 from interest income and revenue share agreements. Finally, I want to note that we have a slide in the appendix that provides some additional details on fourth quarter results, which were also on plan. Turning to Slide 10. You'll see that in 2022, we had a strong year of business development growth as we closed on $335 million of acquisitions, which represents 70,000 customer connections across seven states. I think it's worth pausing for a minute to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work it takes across our state teams in collaboration with our corporate team to develop these opportunities, execute purchase agreements and most importantly, close on such a sizable number of acquisitions. The final statistics on any one calendar year's worth of acquisitions are often the result of many years of groundwork. We are confident we are the right choice for communities and search of solutions to their challenges, and we will continue to drive that vision. We are set up well for 2023 to be a strong year for growth through acquisitions. To start the year, we had $326 million of signed purchase agreements across nine states, which includes the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania, we talked about last quarter. The integration work to add Butler's customers, operations and employees on to the American Water platform is progressing as planned. We expect to close on that acquisition by the end of 2023, pending regulatory approval and look forward to serving these new customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous across our footprint. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. Moving to a discussion of our financial health. On Slide 11, we provide a summary of our strong financial condition as we head into 2023. As a sign of continued financial strength, both S&P and Moody's have recently affirmed our credit ratings of single A and Baa1, respectively, and with a stable outlook for both. We believe our debt maturity levels, along with our planned debt issuances, are very manageable. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is important to minimize interest rate risk in a rising rate environment. I expect us to continue to issue fixed-rate long-term debt to protect against interest rate volatility. For total debt to capital, which at year-end was just above our target of 60% or less, we expect a meaningful decrease in 2023 when we issue equity. And finally, on liquidity, we continue to remain confident that we will have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. Moving on to Slide 12. As Susan mentioned, we are affirming our earnings guidance for 2023 in the range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. With our record of execution, we are confident in our ability to achieve our earnings expectations for 2023. The factors behind our 2023 guidance and long-term outlook are consistent with our messaging when we initiated 2023 guidance in November of 2022. This year's growth builds on the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth in November of 2021, which is driven by capital investment to serve our customers. Recent acquisitions that are being incorporated into active rate cases or just completed rate cases will also drive revenue and earnings growth this year. The regulatory solutions we pursued in our recent cases and are pursuing in our active cases such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms are closely aligned with the interest of our -- of regulators and customers. This approach helps to manage affordability and limit variability of customer bills, which ultimately aligns with our investors' interests as well. We are confident that we have in place regulatory solutions for over 75% of the elevated costs we anticipate in the near term, including certain production costs, interest and pension costs. As it relates to pension costs, with our year-end pension obligation re-measurement completed, we now know the pension expense for 2023, and it is fully reflected in our unchanged 2023 EPS guidance range. Finally, 2023 results will benefit from MSG's successful addition of its first Navy contract that we announced last summer, which will be fully transitioned in March of this year. Moving on to our financing plan. We continue to expect to issue an estimated $2 billion of equity from 2023 through 2027. Consistent with our prior messaging, subject to market conditions, we plan to raise a significant portion of the total planned equity in 2023. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of planned equity not completed in 2023 is expected to be issued near the end of the current five-year plan. As we've said for several quarters now, we expect equity will be a regular financing tool to fund incremental growth in the investment plan and to maintain a strong balance sheet. We also continue to expect to raise capital annually in the debt markets, including later this year. On Slide 13, we are affirming some more specifics regarding the key drivers for 2023 that I just discussed. These drivers are also generally consistent with what we shared last quarter, and demonstrate the importance of our ongoing regulatory execution. Recent new revenue in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Illinois, together with infrastructure surcharge mechanisms account for a significant majority of the $1.10 to $1.20 per share revenue increase in 2023 shown on this slide, also reflected on the financing plans we expect to execute in 2023 that I just reviewed. Wrapping up on Slide 14, I'll echo Susan on how we drive our growth strategy and our operating plans to achieve our company's targets and goals. For the communities we already serve and the communities we hope to serve in the future, the capital investment needs that are required to deliver more sustainable water and wastewater services are very large. It's up to us to find ways to balance these investment needs with the affordability of services for our customers. As you've heard today, we are affirming our long-term earnings and dividend growth targets and our other long-term financial targets remain unchanged. We believe our 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth targets are compelling and maintain our position in the top tier of growth in the industry. The combination of our growth outlook, supported by our significant yet low-risk capital investment plan, as well as our ESG leadership premium and constructive position on affordability should continue to be rewarded by investors. Based upon this and our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our CapEx and rate base growth plan, rate case updates, and more on ESG. Cheryl? Rich, no update in terms of timing. We'll issue the bulk of the $2 billion in 2023. And then whatever we don't issue in '23, we'll issue in the back end of our 2023 to 2027 plan period. Sure. Greg, I would just say that the amount of equity that we're raising and the cadence of the equity does capture the various scenarios that we've run around regulated acquisitions."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.  I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our September 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will discuss third quarter and year-to-date highlights and touch on 2023 guidance and our long-term targets.  John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our financial results in detail, will provide an update on active general rate cases and acquisition activity, and will close with further details on our 2023 and longer-term outlook, including the overall financing plan. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan, rate base growth expectations and our focus on affordability. Cheryl will then conclude with a review of some important new operating goals and disclosures that align with our focus on ESG. We'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Aaron said, we have a lot to discuss this morning in addition to third quarter results. And specifically, we also want to cover today our outlook for 2023 and our longer-term targets. As you know, last year, at this time, we shared some significant news when we sold our homeowner services business to transition to a pure-play regulated water and wastewater utility. In that update, we announced a new 5-year plan and acceleration of capital investments and some adjustments to our financial targets. The updates that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of last year's plan and targets with adjustments primarily reflecting the shift out to 2027 in our 5-year outlook. We will also share additional thoughts and plans around our continuing ESG journey. So let's dive in and turn to Slide #5, where I'll start by covering some highlights of 2022 to date. In the first 9 months of 2022, earnings were $3.70 per share compared to $3.40 per share in the same period of 2021. Strong organic growth and increased earnings from infrastructure investments continue to be our year-over-year drivers for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Favorable weather also added to results in the third quarter.  Though we generally, like others, are experiencing a higher cost environment, our team continues to deliver on our financial and operating plans. This includes staying on track to achieve our total capital investment goal of $2.5 billion in 2022 and executing on significant regulatory activities, including constructive settlements in 2 of our outstanding general rate cases. Further, we continue to effectively manage and mitigate cost increases and have been successful in recent regulatory efforts to further lessen the impact of inflationary pressures into the future. These regulatory solutions are very important to our ability to manage inflationary headwinds as we move into 2023. So I'm pleased that we've successfully executed our plan so far this year in a challenging and very active period. John and Cheryl will provide additional details on financial, operating and regulatory results later in today's call. But before I move on, let me comment about how excited we were to sign an agreement a few weeks ago to serve the nearly 15,000 customers of the Butler Area Sewer Authority in Western Pennsylvania. This is another great example of how partnerships with municipalities can lead to positive outcomes for customers, employees and the community at large. Our team worked very hard to understand the community's objectives and created an opportunity that we believe benefits all stakeholders. Turning to Slide 6. As announced yesterday, we affirmed our 2022 earnings guidance. We continue on track to meet our expectations for the year as we've indicated throughout the year. And in addition, we have had the incremental contribution from weather this quarter. Also yesterday, we initiated our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. This near-term plan as well as our longer-term plan remains very strong, and with our record of execution we are confident in our ability to achieve our earnings expectations for 2023.  Later, John will talk more about the drivers of our growth in 2023, but our expected growth builds on the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth last year. As we've said many times, the full effect on earnings growth from the increasing capital spending will ramp up over time. John will talk further about our updated financing plan, but this plan reflects our prior discussion that the growing investment plan will result in regular access to equity capital. As we've illustrated on this slide, we expect our investments in infrastructure and regulated acquisitions to drive significant earnings growth through 2017 and beyond. Finally, on Slide 7, I want to make a few comments about our purpose here at American Water and how that drives our growth strategy, our operating plans and our company's targets and goals. Our mission is to provide safe, clean, affordable and reliable water and wastewater services to the communities across the country. Our services are vital to sustaining life. So while much has said in the news about the clean energy transition that's happening, what drives us every day is an equally important need in our country. We believe that everyone should have access to safe, clean, affordable and reliable drinking water and wastewater services, and that communities are stronger because American Water has the privilege to serve them.  It's true that we have many similarities to the utilities, and we embrace the knowledge sharing and best practices that can come with those similarities. In fact, we joined EEI as a strategic partner a few years ago because of common values around customer service, safety and cybersecurity, to name just a few. And as many of you know, I've spent most of my career in the gas and the electric industry. So I have a deep appreciation for the utility industry as a whole. However, the water industry and American Water also have some important differences from other utilities. Our capital projects, for example, are much smaller on average than those in the electric and natural gas industries. Even though they add up to a similar and very significant investment need. Another difference is our greenhouse gas emissions footprint, which is very small compared to most other publicly traded electric and gas utilities.  That said, we are seeing the impacts that climate variability can have through more extreme droughts or more severe floods. We strongly believe we must do our part to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. We have now set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals, including achieving net 0 by 2050. Along with our goals for system resiliency, and water use and efficiency, we see our greenhouse gas reduction goals as part of our commitment to provide superior and affordable service to our customers. We believe American Water is the leader in a clean water and wastewater transition in the United States. For the communities we already serve and the communities we hope to serve in the future, the capital investment needs that are required to deliver more sustainable water and wastewater services are immense. It's up to us to find ways to balance those CapEx needs with the affordability of services for our customers. That's why we've added a customer affordability target to our list of key drivers you see here.  As a company, we also continue to raise the bar on our efforts to create a fair and equitable place to work in addition to making sure our operations align with the spirit of environmental justice. Two recent examples of our broad focus were the recognition through the 2022 WaterSense Excellence Award from the Environmental Protection Agency and the 2022 Leading Disability Employer by the National Organization on Disability. Cheryl will provide some examples later of the good things we are doing internally in these areas. Finally, on this slide, you can see we are affirming our long-term earnings growth targets, and most of our other long-term financial targets remain unchanged. During our planning process this fall, we decided to narrow our long-term dividend growth target to 7% to 9%, which maintains our position in the top tier of dividend growth and payout ratio in the industry. Our long-term dividend growth target now fully aligns with our compelling EPS growth target of 7% to 9% and the significance of our capital investment plan and related financing. This minor adjustment rounds out our strong long-term plan and will help us achieve our other important financial targets over time. In summary, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth supported by significant and yet low-risk capital investment plan as well as our ESG leadership premium and constructive position on affordability will continue to be rewarded by investors. Based on the long-term plan and our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover more detail on our 2022 financial results, our 2023 and longer-term outlook and our financing plans. John?\nJohn Griffith: Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. Let me provide a few more details on third quarter results. Regulated results in total increased $0.16 per share compared to the prior year. We saw a $0.32 per share increase related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, weather was favorable by an estimated $0.07 per share year-over-year due primarily to warmer and drier conditions in 2022.  O&M and other expense increased by $0.10 per share, which reflects an estimated $0.07 of inflation on chemical, power and fuel costs and higher interest rates. Depreciation expense also increased $0.04 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. And as you know, 2021 third quarter results included $0.09 per share of operating earnings from our former New York subsidiary. Finally, the market-based business and other results decreased in the third quarter of 2022 as the $0.09 per share of operating earnings from HOS in the third quarter of 2021 was offset by the $0 06 per share of earnings in 2022 from interest income and revenue share agreements. Moving to Slide 10. Consolidated results increased $0.30 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the third quarter. While I won't go through all of the details of the year-to-date results, in short, we are pleased with our financial performance over the first 9 months of the year.  Our leaders across the business have adjusted to the changing economic environment in 2022. Their ability to do so has put us in a good position to achieve the full year operating results we laid out in our initial 2022 guidance a year ago.  Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover the regulatory activity in our states. Shown here is our summary of completed rate cases in 2022 and key facts for each of the rate case filings so far this year. In the appendix, we also share some details of changes in our infrastructure charges year-to-date. These efforts reflect Susan's comment on our team's ability to execute our regulatory strategies, which is the critical success factor for continuing to grow our business. As we've said before, the common thread in all of these cases is the focus on recovery of infrastructure investments made since the last round of rate cases totaling over $4 billion, and in some states, the roll-in of acquisitions. As we continue to ramp up capital investments in 2023, it will take time to see recovery of those investments in rates. We continue to expect to file general rate cases generally every 2 years in our bigger states.  As we have already communicated in August 2022, the New Jersey BPU approved the settlement of our rate request authorizing a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $61 million. The new rates became effective on September 1, 2022. Two key outcomes in this case were the incorporation of our request to update estimates of production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs, and the approval of deferral accounting for pension expense beginning January 1, 2023. The success of our proactive regulatory approach to these pressures will lessen the risk to shareholders into the future. Turning back to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in 5 jurisdictions. In 2 of these states, Pennsylvania and Virginia, we have reached settlement agreements with the parties and have on-file petitions for approval of the settlements. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in late April, seeking recovery of $1.1 billion of investments since the prior case. The settlement provides for a total annualized revenue increase of $150 million and incorporates updated estimates of pension and OPEB expense.  Similar to New Jersey, this settlement also includes increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. In the coming weeks, an administrative law judge will review the settlement filing and render a recommendation to the Pennsylvania Commission regarding approval of the settlement. After its review, the commission will issue a final order. We expect the order by January 2023, with new rates to be effective as of January 28, 2023. Moving on to Virginia. In late September, a settlement agreement supported by all parties, except one, was filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and provides for a $12 million annual revenue increase compared to our original request of $15 million. A final decision in this case is expected in the first quarter of 2023.  In Illinois, where it's been about 6 years since our last general rate case, progress has been steady since our February filing, and last Friday, a proposed order was issued by the case's administrative law judges. We view the key terms of the proposed order as very constructive, including recommended approval of our updated revenue request to capture higher production costs and expected higher pension costs. We expect a final order in the case by January at the latest.  Our cases in California and Missouri were filed in July and are progressing as expected so far. In January of 2023, we will file an update in Missouri for costs and other elements of the case as needed with hearings then to be held in February. We expect the case to reach conclusion by the end of the second quarter 2023. On the legislative front, there was 1 additional notable piece of legislation signed since our second quarter call, California Senate Bill 1469, which allows the commission to consider and authorize the implementation of a decoupling like mechanism. The legislation was signed by the governor on September 30, 2022, and will become effective on January 1, 2023. Our California subsidiary is grandfathered into the previous water revenue adjustment mechanism through the end of our current rate case for 2024 and the team is working to renew decoupling under the new mechanism and the general rate case that was filed July 1 for our next rate period beginning in 2024.  Turning to Slide 12 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle, as Susan mentioned, we were excited to announce in October, our agreement to purchase the Butler Area Sewer Authorities Wastewater System for $232 million. This agreement was executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation, which is a framework that exists across 11 of the states in which we operate. Through September, we have closed on $308 million of acquisitions in 2022, which represents about 65,000 customer connections, and we are excited to have nearly $350 million of signed purchase agreements through October, which sets us up for 2022 and 2023 to be strong years for growth through acquisitions. With the pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections, we expect to continue this track record of success.  On Slide 13, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2023 results in our EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by capital investment to serve our customers and earning a return on that investment. As we've talked about previously, 2022 is year 1 of our accelerated CapEx plan, so it will take some time to ultimately see the ramp-up reflected in earnings. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year. I'd like to add that our Military Services Group does add incrementally to our earnings growth expectation as we have continued to show on our growth triangle. 2023 results will benefit from MSG's successful addition of its first Navy contract that we announced earlier this summer.  Just as critical to our strategy is our ability to recover in rates, the operating costs it takes to run the business, which goes to my final point on the slide. The regulatory solutions we are pursuing such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms are closely aligned with the interest of regulators and customers in managing affordability and limiting variability of customer bills, which ultimately aligns with our investors' interests as well. As we conclude this current round of rate cases, we expect to have in place regulatory solutions for over 75% of the inflationary costs we anticipate in the near term, including pension, interest and production costs. And as always, our team remains vigilant and disciplined on cost management. Finally, related to pension, I'd simply remind you that our pension obligation remeasurement will be done at year-end 2022 and that will drive the determination of our 2023 pension expense.  Wrapping up the 2023 outlook on Slide 14. Here, we are providing some more specifics regarding the key drivers for 2023 that I just discussed. This slide demonstrates the importance of our regulatory execution and the results it drives. It also reflects the financing plans we expect to execute in 2023 that support our capital investment plan, which is an additional $1 billion over the next 5 years as compared to last year's plan. You will notice that we have included a bar for incremental debt and equity financing, which reflects the cost of incremental debt issuance in 2023 to support our growth as well as equity to be issued in 2023, which I will address on the next slide. Our cost of increased interest rates on 2022 debt balances is captured in the cost inflation and interest rates bar, the majority of which is being recovered through the current round of rate cases as just described. We are confident in our ability to deliver on this plan for 2023.  Turning to Slide 15. I'll provide a financing plan update before closing with a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile. Our financing plan now includes an estimated $2 billion of equity issuances from 2023 through 2027, which is an update to the $1.1 billion of equity financing need through 2026 we have previously discussed.  Consistent with our prior messaging on mid-plan timing, subject to market conditions, we are likely to raise a significant portion of the total planned equity in 2023. The increase in the anticipated total equity need is driven largely by the $1 billion of increased CapEx that extends through 2027 in this new plan, along with adding some incremental balance sheet capacity. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of planned equity not completed in 2023 is expected to be issued near the end of the 5-year plan. As we've said for several quarters now, we expect equity will be a regular financing tool going forward to help fund our growth and maintain a strong balance sheet.  Let me conclude by turning to Slide 16 with a reminder that we have a strong balance sheet and credit profile. I'm confident our new 5-year plan is supportive of our current credit ratings as well as our long-term financial target of less than 60% debt to total capital. Another thing I'll point out is our debt maturity profile at the bottom left of the slide.  We believe these levels, along with our planned debt issuances are very manageable. In a rising interest rate environment, it's important that the company has taken a laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years in order to minimize interest rate risk. And as the utility that predominantly invests in long-term assets, I expect us to continue to exclusively issue fixed rate long-term debt to protect against the risk of interest rate volatility.  On liquidity, we continue to remain confident that we have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. In fact, we just announced that we increased our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility by $500 million each to $2.6 billion and $2.75 billion, respectively, and we extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to October 2027. We believe these actions were appropriate to support our growing business and increased capital investment plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our CapEx and rate base growth plan, affordability and some new sustainability goals in more detail. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 18, I'll start by talking about our updated capital plan. I want to first acknowledge that our teams have done a great job executing on our accelerated capital investment plan in 2022. We're on pace to meet our overall capital plan of $2.5 billion this year, which includes acquisition investments.  Looking ahead to 2023, we plan to again step up our investment level this time to roughly $2.9 billion, which will generally be our new annual threshold for the next several years. As John just mentioned, over the next 5 years, we expect to invest approximately $14 billion to $15 billion, an increase of about $1 billion over our previous plan. This increase is mostly driven by including the increased investment for 2027 in the 5-year window as well as about $250 million of inflationary impacts expected in the near term.  We expect this pace of spend to drive our current pipe replacement cycle plan lower and much better than the industry average. On the longer horizon, you can see that we plan to spend approximately $30 billion to $34 billion in our regulated business over the next 10 years. We see this capital plan to be largely in line with last year's plan, reflecting the higher annual run rate as well as modestly higher costs for pipe and other capital goods.  Turning to Slide 19. This graph illustrates that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions are succeeding and growing the regulated business at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth as long as we continue to prudently invest in our systems and successfully execute the regulatory process.  Moving on to our regulatory recovery strategy on Slide 20, our theme here is around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it levels out build increases to our customers, which helps promote affordability. It's beneficial to our customers that we operate in states that have constructive regulatory mechanisms. We've engaged with policymakers and regulators for well over a decade to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, while putting the customer first. In the states where we operate, 27 new mechanisms have been added over the past 12 years. As water and wastewater industry challenges grow, we'll continue to focus on constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes. I'd also like to discuss timely recovery of our investments across our footprint with the pie chart on the right side of the page. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we are able to reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This enables us not only to earn our return, but also to mitigate the size of the general rate increases for our customers. We expect about 45% of capital investments over the next 5 years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms, which is the key to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term.  Turning to Slide 21. Our focus on operating efficiency has been a part of our company's DNA for many years. As you know, we've historically used O&M efficiency as one of our benchmark metrics to measure our success at managing costs as we grow the business. This focus positioned us well to manage through much of the pressure over the last couple of years on the supply chain and even cost increases brought about by the effects of the pandemic.  As we look ahead, we've been asked if we can go below the 30% efficiency threshold. While we're continuing to evaluate that question, we've continued to emphasize that revenue growth has been just as important to our success with O&M efficiency as managing costs. So with that realization in mind, there may very well be additional opportunity to go below the 30% threshold. However, we're analyzing whether this is the best metric by which to judge our effectiveness at managing costs and running an efficient business. Moving to Slide 22. One of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Thankfully, as we sit here today, our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. In fact, as investors and analysts study the sustainability of American Water's long-term earnings growth potential, we believe our affordability proposition is an important consideration. We realize, though, that we must continue to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We must also consider our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and a sharp focus on cost management in order to deliver on values around customer affordability.  Moving on to Slide 23, and as Susan mentioned earlier, we are excited to announce our new science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and our first disclosure of estimated Scope 3 emissions. Before we dive in, I'll walk you through our greenhouse gas emissions profile in a bit more detail. As an essential service provider, American Water is often compared to the broader utility sector emissions included, which can be misleading. As Susan noted earlier, it's an important distinction that our emissions footprint as a water utility is much smaller than most publicly traded gas and electric companies on both an absolute and per customer basis. To help put it into context, American Water represents just 0.1% of the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions produced by the top 20 largest U. S. utilities measured by market cap.  As we show on the slide, our total emissions footprint is made up of 7% direct Scope 1 emissions, such as heating, cooling and fleet; 44% indirect Scope 2 emissions or our purchase power; and 49% estimated Scope 3 emissions, which for us largely includes purchased goods and services, capital goods and fuel and energy-related activities. Framing it in a different way, more than 90% of our overall emissions footprint is generated from external sources, which is another key differentiator from most other utilities.  Turning to Slide 24, there's a lot to unpack here. Let me say first, at a high level, we believe it is prudent for our company to focus our efforts on environmental initiatives that are in the purview of a water utility and aligned with our core mission. Our view is that greenhouse gas emission reductions fit as part of our sustainability strategy that, over time, will help protect customers against service disruptions from more severe weather patterns such as droughts and floods. We believe we've set forth new compelling goals to support this strategy. First, we expect to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 50% by 2035 from a 2020 baseline. Second, we expect to achieve net 0 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050. We believe these new medium- and long-term emissions goals are rooted in science and aligned with the Paris Agreement. We also believe our approach is a responsible path that considers all of our stakeholders' interest including doing our part by setting ambitious reduction goals. Our approach here will allow us to stay on course with our customer affordability metrics, as we continue to deliver clean, safe, affordable and reliable water to our customers. This was a foundational component of our analysis and recent discussion with our Board level SETO Committee, which oversees our safety, environmental, technology and operations efforts.  It's also important to note that as we deliver water and wastewater solutions to more customers over time through acquisitions and organic growth, our energy usage is going to increase. We will rebaseline each year to account for our growth through acquisitions of systems, which is an acceptable practice under the standards of the science-based targets initiative, or SBTi. We did consider making a commitment to SBTi as part of our analysis this year. However, we concluded that some of SBTi's expectations around Scope 3 commission commitments mostly around timing, we're not in the best interest of our stakeholders. We do expect, though, to continue to work with our suppliers and vendors to consider what can be done to reduce Scope 3 emissions over time. And as I stated, we are confident that our new medium- and long-term Scope 1 and Scope 2 goals are science-based and aligned with the Paris Agreement. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these are more than just goals. We have plans in place and capital ready to deploy to achieve these goals, obviously, with greater visibility to the path to 2035. Since our footprint is heavily weighted by Scope 2 emissions, the continued greening of the electric grid is a significant component of our reduction plan. We hope to see that transition continue by our fellow utilities and other providers. For us though, we know that it is cost prohibitive and outside of our core competencies to self-generate all or even a significant portion of our power needs. We will, though, continue to look to enter into clean purchase power agreements or partner on renewable investments, where appropriate, similar to our engagement with New Jersey Resources on the floating solar array at one of our treatment plants in New Jersey.  Lastly, we will continue to focus on emissions reduction activities that we can control within our operations. This includes water efficiency and operational efficiency gains in order to reduce the energy and emissions associated with the pumping of water, which we disclosed previously is by far the largest driver of our purchase power needs. Capital projects will include the deployment of additional leak detection technologies and more efficient water pumps across our systems as well as converting some of our fleet vehicles and other assets to more efficient options. These are small, but important pieces of our plan. And in large part, these capital investments will align perfectly with some of our existing reliability and resiliency goals. Next, let's turn to Slide 25 and discuss some new disclosures related to our continued ESG journey. First, soon, we will release summary results of our most recent pay equity study on our ID&E website, diversity@aw.com. This is our third such pay equity study. And each time we have engaged a third-party consultant to conduct an objective pay equity analysis. I'm pleased to share that you will see that we're very close to achieving pay parity across employee groups, including gender.  Our performance is a testament to American Water's commitment to fair and equal pay and how our teams have leveraged findings from these regular assessments to correct any qualities and update processes around compensation. We will also share some initial summary findings of our internal labor market analysis that began in 2021. This analysis was also led by a third-party firm and was commissioned because we believe the factual and statistical analysis of our workforce was needed to support a holistic evidence-based inclusion, diversity and equity strategy. Lastly, I'd like to touch on 2 of our new goals that were established earlier this year in our annual performance plan. The first is to increase representation of female employees at American Water and the second is to increase ethnic and racial diversity among American Water employees. Both of these goals complement existing safety and environmental sustainability goals that are tied to annual performance plan compensation for all employees. As mentioned earlier, these goals reflect our company's focus on social benefits that we believe will help us operate as a stronger company, ultimately for the benefit of our employees and to help us better reflect the customers and communities we serve. Whether it's our ESG leadership or our consistent execution on our earnings growth goals or our leading safety culture, our team at American Water has consistently raised the bar for success in the water and wastewater industry. We have full confidence in our ability to achieve the goal we talked about today for 2023 and beyond. So with that, I'll stop and turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.\nAngie Storozynski: So first on '23 guidance, I mean, I guess it's a relief for all of us to see that you're messaging to get to consensus expectations even with the increased basically equity needs that you're addressing in 2023. So I mean, is it basically that you are front-end loading equity to finance CapEx that will materialize in the latter part of that 5-year plan? And as such, it's not only that CapEx is back-end loaded, but it's also that there is some incremental dilution that sort of weighs on those '23 results?\nSusan Hardwick : Well, Angie, a lot in your question there, and let me maybe just comment at a high level, and then I'll have John jump in and talk a little bit more around -- our thinking around equity and the plan there. But recall from our, I guess, really the last few years, as we've talked about our equity needs and our expectation around that, we've been signaling sort of mid-plan and we released that guidance probably 2-plus years ago.  So I think this '23 timing now that we're giving a little bit more insight into is consistent with our prior messaging, the increase in the size of the equity that we now have in this plan, I think, as we've highlighted, really has to do with the increased capital over the course of the 5 years. And Cheryl indicated that we're kind of stepping up to roughly a $2.9 billion investment per year over that 5-year period. So there is more capital coming in throughout the entire 5-year focus of the plan. And then we've also added a little bit of additional equity expectation here just to create some additional balance sheet capacity as we think about that going forward.  The other important thing I would comment on around -- your opening comment around hitting expectations for '23. I just want to underscore again what we said in our prepared remarks around our regulatory approach to these inflationary costs. We have been very proactive in trying to get our hands around what we thought those impacts might be and we have worked very closely with regulators to try to build in, in these existing cases we're working on, the coverage for those costs. And I think we've said something well over 75% of those expected costs in the near term, we have built in these cases that we're ramping up now.  So I think I'd say, again, to summary, the equity plan is pretty much on track with what we've said historically and the increase in capital is driving the bulk of that need of additional equity in the plan. And then our proactive approach on regulatory is absolutely part of our ability to be confident about our expectations for '23. So John, anything to add on the equity piece?\nJohn Griffith : I would just add that as we think about how we're delineating the equity, as we said in our prepared remarks, we'll issue or we expect to issue a significant portion of the equity in 2023. As we think about the consequences of that, based on how we trade, I would characterize that the dilution associated with that is relatively modest. And then as also we pointed out in our remarks, whatever we don't issue in 2023, we would expect to issue in the back end of our plan.\nAngie Storozynski: Good. Okay. And then changing topics a little bit, and I know it's not your core competence. But you are a cash taxpayer, so you do have cash appetite, I mean, tax appetite, I'm sorry. So why not develop or at least own some of those renewable power plants that you currently contract under the PPAs. Again, as a tax strategy as opposed to like a true growth driver?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, I think it's a good question, Angie. But I think Cheryl hit on it and you did even in your remark there, we just don't view it as our core competency. There are folks that are sort of in that business, and we believe we have the opportunity to work closely with them to develop solutions and take advantage of those renewable sources that are out there without owning them. We've got enough to do. And you even acknowledge, it's not really a growth driver. We've got plenty to do on just our investment side to continue the growth. So we don't need it from that standpoint.  Your observation around tax, I think, is also a good one. But I would tell you, we think we have the right strategy here to finance this plan and manage all the elements of the requirements in that plan with what we've laid out here. So while we're always interested in and spend quite a bit of time on tax planning and tax strategy, it just does not -- it just doesn't fit our profile.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And last one really quickly. So you have had some big muni deals announced since the second quarter earnings call. I think we've all been concerned about some of those high profile privatizations of wastewater systems sort of falling through. So are you seeing that there is any sort of systemic change to how municipalities look at sales of their water and wastewater systems? Or is it just very much kind of system specific?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, Angie, let me just turn it to John and have him sort of weigh in on that question.\nJohn Griffith : Yes, Angie, I would say, I'm glad you asked the question because our answer is No. We haven't really seen a fundamental change in the landscape for making acquisitions. So there's certainly been some noise out there around particular deals. But really nothing has changed. There's a huge number of systems out there, many of which are underinvested and are ripe for potential acquisition. And when we think about the footprint that we have and the focus that we have, we continue to very much like our relative position there and regulated acquisitions will continue to be a key focus area for us.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. And I just would add to that simply that we work very hard in cultivating these opportunities to make sure we're developing the right solution for these communities, and I think that's a big advantage for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.\nShar Pourreza: A couple of quick ones here. If I recall correctly, the HOS sale ate up a lot of your, I think, NOL carry-forwards and you've been a cash taxpayer this year. Is it your expectation that you\u2019ll be subject to the minimum tax going forward? Does this latest financing plan kind of embed an ongoing assumption for that?\nSusan Hardwick : Well, the first part of your statement is correct. Yes. The gain on the HOS transaction sort of advanced us to being a cash taxpayer. Still evaluating what the IRA means and the alternative minimum tax and financial income greater than $1 billion. There's still lots to be sorted out in terms of what that final rules are and the final interpretation of those. So we're monitoring it closely. We've obviously modeled a variety of scenarios around it. And I would just say, in all those scenarios, this plan adequately covers any exposure we think we might have there.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. Okay. Perfect. And then I think John may have touched on this a little bit, but it looks like the amount of CapEx dollars allocated to regulated acquisitions is the same as the prior plans. So a slightly smaller overall proportion. Anything to sort of read into here? Is the opportunity set fairly fixed? Are you getting more selective? Just maybe a little bit of an elaboration on John's comments, please?\nSusan Hardwick : John, do you want to take that?\nJohn Griffith : Sure, Shar. I'd say the smaller proportionality is really just a function of the increase in the regulated -- our organic CapEx, I'd say the -- which has more visibility attached to it, as you know, than regulated acquisitions. So in no way are we kind of decreasing our thoughts around putting dollars to work on regulated acquisitions and we continue to feel very good about that.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. And I don't think we highlighted it really much on this call. But our pipeline remains in excess of 1.3 million connection opportunity. So still very, very strong. There are lots of good work in that area.\nShar Pourreza: Got it. And then just a last one for me is just the shape of that 7% to 9%, I mean, obviously, you guys, you're executing on the regulatory front. You've got a good footprint there, some dilution. But I guess what else should we assume -- or I guess as we're thinking about modeling and the extension, where are you sort of within that range as we're thinking about like the near term versus the longer term as we're just thinking about the profile of that shape.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. I think it's a good question, and I'll just repeat what I've said several times now. And I do think you can tie it back to the HOS sale. Recall our discussion about a year ago that when we sold that business and this transition to sort of full utility, the opportunity created by that sale would result in a ramp-up of the spend. So it takes us a while to get that spend fully deployed and get it fully in rates.  So I'd say in the near term, like you see a little bit in '22 and our guidance for '23, which we think is quite strong, there is obviously a ramp-up still reflected there. And we've got the proceeds that will come in from the note on the HOS sale at the end of '26. So again, you think about that sort of working its way into the plan. I'd just say what we've laid out in '22 and '23 is reflective of that ramp-up. Our view continues to be this long-term growth rate of 7 to 9, we see that extending well into the future. And we just got to get through this sort of ramp-up period, and you'll see that growth rate continue.\nShar Pourreza: Terrific. We'll see you in a couple of weeks. Appreciate it.\nSusan Hardwick : All right. Thanks, Shar.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim: First, just going back to the -- your comments on the financing, especially the equity, I appreciate your commentary on the bulk of it potentially being in '23. I guess, is it possible that when you assess the various equity options that you could potentially look to price that equity in 2022, but look to draw that down in 2023, just given market volatility.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. I think market conditions certainly play into our decisions here around timing and ultimate size and the tool that we use. So that's obviously still in all of our discussions internally. John, anything you want to add to that?\nSusan Hardwick : No, that's right. And I'd say that we're not expecting to issue in 2022 into. But obviously, as Susan said, everything is subject to market conditions.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. And then that 7% to 9% EPS growth rate, should we assume that it's now kind of basing off of the '23 guidance? Or should we still use '21 or '22.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. It's a good question. Obviously, we get this question a lot. And I'm confident my answer will frustrate you. Our view is that it's a long-term growth rate. We would expect that 7% to 9% to be the guidance regardless of the period that you're looking at. Internally, we actually don't really use a base year to do the math off of. Our view is it's a long-term growth rate. I know in the past, we have used sort of prior year actual or your latest actual information to base off of. But again, our view would be it doesn't really matter. The long-term growth rate is really the driver.\nInsoo Kim: Got it. I thought I'd try. Then just 1 more apologies. Maybe for Cheryl, I think the EPA maybe still -- late this year may be on track to put out some mandates related to PFOS and other water contaminant kind of at the maximum levels. Just based on your operations and your jurisdictions, how would that -- given what could come out, how could that impact your CapEx or O&M strategy a bit?\nCheryl Norton: Yes. So great question. We do anticipate that EPA is going to release those regulations later this year. And because we don't know exactly where they're going to fall, it's a little hard to kind of put a specific dollar amount on it, but we have a really good handle on what we have across our system and what the needs will be depending on what those EPA regulations come out at. And we're prepared to invest the capital needed, put treatment in place right away. We have gotten -- we found it to be a very quick process to design and get treatment online wherever we may need to. So we know what we've got out there and we kind of know what to expect depending on what EPA comes out with. So we just have to wait and see. We don't want to spend more capital than we have to, but we also want to make sure that we're meeting the regulations as quickly as possible and protecting our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julien Dumoulin Smith with Bank of America.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Congratulations. Just wanted to follow up. I know there's a lot of questions about the growth rate. Just what's the base here point here. Are we talking about pre-'23 at this point? Or are we rolling forward to '23 to the 7% to 9% outlook, if we could just start there.\nSusan Hardwick : Well, Julien, as I said to into, we don't really look at it that way. Our view is a long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% is the answer. So our view is you can start within a year you want, and you're going to get the same result.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Okay. All right. Sorry. I just -- I wanted to just press a little bit. All right. And then if I -- a little bit then -- I was checking here. If I can speak a little bit about the trajectory though. As you think about the commentary and I heard the early response on equity dilution for '23. What does that say for '24 vis-a-vis within that range? Obviously, '23 being at the lower end of 7% to 9%. As you think about rolling forward that dilution it seems like more so into '24. Do you think that, again, the 7 to 9 \"backhalf weighted\" regardless of whatever time period you want to use?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. I think John's comment about the impact of dilution is really the right one. Our view is that the dilution is pretty minimal from the issue that we're anticipating in '23. I think the real driver is the ramp-up of the CapEx. I mean we're just putting these dollars all to work. We've got the proceeds coming in again from HOS in '26. I think as we continue to see that ramp up work its way through the plan, you'll start to see towards the back end of the plan, more consistent growth rates.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: All right. Excellent. No, fair enough. And then just lastly, just to clarify some of the earlier conversation about the cash tax rate. So what are the planning assumptions reflected in the guidance here as you think about '22, '23, et cetera, just trying to baseline ourselves here, if you can.\nSusan Hardwick : Well, I mean, obviously, we're a full cash taxpayer now. So this 5-year plan reflects that. The comment earlier around what does IRA mean to us in terms of the alternative minimum tax, I mean, again, there's still many rules and definition still to be done around that, that I don't think any of us know exactly how it will work. But I would just reiterate what I said a minute ago, we've modeled a variety of scenarios, all of which fit in this plan that we've laid out here.\nJulien Dumoulin Smith: Well, the time all the best. We'll speak to you soon. All right. .\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland : Just starting on 2023 guidance. The $0.25 to $0.29 cost inflation and interest rates with 75% of that covered in rates. I'm curious on the pension side, does that kind of bake in your estimate of the current marks and is it still fair to think about you say market moves from here in the interest rate backdrop as potential upside or downside versus this outlook. Just curious what you baked in on the assumptions there.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, it's a good question. And as John said in the prepared remarks, obviously, we'll measure at the end of the year and determine what our actual '23 expense is once we get to the end of the year. But how we've handled this from a regulatory perspective is for the most part, what we have gotten accomplished here is whatever the '23 expense ends up being, that's what will get reflected in rates. So we've left it a little bit open-ended in that regulatory arena, where we'll actually set it at the number once we know what the number is. And in other situations, we've estimated what we think the impact will be based on year-to-date performance and expected performance for the balance of the year.\nRichard Sunderland : Okay. Understood. And I guess to tackle the other side on chemicals, fuel power, is that effectively a reasonable assumption in terms of rolling forward to '24 as well if the current environment persists? Or is there sufficient kind of incremental regulatory activity coming down the road here to mitigate even more of that in the $24 million?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. I think what we have accomplished so far in the regulatory arena, obviously, will be in rates until we adjust rates again. And I think we'll have continued opportunity in the regulatory arena to address these cost impacts in other jurisdictions. And again, in some cases, the ability to adjust for what the actual costs are in existing cases, or in existing jurisdictions. It just depends on how we address it in each specific state. I think, again, the overall conclusion here is we've got the vast majority of these costs covered and should not really be a drag on our expectations going forward.\nRichard Sunderland : Got it. That's very clear. Understood. And if I could just sneak in 1 more on '23. Is there any step-up that you expect on the revenue share related to the Homeowner Services transaction? I guess just curious in terms of walking year-over-year on the hot side, it looks like effectively steady contributions less the post-close adjustments in '22. Is that the right way to be thinking about it?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, I think it's -- that's probably the right way to think about it. We're continuing in the jurisdictions of our states that don't have those agreements in place. We're continuing to evaluate those opportunities and working very closely with now the HOS ownership or leadership to see if opportunities exist. So it's a very active part of our business plan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.\nDurgesh Chopra : Just -- congrats by the way, on the regulatory execution here year-to-date. You guys have done a phenomenal job and great outcomes. Just on the acquisition side of things, can you update us on where you stand year-to-date versus your targets? I think this year, you're planning on hitting $500 million in acquisitions. So could you just update us there? And then I have a follow-up.\nSusan Hardwick : Sure. John, you want to handle that?\nJohn Griffith : Durgesh, we're on track. I think we've closed about 65,000 customers to date with another kind of 5,000 or so customers to come. I would say that on a dollars basis, as we disclosed in our slides, our expected closings for the year will be in the neighborhood of $350 million, which -- and as you know, we target about $300 million to $400 million a year. We've said over 5 years, we're $1.5 billion to $2 billion on a run rate basis.\nDurgesh Chopra : Got it. $250 million for this year. Okay. And then maybe I was just -- and I don't want to front on your equity process, but just anything, John, you can share in terms of what are you looking for in terms of valuation or price ranges for this equity? I understand significant portion is expected to land next year. Any additional color that you can share with us there?\nJohn Griffith : No, Durgesh, I wouldn't say we think of in terms of specific price ranges. Obviously, we'll be very cognizant of market conditions. But I'd say we just -- we think of it more in terms of what we've messaged in the past, which is the equity from a mid-plan perspective. And as we approach 2023 here, that is mid plan relative to our historical messaging.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.\nSteve Fleishman: So just on the -- a couple of questions related to the equity and balance sheet. So the -- in the 2023 guidance, are you kind of assuming that it's kind of averaged roughly over the year or beginning of the year or just kind of how are you incorporating that into the '23 guidance?\nSusan Hardwick : John, do you want to take that?\nJohn Griffith : Sure. Yes, I think, Steve, that's a fair way to characterize '23 for modeling purposes. I'd say, I think the words we used, a significant portion of our equity, I think you can think of that as is north of $1 billion of issuance in '23. And as you know, we'll have to kind of find the right windows. But I think midyear is a reasonable way to think about it.\nSusan Hardwick : I would only add that -- let me just add quickly, Steve. I think that -- and John said this, market conditions, of course, will drive this. But we are still looking at how best to do it. You've heard us talk in the past about it's likely going to be in sort of a single issue or a block, but we do need to evaluate all the options available to us. So that's still in the works.\nSteve Fleishman: Okay. Makes sense. And then could you -- maybe just on the balance sheet, could you give more color on the comment about getting -- adding some of this for balance sheet, cushion or flexibility? And what's the thinking there today versus in the past? Is it just the volatility of markets? Is it what you see in terms of kind of acquisition pipeline or regulated investment pipeline? Or is it tax related? Just why now for the additional balance sheet capacity not a year ago or 2 years ago?\nSusan Hardwick : John, do you want to take that?\nJohn Griffith : Sure. Yes, I'd say, Steve, just as we've thought about our metrics over time, we're in a very strong credit position, but we do look at our ramping up of capital spend, both on the organic side as well as on the acquisition side. And so we just think it's healthy for us to have some cushion there. I would say just also, as we're thinking about the cadence of our equity issuance, where we'll do much of it in 2023, but then waiting until the back end of our plan for another issuance as we thought about it. That's just a natural consequence of creating some cushion for ourselves.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. Steve, I'd simply add to that. I think that we talked a lot about payout ratio on the dividend. And obviously, we narrowed the dividend range a little bit here. We just feel the need to continue to really push ourselves on the ability to advance this capital spending. As Cheryl talked about the replacement cycle, we just don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we have to put some constraints on that on the investment side. So I think if we can create a little capacity here, it just helps us have that level of certainty around our ability to continue to accelerate. And these market conditions obviously are quite volatile, and it just doesn't hurt in this environment to have a little bit of extra cushion there. So I think that's really honestly the driver.\nOperator: Next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.\nGregg Orrill: I was wondering if your guidance on the operating cash flows for '23 to '27, that ramp-up versus the prior plan, if there's anything sort of non-operating in there or adjustments or if that's really the growth of the business?\nSusan Hardwick : It really is the growth of the business, Gregg. Again, we just -- we feel very good about how we're -- how the investment is being rolled out, cash flows from operations and the ability to get good, solid, timely regulatory solutions.\nJohn Griffith : And Gregg, I'd just add to that, a significant portion is just the roll forward. So if you think about what's rolling off in 2022 versus what's being added in 2027, there's a pretty -- because of the ramp-up in CapEx through those years, that differential is reasonably significant. And then in the interim years because of our ramp, we're recovering additional depreciation -- deferred tax contribution to cash flows. But a lot of it is the roll forward by itself.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as our conference for today. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 18, I'll start by talking about our updated capital plan. I want to first acknowledge that our teams have done a great job executing on our accelerated capital investment plan in 2022. We're on pace to meet our overall capital plan of $2.5 billion this year, which includes acquisition investments.  Looking ahead to 2023, we plan to again step up our investment level this time to roughly $2.9 billion, which will generally be our new annual threshold for the next several years. As John just mentioned, over the next 5 years, we expect to invest approximately $14 billion to $15 billion, an increase of about $1 billion over our previous plan. This increase is mostly driven by including the increased investment for 2027 in the 5-year window as well as about $250 million of inflationary impacts expected in the near term.  We expect this pace of spend to drive our current pipe replacement cycle plan lower and much better than the industry average. On the longer horizon, you can see that we plan to spend approximately $30 billion to $34 billion in our regulated business over the next 10 years. We see this capital plan to be largely in line with last year's plan, reflecting the higher annual run rate as well as modestly higher costs for pipe and other capital goods.  Turning to Slide 19. This graph illustrates that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions are succeeding and growing the regulated business at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth as long as we continue to prudently invest in our systems and successfully execute the regulatory process.  Moving on to our regulatory recovery strategy on Slide 20, our theme here is around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it levels out build increases to our customers, which helps promote affordability. It's beneficial to our customers that we operate in states that have constructive regulatory mechanisms. We've engaged with policymakers and regulators for well over a decade to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, while putting the customer first. In the states where we operate, 27 new mechanisms have been added over the past 12 years. As water and wastewater industry challenges grow, we'll continue to focus on constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes. I'd also like to discuss timely recovery of our investments across our footprint with the pie chart on the right side of the page. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we are able to reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This enables us not only to earn our return, but also to mitigate the size of the general rate increases for our customers. We expect about 45% of capital investments over the next 5 years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms, which is the key to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term.  Turning to Slide 21. Our focus on operating efficiency has been a part of our company's DNA for many years. As you know, we've historically used O&M efficiency as one of our benchmark metrics to measure our success at managing costs as we grow the business. This focus positioned us well to manage through much of the pressure over the last couple of years on the supply chain and even cost increases brought about by the effects of the pandemic.  As we look ahead, we've been asked if we can go below the 30% efficiency threshold. While we're continuing to evaluate that question, we've continued to emphasize that revenue growth has been just as important to our success with O&M efficiency as managing costs. So with that realization in mind, there may very well be additional opportunity to go below the 30% threshold. However, we're analyzing whether this is the best metric by which to judge our effectiveness at managing costs and running an efficient business. Moving to Slide 22. One of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Thankfully, as we sit here today, our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. In fact, as investors and analysts study the sustainability of American Water's long-term earnings growth potential, we believe our affordability proposition is an important consideration. We realize, though, that we must continue to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We must also consider our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and a sharp focus on cost management in order to deliver on values around customer affordability.  Moving on to Slide 23, and as Susan mentioned earlier, we are excited to announce our new science-based greenhouse gas emission reduction goals and our first disclosure of estimated Scope 3 emissions. Before we dive in, I'll walk you through our greenhouse gas emissions profile in a bit more detail. As an essential service provider, American Water is often compared to the broader utility sector emissions included, which can be misleading. As Susan noted earlier, it's an important distinction that our emissions footprint as a water utility is much smaller than most publicly traded gas and electric companies on both an absolute and per customer basis. To help put it into context, American Water represents just 0.1% of the total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions produced by the top 20 largest U. S. utilities measured by market cap.  As we show on the slide, our total emissions footprint is made up of 7% direct Scope 1 emissions, such as heating, cooling and fleet; 44% indirect Scope 2 emissions or our purchase power; and 49% estimated Scope 3 emissions, which for us largely includes purchased goods and services, capital goods and fuel and energy-related activities. Framing it in a different way, more than 90% of our overall emissions footprint is generated from external sources, which is another key differentiator from most other utilities.  Turning to Slide 24, there's a lot to unpack here. Let me say first, at a high level, we believe it is prudent for our company to focus our efforts on environmental initiatives that are in the purview of a water utility and aligned with our core mission. Our view is that greenhouse gas emission reductions fit as part of our sustainability strategy that, over time, will help protect customers against service disruptions from more severe weather patterns such as droughts and floods. We believe we've set forth new compelling goals to support this strategy. First, we expect to reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 50% by 2035 from a 2020 baseline. Second, we expect to achieve net 0 Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050. We believe these new medium- and long-term emissions goals are rooted in science and aligned with the Paris Agreement. We also believe our approach is a responsible path that considers all of our stakeholders' interest including doing our part by setting ambitious reduction goals. Our approach here will allow us to stay on course with our customer affordability metrics, as we continue to deliver clean, safe, affordable and reliable water to our customers. This was a foundational component of our analysis and recent discussion with our Board level SETO Committee, which oversees our safety, environmental, technology and operations efforts.  It's also important to note that as we deliver water and wastewater solutions to more customers over time through acquisitions and organic growth, our energy usage is going to increase. We will rebaseline each year to account for our growth through acquisitions of systems, which is an acceptable practice under the standards of the science-based targets initiative, or SBTi. We did consider making a commitment to SBTi as part of our analysis this year. However, we concluded that some of SBTi's expectations around Scope 3 commission commitments mostly around timing, we're not in the best interest of our stakeholders. We do expect, though, to continue to work with our suppliers and vendors to consider what can be done to reduce Scope 3 emissions over time. And as I stated, we are confident that our new medium- and long-term Scope 1 and Scope 2 goals are science-based and aligned with the Paris Agreement. As you can see at the bottom of the slide, these are more than just goals. We have plans in place and capital ready to deploy to achieve these goals, obviously, with greater visibility to the path to 2035. Since our footprint is heavily weighted by Scope 2 emissions, the continued greening of the electric grid is a significant component of our reduction plan. We hope to see that transition continue by our fellow utilities and other providers. For us though, we know that it is cost prohibitive and outside of our core competencies to self-generate all or even a significant portion of our power needs. We will, though, continue to look to enter into clean purchase power agreements or partner on renewable investments, where appropriate, similar to our engagement with New Jersey Resources on the floating solar array at one of our treatment plants in New Jersey.  Lastly, we will continue to focus on emissions reduction activities that we can control within our operations. This includes water efficiency and operational efficiency gains in order to reduce the energy and emissions associated with the pumping of water, which we disclosed previously is by far the largest driver of our purchase power needs. Capital projects will include the deployment of additional leak detection technologies and more efficient water pumps across our systems as well as converting some of our fleet vehicles and other assets to more efficient options. These are small, but important pieces of our plan. And in large part, these capital investments will align perfectly with some of our existing reliability and resiliency goals. Next, let's turn to Slide 25 and discuss some new disclosures related to our continued ESG journey. First, soon, we will release summary results of our most recent pay equity study on our ID&E website, diversity@aw.com. This is our third such pay equity study. And each time we have engaged a third-party consultant to conduct an objective pay equity analysis. I'm pleased to share that you will see that we're very close to achieving pay parity across employee groups, including gender.  Our performance is a testament to American Water's commitment to fair and equal pay and how our teams have leveraged findings from these regular assessments to correct any qualities and update processes around compensation. We will also share some initial summary findings of our internal labor market analysis that began in 2021. This analysis was also led by a third-party firm and was commissioned because we believe the factual and statistical analysis of our workforce was needed to support a holistic evidence-based inclusion, diversity and equity strategy. Lastly, I'd like to touch on 2 of our new goals that were established earlier this year in our annual performance plan. The first is to increase representation of female employees at American Water and the second is to increase ethnic and racial diversity among American Water employees. Both of these goals complement existing safety and environmental sustainability goals that are tied to annual performance plan compensation for all employees. As mentioned earlier, these goals reflect our company's focus on social benefits that we believe will help us operate as a stronger company, ultimately for the benefit of our employees and to help us better reflect the customers and communities we serve. Whether it's our ESG leadership or our consistent execution on our earnings growth goals or our leading safety culture, our team at American Water has consistently raised the bar for success in the water and wastewater industry. We have full confidence in our ability to achieve the goal we talked about today for 2023 and beyond. So with that, I'll stop and turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have. Yes. So great question. We do anticipate that EPA is going to release those regulations later this year. And because we don't know exactly where they're going to fall, it's a little hard to kind of put a specific dollar amount on it, but we have a really good handle on what we have across our system and what the needs will be depending on what those EPA regulations come out at. And we're prepared to invest the capital needed, put treatment in place right away. We have gotten -- we found it to be a very quick process to design and get treatment online wherever we may need to. So we know what we've got out there and we kind of know what to expect depending on what EPA comes out with. So we just have to wait and see. We don't want to spend more capital than we have to, but we also want to make sure that we're meeting the regulations as quickly as possible and protecting our customers."

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Aaron said, we have a lot to discuss this morning in addition to third quarter results. And specifically, we also want to cover today our outlook for 2023 and our longer-term targets. As you know, last year, at this time, we shared some significant news when we sold our homeowner services business to transition to a pure-play regulated water and wastewater utility. In that update, we announced a new 5-year plan and acceleration of capital investments and some adjustments to our financial targets. The updates that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of last year's plan and targets with adjustments primarily reflecting the shift out to 2027 in our 5-year outlook. We will also share additional thoughts and plans around our continuing ESG journey. So let's dive in and turn to Slide #5, where I'll start by covering some highlights of 2022 to date. In the first 9 months of 2022, earnings were $3.70 per share compared to $3.40 per share in the same period of 2021. Strong organic growth and increased earnings from infrastructure investments continue to be our year-over-year drivers for the quarter and year-to-date periods. Favorable weather also added to results in the third quarter.  Though we generally, like others, are experiencing a higher cost environment, our team continues to deliver on our financial and operating plans. This includes staying on track to achieve our total capital investment goal of $2.5 billion in 2022 and executing on significant regulatory activities, including constructive settlements in 2 of our outstanding general rate cases. Further, we continue to effectively manage and mitigate cost increases and have been successful in recent regulatory efforts to further lessen the impact of inflationary pressures into the future. These regulatory solutions are very important to our ability to manage inflationary headwinds as we move into 2023. So I'm pleased that we've successfully executed our plan so far this year in a challenging and very active period. John and Cheryl will provide additional details on financial, operating and regulatory results later in today's call. But before I move on, let me comment about how excited we were to sign an agreement a few weeks ago to serve the nearly 15,000 customers of the Butler Area Sewer Authority in Western Pennsylvania. This is another great example of how partnerships with municipalities can lead to positive outcomes for customers, employees and the community at large. Our team worked very hard to understand the community's objectives and created an opportunity that we believe benefits all stakeholders. Turning to Slide 6. As announced yesterday, we affirmed our 2022 earnings guidance. We continue on track to meet our expectations for the year as we've indicated throughout the year. And in addition, we have had the incremental contribution from weather this quarter. Also yesterday, we initiated our 2023 earnings guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. This near-term plan as well as our longer-term plan remains very strong, and with our record of execution we are confident in our ability to achieve our earnings expectations for 2023.  Later, John will talk more about the drivers of our growth in 2023, but our expected growth builds on the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth last year. As we've said many times, the full effect on earnings growth from the increasing capital spending will ramp up over time. John will talk further about our updated financing plan, but this plan reflects our prior discussion that the growing investment plan will result in regular access to equity capital. As we've illustrated on this slide, we expect our investments in infrastructure and regulated acquisitions to drive significant earnings growth through 2017 and beyond. Finally, on Slide 7, I want to make a few comments about our purpose here at American Water and how that drives our growth strategy, our operating plans and our company's targets and goals. Our mission is to provide safe, clean, affordable and reliable water and wastewater services to the communities across the country. Our services are vital to sustaining life. So while much has said in the news about the clean energy transition that's happening, what drives us every day is an equally important need in our country. We believe that everyone should have access to safe, clean, affordable and reliable drinking water and wastewater services, and that communities are stronger because American Water has the privilege to serve them.  It's true that we have many similarities to the utilities, and we embrace the knowledge sharing and best practices that can come with those similarities. In fact, we joined EEI as a strategic partner a few years ago because of common values around customer service, safety and cybersecurity, to name just a few. And as many of you know, I've spent most of my career in the gas and the electric industry. So I have a deep appreciation for the utility industry as a whole. However, the water industry and American Water also have some important differences from other utilities. Our capital projects, for example, are much smaller on average than those in the electric and natural gas industries. Even though they add up to a similar and very significant investment need. Another difference is our greenhouse gas emissions footprint, which is very small compared to most other publicly traded electric and gas utilities.  That said, we are seeing the impacts that climate variability can have through more extreme droughts or more severe floods. We strongly believe we must do our part to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions. We have now set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals, including achieving net 0 by 2050. Along with our goals for system resiliency, and water use and efficiency, we see our greenhouse gas reduction goals as part of our commitment to provide superior and affordable service to our customers. We believe American Water is the leader in a clean water and wastewater transition in the United States. For the communities we already serve and the communities we hope to serve in the future, the capital investment needs that are required to deliver more sustainable water and wastewater services are immense. It's up to us to find ways to balance those CapEx needs with the affordability of services for our customers. That's why we've added a customer affordability target to our list of key drivers you see here.  As a company, we also continue to raise the bar on our efforts to create a fair and equitable place to work in addition to making sure our operations align with the spirit of environmental justice. Two recent examples of our broad focus were the recognition through the 2022 WaterSense Excellence Award from the Environmental Protection Agency and the 2022 Leading Disability Employer by the National Organization on Disability. Cheryl will provide some examples later of the good things we are doing internally in these areas. Finally, on this slide, you can see we are affirming our long-term earnings growth targets, and most of our other long-term financial targets remain unchanged. During our planning process this fall, we decided to narrow our long-term dividend growth target to 7% to 9%, which maintains our position in the top tier of dividend growth and payout ratio in the industry. Our long-term dividend growth target now fully aligns with our compelling EPS growth target of 7% to 9% and the significance of our capital investment plan and related financing. This minor adjustment rounds out our strong long-term plan and will help us achieve our other important financial targets over time. In summary, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth supported by significant and yet low-risk capital investment plan as well as our ESG leadership premium and constructive position on affordability will continue to be rewarded by investors. Based on the long-term plan and our history of executing on our strategies, we expect to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover more detail on our 2022 financial results, our 2023 and longer-term outlook and our financing plans. John? Well, Angie, a lot in your question there, and let me maybe just comment at a high level, and then I'll have John jump in and talk a little bit more around -- our thinking around equity and the plan there. But recall from our, I guess, really the last few years, as we've talked about our equity needs and our expectation around that, we've been signaling sort of mid-plan and we released that guidance probably 2-plus years ago.  So I think this '23 timing now that we're giving a little bit more insight into is consistent with our prior messaging, the increase in the size of the equity that we now have in this plan, I think, as we've highlighted, really has to do with the increased capital over the course of the 5 years. And Cheryl indicated that we're kind of stepping up to roughly a $2.9 billion investment per year over that 5-year period. So there is more capital coming in throughout the entire 5-year focus of the plan. And then we've also added a little bit of additional equity expectation here just to create some additional balance sheet capacity as we think about that going forward.  The other important thing I would comment on around -- your opening comment around hitting expectations for '23. I just want to underscore again what we said in our prepared remarks around our regulatory approach to these inflationary costs. We have been very proactive in trying to get our hands around what we thought those impacts might be and we have worked very closely with regulators to try to build in, in these existing cases we're working on, the coverage for those costs. And I think we've said something well over 75% of those expected costs in the near term, we have built in these cases that we're ramping up now.  So I think I'd say, again, to summary, the equity plan is pretty much on track with what we've said historically and the increase in capital is driving the bulk of that need of additional equity in the plan. And then our proactive approach on regulatory is absolutely part of our ability to be confident about our expectations for '23. So John, anything to add on the equity piece? Yes, I think it's a good question, Angie. But I think Cheryl hit on it and you did even in your remark there, we just don't view it as our core competency. There are folks that are sort of in that business, and we believe we have the opportunity to work closely with them to develop solutions and take advantage of those renewable sources that are out there without owning them. We've got enough to do. And you even acknowledge, it's not really a growth driver. We've got plenty to do on just our investment side to continue the growth. So we don't need it from that standpoint.  Your observation around tax, I think, is also a good one. But I would tell you, we think we have the right strategy here to finance this plan and manage all the elements of the requirements in that plan with what we've laid out here. So while we're always interested in and spend quite a bit of time on tax planning and tax strategy, it just does not -- it just doesn't fit our profile. Yes, Angie, let me just turn it to John and have him sort of weigh in on that question. Yes. And I just would add to that simply that we work very hard in cultivating these opportunities to make sure we're developing the right solution for these communities, and I think that's a big advantage for us. Well, the first part of your statement is correct. Yes. The gain on the HOS transaction sort of advanced us to being a cash taxpayer. Still evaluating what the IRA means and the alternative minimum tax and financial income greater than $1 billion. There's still lots to be sorted out in terms of what that final rules are and the final interpretation of those. So we're monitoring it closely. We've obviously modeled a variety of scenarios around it. And I would just say, in all those scenarios, this plan adequately covers any exposure we think we might have there. John, do you want to take that? Yes. And I don't think we highlighted it really much on this call. But our pipeline remains in excess of 1.3 million connection opportunity. So still very, very strong. There are lots of good work in that area. Yes. I think it's a good question, and I'll just repeat what I've said several times now. And I do think you can tie it back to the HOS sale. Recall our discussion about a year ago that when we sold that business and this transition to sort of full utility, the opportunity created by that sale would result in a ramp-up of the spend. So it takes us a while to get that spend fully deployed and get it fully in rates.  So I'd say in the near term, like you see a little bit in '22 and our guidance for '23, which we think is quite strong, there is obviously a ramp-up still reflected there. And we've got the proceeds that will come in from the note on the HOS sale at the end of '26. So again, you think about that sort of working its way into the plan. I'd just say what we've laid out in '22 and '23 is reflective of that ramp-up. Our view continues to be this long-term growth rate of 7 to 9, we see that extending well into the future. And we just got to get through this sort of ramp-up period, and you'll see that growth rate continue. All right. Thanks, Shar. Yes. I think market conditions certainly play into our decisions here around timing and ultimate size and the tool that we use. So that's obviously still in all of our discussions internally. John, anything you want to add to that? No, that's right. And I'd say that we're not expecting to issue in 2022 into. But obviously, as Susan said, everything is subject to market conditions. Yes. It's a good question. Obviously, we get this question a lot. And I'm confident my answer will frustrate you. Our view is that it's a long-term growth rate. We would expect that 7% to 9% to be the guidance regardless of the period that you're looking at. Internally, we actually don't really use a base year to do the math off of. Our view is it's a long-term growth rate. I know in the past, we have used sort of prior year actual or your latest actual information to base off of. But again, our view would be it doesn't really matter. The long-term growth rate is really the driver. Well, Julien, as I said to into, we don't really look at it that way. Our view is a long-term growth rate of 7% to 9% is the answer. So our view is you can start within a year you want, and you're going to get the same result. Yes. I think John's comment about the impact of dilution is really the right one. Our view is that the dilution is pretty minimal from the issue that we're anticipating in '23. I think the real driver is the ramp-up of the CapEx. I mean we're just putting these dollars all to work. We've got the proceeds coming in again from HOS in '26. I think as we continue to see that ramp up work its way through the plan, you'll start to see towards the back end of the plan, more consistent growth rates. Well, I mean, obviously, we're a full cash taxpayer now. So this 5-year plan reflects that. The comment earlier around what does IRA mean to us in terms of the alternative minimum tax, I mean, again, there's still many rules and definition still to be done around that, that I don't think any of us know exactly how it will work. But I would just reiterate what I said a minute ago, we've modeled a variety of scenarios, all of which fit in this plan that we've laid out here. Yes, it's a good question. And as John said in the prepared remarks, obviously, we'll measure at the end of the year and determine what our actual '23 expense is once we get to the end of the year. But how we've handled this from a regulatory perspective is for the most part, what we have gotten accomplished here is whatever the '23 expense ends up being, that's what will get reflected in rates. So we've left it a little bit open-ended in that regulatory arena, where we'll actually set it at the number once we know what the number is. And in other situations, we've estimated what we think the impact will be based on year-to-date performance and expected performance for the balance of the year. Yes. I think what we have accomplished so far in the regulatory arena, obviously, will be in rates until we adjust rates again. And I think we'll have continued opportunity in the regulatory arena to address these cost impacts in other jurisdictions. And again, in some cases, the ability to adjust for what the actual costs are in existing cases, or in existing jurisdictions. It just depends on how we address it in each specific state. I think, again, the overall conclusion here is we've got the vast majority of these costs covered and should not really be a drag on our expectations going forward. Yes, I think it's -- that's probably the right way to think about it. We're continuing in the jurisdictions of our states that don't have those agreements in place. We're continuing to evaluate those opportunities and working very closely with now the HOS ownership or leadership to see if opportunities exist. So it's a very active part of our business plan. Sure. John, you want to handle that? John, do you want to take that? I would only add that -- let me just add quickly, Steve. I think that -- and John said this, market conditions, of course, will drive this. But we are still looking at how best to do it. You've heard us talk in the past about it's likely going to be in sort of a single issue or a block, but we do need to evaluate all the options available to us. So that's still in the works. John, do you want to take that? Yes. Steve, I'd simply add to that. I think that we talked a lot about payout ratio on the dividend. And obviously, we narrowed the dividend range a little bit here. We just feel the need to continue to really push ourselves on the ability to advance this capital spending. As Cheryl talked about the replacement cycle, we just don't want to find ourselves in a situation where we have to put some constraints on that on the investment side. So I think if we can create a little capacity here, it just helps us have that level of certainty around our ability to continue to accelerate. And these market conditions obviously are quite volatile, and it just doesn't hurt in this environment to have a little bit of extra cushion there. So I think that's really honestly the driver. It really is the growth of the business, Gregg. Again, we just -- we feel very good about how we're -- how the investment is being rolled out, cash flows from operations and the ability to get good, solid, timely regulatory solutions."

            "name": "John Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 9. Let me provide a few more details on third quarter results. Regulated results in total increased $0.16 per share compared to the prior year. We saw a $0.32 per share increase related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. Also, weather was favorable by an estimated $0.07 per share year-over-year due primarily to warmer and drier conditions in 2022.  O&M and other expense increased by $0.10 per share, which reflects an estimated $0.07 of inflation on chemical, power and fuel costs and higher interest rates. Depreciation expense also increased $0.04 per share in support of growth in the regulated business. And as you know, 2021 third quarter results included $0.09 per share of operating earnings from our former New York subsidiary. Finally, the market-based business and other results decreased in the third quarter of 2022 as the $0.09 per share of operating earnings from HOS in the third quarter of 2021 was offset by the $0 06 per share of earnings in 2022 from interest income and revenue share agreements. Moving to Slide 10. Consolidated results increased $0.30 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the third quarter. While I won't go through all of the details of the year-to-date results, in short, we are pleased with our financial performance over the first 9 months of the year.  Our leaders across the business have adjusted to the changing economic environment in 2022. Their ability to do so has put us in a good position to achieve the full year operating results we laid out in our initial 2022 guidance a year ago.  Let's turn to Slide 11 and cover the regulatory activity in our states. Shown here is our summary of completed rate cases in 2022 and key facts for each of the rate case filings so far this year. In the appendix, we also share some details of changes in our infrastructure charges year-to-date. These efforts reflect Susan's comment on our team's ability to execute our regulatory strategies, which is the critical success factor for continuing to grow our business. As we've said before, the common thread in all of these cases is the focus on recovery of infrastructure investments made since the last round of rate cases totaling over $4 billion, and in some states, the roll-in of acquisitions. As we continue to ramp up capital investments in 2023, it will take time to see recovery of those investments in rates. We continue to expect to file general rate cases generally every 2 years in our bigger states.  As we have already communicated in August 2022, the New Jersey BPU approved the settlement of our rate request authorizing a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $61 million. The new rates became effective on September 1, 2022. Two key outcomes in this case were the incorporation of our request to update estimates of production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs, and the approval of deferral accounting for pension expense beginning January 1, 2023. The success of our proactive regulatory approach to these pressures will lessen the risk to shareholders into the future. Turning back to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in 5 jurisdictions. In 2 of these states, Pennsylvania and Virginia, we have reached settlement agreements with the parties and have on-file petitions for approval of the settlements. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in late April, seeking recovery of $1.1 billion of investments since the prior case. The settlement provides for a total annualized revenue increase of $150 million and incorporates updated estimates of pension and OPEB expense.  Similar to New Jersey, this settlement also includes increases in production costs, including chemicals, fuel and power costs. In the coming weeks, an administrative law judge will review the settlement filing and render a recommendation to the Pennsylvania Commission regarding approval of the settlement. After its review, the commission will issue a final order. We expect the order by January 2023, with new rates to be effective as of January 28, 2023. Moving on to Virginia. In late September, a settlement agreement supported by all parties, except one, was filed with the Virginia State Corporation Commission and provides for a $12 million annual revenue increase compared to our original request of $15 million. A final decision in this case is expected in the first quarter of 2023.  In Illinois, where it's been about 6 years since our last general rate case, progress has been steady since our February filing, and last Friday, a proposed order was issued by the case's administrative law judges. We view the key terms of the proposed order as very constructive, including recommended approval of our updated revenue request to capture higher production costs and expected higher pension costs. We expect a final order in the case by January at the latest.  Our cases in California and Missouri were filed in July and are progressing as expected so far. In January of 2023, we will file an update in Missouri for costs and other elements of the case as needed with hearings then to be held in February. We expect the case to reach conclusion by the end of the second quarter 2023. On the legislative front, there was 1 additional notable piece of legislation signed since our second quarter call, California Senate Bill 1469, which allows the commission to consider and authorize the implementation of a decoupling like mechanism. The legislation was signed by the governor on September 30, 2022, and will become effective on January 1, 2023. Our California subsidiary is grandfathered into the previous water revenue adjustment mechanism through the end of our current rate case for 2024 and the team is working to renew decoupling under the new mechanism and the general rate case that was filed July 1 for our next rate period beginning in 2024.  Turning to Slide 12 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle, as Susan mentioned, we were excited to announce in October, our agreement to purchase the Butler Area Sewer Authorities Wastewater System for $232 million. This agreement was executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation, which is a framework that exists across 11 of the states in which we operate. Through September, we have closed on $308 million of acquisitions in 2022, which represents about 65,000 customer connections, and we are excited to have nearly $350 million of signed purchase agreements through October, which sets us up for 2022 and 2023 to be strong years for growth through acquisitions. With the pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections, we expect to continue this track record of success.  On Slide 13, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2023 results in our EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by capital investment to serve our customers and earning a return on that investment. As we've talked about previously, 2022 is year 1 of our accelerated CapEx plan, so it will take some time to ultimately see the ramp-up reflected in earnings. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year. I'd like to add that our Military Services Group does add incrementally to our earnings growth expectation as we have continued to show on our growth triangle. 2023 results will benefit from MSG's successful addition of its first Navy contract that we announced earlier this summer.  Just as critical to our strategy is our ability to recover in rates, the operating costs it takes to run the business, which goes to my final point on the slide. The regulatory solutions we are pursuing such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms are closely aligned with the interest of regulators and customers in managing affordability and limiting variability of customer bills, which ultimately aligns with our investors' interests as well. As we conclude this current round of rate cases, we expect to have in place regulatory solutions for over 75% of the inflationary costs we anticipate in the near term, including pension, interest and production costs. And as always, our team remains vigilant and disciplined on cost management. Finally, related to pension, I'd simply remind you that our pension obligation remeasurement will be done at year-end 2022 and that will drive the determination of our 2023 pension expense.  Wrapping up the 2023 outlook on Slide 14. Here, we are providing some more specifics regarding the key drivers for 2023 that I just discussed. This slide demonstrates the importance of our regulatory execution and the results it drives. It also reflects the financing plans we expect to execute in 2023 that support our capital investment plan, which is an additional $1 billion over the next 5 years as compared to last year's plan. You will notice that we have included a bar for incremental debt and equity financing, which reflects the cost of incremental debt issuance in 2023 to support our growth as well as equity to be issued in 2023, which I will address on the next slide. Our cost of increased interest rates on 2022 debt balances is captured in the cost inflation and interest rates bar, the majority of which is being recovered through the current round of rate cases as just described. We are confident in our ability to deliver on this plan for 2023.  Turning to Slide 15. I'll provide a financing plan update before closing with a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile. Our financing plan now includes an estimated $2 billion of equity issuances from 2023 through 2027, which is an update to the $1.1 billion of equity financing need through 2026 we have previously discussed.  Consistent with our prior messaging on mid-plan timing, subject to market conditions, we are likely to raise a significant portion of the total planned equity in 2023. The increase in the anticipated total equity need is driven largely by the $1 billion of increased CapEx that extends through 2027 in this new plan, along with adding some incremental balance sheet capacity. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of planned equity not completed in 2023 is expected to be issued near the end of the 5-year plan. As we've said for several quarters now, we expect equity will be a regular financing tool going forward to help fund our growth and maintain a strong balance sheet.  Let me conclude by turning to Slide 16 with a reminder that we have a strong balance sheet and credit profile. I'm confident our new 5-year plan is supportive of our current credit ratings as well as our long-term financial target of less than 60% debt to total capital. Another thing I'll point out is our debt maturity profile at the bottom left of the slide.  We believe these levels, along with our planned debt issuances are very manageable. In a rising interest rate environment, it's important that the company has taken a laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years in order to minimize interest rate risk. And as the utility that predominantly invests in long-term assets, I expect us to continue to exclusively issue fixed rate long-term debt to protect against the risk of interest rate volatility.  On liquidity, we continue to remain confident that we have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. In fact, we just announced that we increased our commercial paper program and our revolving credit facility by $500 million each to $2.6 billion and $2.75 billion, respectively, and we extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to October 2027. We believe these actions were appropriate to support our growing business and increased capital investment plan. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our CapEx and rate base growth plan, affordability and some new sustainability goals in more detail. Cheryl? I would just add that as we think about how we're delineating the equity, as we said in our prepared remarks, we'll issue or we expect to issue a significant portion of the equity in 2023. As we think about the consequences of that, based on how we trade, I would characterize that the dilution associated with that is relatively modest. And then as also we pointed out in our remarks, whatever we don't issue in 2023, we would expect to issue in the back end of our plan. Yes, Angie, I would say, I'm glad you asked the question because our answer is No. We haven't really seen a fundamental change in the landscape for making acquisitions. So there's certainly been some noise out there around particular deals. But really nothing has changed. There's a huge number of systems out there, many of which are underinvested and are ripe for potential acquisition. And when we think about the footprint that we have and the focus that we have, we continue to very much like our relative position there and regulated acquisitions will continue to be a key focus area for us. Sure, Shar. I'd say the smaller proportionality is really just a function of the increase in the regulated -- our organic CapEx, I'd say the -- which has more visibility attached to it, as you know, than regulated acquisitions. So in no way are we kind of decreasing our thoughts around putting dollars to work on regulated acquisitions and we continue to feel very good about that. Durgesh, we're on track. I think we've closed about 65,000 customers to date with another kind of 5,000 or so customers to come. I would say that on a dollars basis, as we disclosed in our slides, our expected closings for the year will be in the neighborhood of $350 million, which -- and as you know, we target about $300 million to $400 million a year. We've said over 5 years, we're $1.5 billion to $2 billion on a run rate basis. No, Durgesh, I wouldn't say we think of in terms of specific price ranges. Obviously, we'll be very cognizant of market conditions. But I'd say we just -- we think of it more in terms of what we've messaged in the past, which is the equity from a mid-plan perspective. And as we approach 2023 here, that is mid plan relative to our historical messaging. Sure. Yes, I think, Steve, that's a fair way to characterize '23 for modeling purposes. I'd say, I think the words we used, a significant portion of our equity, I think you can think of that as is north of $1 billion of issuance in '23. And as you know, we'll have to kind of find the right windows. But I think midyear is a reasonable way to think about it. Sure. Yes, I'd say, Steve, just as we've thought about our metrics over time, we're in a very strong credit position, but we do look at our ramping up of capital spend, both on the organic side as well as on the acquisition side. And so we just think it's healthy for us to have some cushion there. I would say just also, as we're thinking about the cadence of our equity issuance, where we'll do much of it in 2023, but then waiting until the back end of our plan for another issuance as we thought about it. That's just a natural consequence of creating some cushion for ourselves. And Gregg, I'd just add to that, a significant portion is just the roll forward. So if you think about what's rolling off in 2022 versus what's being added in 2027, there's a pretty -- because of the ramp-up in CapEx through those years, that differential is reasonably significant. And then in the interim years because of our ramp, we're recovering additional depreciation -- deferred tax contribution to cash flows. But a lot of it is the roll forward by itself."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Jordan. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and in our June 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. The reconciliation for the calculation of the O&M efficiency ratio, a non-GAAP financial measure can be found in our earnings release and in the appendix of the accompanying slide deck, which has been posted to the Investor Relations page on our website. All statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will discuss second quarter and year-to-date highlights and our focus on managing costs in today's inflationary environment. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our financial results in more detail, review our affirmed 2022 earnings guidance and long-term targets, and we'll close with an update on recent acquisition activity. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then review the progress of our investments year-to-date in the Regulated Businesses. We'll share some key details and milestones for several of our active general rate cases, and we'll conclude with another of our ESG impact stories. We'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick : Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let me also say how happy we are to have John Griffith with us as our CFO, and you'll hear more from John shortly. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. In the first six months of 2022, earnings were $2.07 per share compared to $1.87 per share in the same period of 2021. Results for the Regulated Business drove the majority of the growth, accounting for $0.16 of the $0.20 increase while MSG and other results were up $0.04 as compared to the same period in 2021. The regulated growth was in line with our expectations as we knew the first half of the year would be strong due to revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings completed in 2021 and early 2022 and from infrastructure mechanism filings. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs, which I'll talk more about shortly. Our Regulated Business invested over $800 million in capital projects and acquisitions for the quarter and $1.25 billion year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for executing these investments. As you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2022 included the $235 million acquisition of the City of York's wastewater system that we were excited to close in May. Coupled with our strong first quarter results, our capital investments are off to a good start for the year and on pace to meet our $2.5 billion goal for the year. We continue to stay focused on the plan. And as you saw yesterday, we have now for the third time affirmed our 2022 earnings guidance. And John will cover 2022 results and guidance in more detail a little later in the call. Before I move on, let me comment again about how excited we are to welcome the customers and employees of York's wastewater system to the American Water family. As we've said, this is the largest acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water history, and it's a great example of how municipal acquisitions are executed. The importance of understanding the community's objectives can't be underestimated, and we jointly created an opportunity that benefits all stakeholders. And as we think about the competitive landscape for water and wastewater acquisitions, we continue to focus on growing in states where we can leverage our competitive advantage. As we've said many times before, we target acquisitions in the range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers, where we have constructive regulatory environments, an existing footprint and critical mass. This critical mass is important in our efforts to promote customer affordability and cost efficiencies. Also, as we grow in each state, we will have a greater voice to help solve industry challenges through legislative and regulatory policies. So while we won't be awarded every opportunity we pursue, we know that there are plenty of communities in need, and we believe our 135-plus year history of delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services will enable us to continue to achieve a high success rate in our pursuits. The final highlight I'll cover here is that the Military Services Group had another great win at the end of the second quarter. And I'll let Cheryl give you the details, but the award of our first Navy contract at Mayport adds to the 17 other military installations that we're very proud to serve. Turning to Slide 6. I'll take a few minutes here to provide a review of the macroeconomic environment and how we are managing the impacts to the company. Our focus on operating efficiency is not new, as you know. In the chart at the bottom of Slide 6, you can see the result of our disciplined focus on managing costs as we grow the business. This focus has positioned us well to have managed through much of the pressure so far on supply and even cost increases brought about with the effects of the pandemic. Now as we are in what may be an extended period of inflationary pressure, we continue to exercise our disciplined approach to cost management by leveraging our scale. And through midyear, while we are experiencing cost increases in certain supplies and energy, the impacts to date have been fairly modest. In terms of our most significant costs, labor is our biggest operating expense by far. We work regularly with our union leadership to secure contract renewals. And so far, we have been able to achieve very fair outcomes. For our non-union workforce, we're focused on filling key roles and maintaining our practice of competitive compensation. Chemical costs and purchase power are usually the next biggest operating cost. While our supply chain strategies and purchasing power have helped mitigate chemical cost increases, especially as compared to our peers, we do expect higher O&M costs this year due to higher chemical prices. For many years now, the supply chain team has been successful in partnering with operations to secure reliable, cost-effective power and fleet fuel contracts across our footprint. And because of these efforts, we expect only modest power and fuel cost increases in 2022. Overall, we estimate an impact of about $0.06 to $0.08 per share of these types of cost increases year-to-date, which we've been able to generally offset through other results. Later, John will talk more about the possible impacts on the year. But as I said, we are confident in our ability to hit our earnings expectations for the year. And perhaps one final comment before I talk about how we're pursuing regulatory solutions for this rising production cost environment. Certainly, a lot has been written over the last few weeks about pension accounting and expense levels going forward. I'd simply mention that our pension plans were funded at just under 90% as of year-end 2021 with a roughly 50-50 target allocation for equity and fixed income. Though there has been much volatility in the equity markets through midyear, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2022, and that will drive the determination of our 2023 expense. The accounting method we use includes using the fair market value of planned assets at year-end to establish the expected return on plan assets. And we also used the quarter approach for amortizing gains and losses. These methods were selected many years ago and have resulted in moderate variability in pension expense, both favorable and unfavorable over the years, which we've always managed as part of our overall cost management approach. This includes regulatory solutions such as the pension trackers we have in place in Missouri and California, and updates to pension expense in active general rate cases. As an example of how we are addressing these costs in current cases in the Illinois case currently on file, we requested and received approval last week to update the requested revenue requirement for increased costs including an estimated increase in pension costs. That request will be considered in this case. And that goes to my final point on this slide around regulatory solutions. Our teams throughout the company know that regulatory execution is vital to meeting our earnings objectives and our financial plan generally. The regulatory solutions we are pursuing such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms in all of the current active cases are closely aligned with the interest of regulators and customers in managing affordability and limiting variability of customer bills. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no doubt a challenging environment we all find ourselves in, but we remain confident in our ability to manage through it using our disciplined approach to cost management and our ability to execute effectively in the regulatory environment. And with that, let me turn it over to John to cover more detail on our operating results and financing plans. John?\nJohn Griffith : Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. I recall Susan saying on the first quarter earnings call that it had been a privilege to serve as CFO where she was thrilled it was her last one in the role. So before I get started with the results, let me just say that I am thrilled to take the baton from Susan as CFO at American Water and join this great team. So with that, turning to Slide 8, let me provide a few more details on second quarter results. Regulated results in total increased $0.02 per share compared to the prior year. We saw a $0.16 per share increase related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. As a reminder, prior year results reflect an estimated $0.03 per share of favourable weather in the second quarter. O&M expense increased by $0.06 per share, which reflects some of the effects of inflation on chemical, power and fuel costs. Depreciation expense increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the Regulated Business. The Market-Based Business and Other results increased $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2021. These results in 2022 include interest income on the seller note and earnings from revenue share agreements from the 2021 sale of Homeowner Services of $0.06 per share while 2021 results included $0.08 per share of operating earnings from HOS. Results for the Other segment also include interest expense on long-term debt financing in both periods, which has increased year-over-year. Related to HOS, I also wanted to note that we recorded the final working capital true-up entries for HOS in the first half of the year amounting to $0.08 of earnings. As we previously disclosed, we recorded a $0.02 loss on the sale of New York American Water in the first quarter. As is often the case with an organization of our size, it is common to have in any given year a number of pluses and minuses that generally offset. The net earnings contribution of $0.06 per share from these final two sale-related entries has helped to mitigate the impact of the inflationary pressures we have seen so far. Moving to Slide 9. Consolidated results increased $0.20 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. Results from the Regulated Business increased $0.16 per share for the year-to-date period. We saw a 34% -- $0.34 per share increase on higher revenues, somewhat offset by increases in O&M and other operating expenses of $0.08 per share and depreciation of $0.06 per share. The Market-Based Businesses and Other results increased $0.04 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, with generally the same drivers as mentioned for the second quarter results. Overall, we're pleased with our financial performance over the first half of the year. The first half performance sets us up well to deliver on our full year financial plan. Speaking of our 2022 plan, let's now turn to Slide 10. After a solid start to the year, as Susan mentioned, we are affirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. We expect strong revenue growth to continue in the second half of the year as we continue to earn returns on our infrastructure investments from prior years and see additional growth from acquisitions. Second half results when compared to the prior year will be tempered by the sale of our New York American Water operations earlier this year, which historically had its biggest earnings contribution in the third quarter of each year. And as we mentioned, while we are working diligently to limit the impacts to the business of rising costs, we expect to see continued pressures in the second half of the year, primarily related to chemicals and interest expense. As we've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of sale proceeds for HOS in New York,; but the expected earnings from interest on the seller note and revenue from the utility revenue share agreements will nearly offset the loss of the prior annual earnings contribution from HOS. As our team has previously shared, we'll continue to ramp up our capital investments over the next few years as a part of the accelerated investment plan rolled out last November. The earnings from that ramp-up of investment will follow. Finally, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we have in place, including 7% to 9% EPS growth and 8% to 9% rate base growth. We acknowledge the current macroeconomic headwinds and are factoring those in as we progress through our annual budgeting and planning process this summer. As expected, we will provide an updated outlook later this year for 2023 and the longer term. Turning to Slide 11 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle. We were pleased to announce in May our closing of the purchase of our -- of the purchase of the City of York's wastewater system for $235 million where we are now serving approximately 45,000 customer connections. This agreement was executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation, which is a framework that exists now across 12 of the states in which we operate. Turning to a review of the nearly 30,000 customer connections under agreement as of June 30, Egg Harbor City is expected to close in the second half of 2022. Egg Harbor City is the first transaction under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act. Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future as it allows communities with significant operating challenges to avoid a public referendum and swiftly partner with a provider like us to address their issues. And just yesterday, West Virginia American Water announced a signed agreement with Jefferson Utilities to purchase the various water and wastewater system assets of Jefferson Utilities for $30 million. The combined systems serve almost 4,000 customer connections in West Virginia and we expect to close this transaction by the end of this year. The acquisition pipeline is still quite strong at approximately 1.3 million customer connections. The pipeline represents a multitude of potential acquisitions across many states in our footprint, including several additional opportunities that have emerged since our last call as well as the removal of two large deals, York now closed, and another opportunity in Pennsylvania. Let's move to Slide 12 and a reminder that we have a strong balance sheet and credit profile. I believe that our plan, both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it, is supportive of our current credit ratings. This includes the $1.1 billion of equity financing we have previously discussed as we focus on achieving our long-term debt-to-capital target of 60%. We will continue to work hard at maintaining our industry-leading credit ratings for the benefit, ultimately, of our customers. Importantly, these strong issuer ratings are also applied to our senior unsecured debt offerings enabling us to achieve strong financing outcomes like our recent debt offering in May, that's summarized in the appendix of today's slides. The other thing I'll point out on this slide is our debt maturity profile on the bottom left of the slide. In a rising interest rate environment, it is important that the company has taken a laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years in order to minimize interest rate risk. I certainly agree with that strategy and expect to continue that wise approach. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our capital investments and Military Services Group results in more detail. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While I usually start by reviewing the regulated segment's operating results, I want to start today on Slide 14 by covering the announcement coming from our Military Services Group just a few weeks ago. I'm so proud of MSG's latest award our first ever Navy contract. This contract continues the team's streak of utility privatization wins at military installations in recent years. With the addition of the wastewater contract with Naval Station Mayport, we are currently serving 18 installations with between 30 and 50 years remaining on these contracts. We also have two other bids outstanding, one of which is expected to be awarded in 2023. And as you can see, we have a potential of about 70 additional opportunities in the years ahead. MSG's business model centers around adding new military installations to our portfolio and then optimizing revenues through new infrastructure construction projects on the bases we serve. A military installation's mission can change or expand or new technologies or system improvements may be identified that improve efficiency or sustainability. We work with our military partners to identify and lead these needed infrastructure projects. Again, we're extremely proud to provide vital services for the military personnel, their families and the civilians that support these missions. As we turn to Slide 15, let's cover our regulatory activity in our states. Shown here is our summary of completed rate cases in 2022 and key facts for each of the rate case filings so far this year. In the appendix, we also share some details of changes in our infrastructure charges year-to-date. These key efforts reflect Susan's comment on our team's ability to execute our regulatory strategies. As you can see on the slide, our New Jersey case is the furthest along with constructive discussions happening over the last few months. We're really pleased to report that on July 25, the parties to the New Jersey base rate case filed a stipulation of settlement with the Office of Administrative Law resolving all pending issues in the proceeding. The parties are waiting for an initial decision from the administrative law judge. And once it's issued, the matter will be returned to the Board of Public Utilities for a final determination. In Illinois, it's been about six years since our last general rate case, and progress has been steady since our February filing. Evidentiary hearings will start next month, and we expect an order in the case by January. Importantly, Illinois utilizes a forward test year for ratemaking purposes, which is helpful during this period of rising costs faced by the business. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in late April and are seeking recovery of over $1 billion of investments. The case is proceeding as planned, including evidentiary hearings that will occur in September and with an order in this case also expected early next year. Pennsylvania also uses a forward test year for ratemaking purposes. Our cases in California and Missouri were just filed earlier this month and are progressing as expected so far. And finally, as you know, we have another case active in Virginia from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion in 2023. The common thread in all these cases is the focus on recovery of extensive infrastructure investments totaling over $4 billion and in some cases, the roll-in of acquisitions. As we continue to ramp up capital investments over the next few years, it will take time to see recovery of these investments in rates. We expect to continue to file general rate cases every two to three years in our larger states with the ability to go in sooner if we see lingering inflationary impacts or excessive lag from investment, limiting our ability to earn our allowed return. Clearly, regulatory execution is critical to the success of our plans, and we are very confident in our teams that lead our regulatory efforts. As always, we remain very focused on customer affordability. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies coupled with our customer growth efforts have continued to design and customer assistance programs to help our customer affordability. On the legislative front, there were three additional pieces of legislation passed since our first quarter call, one in Illinois, one in Tennessee and one in Missouri. The Illinois bill is an important one to help address the affordability of our bills with certain customers. The Tennessee bill requires all utilities in the state to implement a cybersecurity plan, and we are well positioned to comply. And lastly, the Missouri bill requires a utility to defer any difference in what was actually paid in state or local property taxes compared to what was used to set the revenue requirement. We believe our legislative efforts benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges. On Slide 16, we summarize rate filings completed so far in 2022 as well as total annualized revenue increases being requested in currently active cases. The total of $598 million in pending cases, which includes 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings, reflects the requested amounts in the various cases. Generally speaking, we would expect the final revenue increase granted in each case to go into effect in 2023 or 2024 in the case of California. Turning to Slide 7. Our Regulated Business leaders and their teams did a great job again in the second quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It took a significant effort to safely and efficiently complete the several hundred projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $300 million in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2 billion of regulated capital investment spending in 2022, the foundation of our earnings growth triangle. Moving to Slide 18. I want to just highlight that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions are succeeding in growing our regulated rate base. This, of course, drives earnings growth while we remain focused on operating our systems safely and efficiently to the benefit of our customers. Like we have been doing the last several quarters, I'll close on Slide 19 with another story of ESG impact at American Water. This one comes from a collaborative project between New Jersey American Water and NJR Clean Energy Ventures. The partnership is constructing the largest floating solar array in the U.S. on a lake next to our Canoe Brook Water Treatment Plant. Upon completion later this year, this 8.9 megawatt installation will provide 95% of the plant's annual power needs and will help reduce our annual greenhouse gas emissions. This is another example of a project that creates a financial, operational and ESG win for us and our customers. So with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland : Maybe starting inflation and your guidance reaffirmation, could you frame a little bit of the 2H inflation risk relative to the 6% to 8% impact year-to-date? I guess, in particular, is there any reason the headwind could be ratable? And then given you had the HOS benefit in 1H that offset, how do you think about offsets over the balance of the year?\nSusan Hardwick : Rich, yes, let me make a couple of comments and certainly have John weigh in here. I think we made it hopefully pretty clear in our prepared remarks, first of all, that we affirmed guidance for the year. So as we think about expectations for 2022, we're quite confident in our ability to hit the targets we've established for '22. We did indicate that we continue to see some pressure in headwinds around particularly chemical costs and energy costs. We also highlighted that we're working diligently in the regulatory environment to ensure on a go-forward basis that we have those costs addressed. And as Cheryl pointed out, a number of our cases do have forward-looking test years. So we're hopeful that we can limit any exposure here really to 2022. The other comment that we made, and you obviously rightly pointed out the HOS gain that was recorded, which again, those sorts of transactions are not terribly uncommon when you have a transaction of the size we had last year when we sold HOS, just final working capital true-ups. And I would say they're final. We don't expect any more activity related to that transaction. That was a benefit to the first half of the year that certainly helped us offset some of those cost increases. But I'd also say it's not uncommon for an organization of our size, as John remarked to have pluses and minuses throughout the course of the year. And our focus on cost management, our focus on how we operate, how we are focused on efficiency, we'll continue to have levers that we can pull to offset exposure that we may see in the second half of the year. So that's our plan. And again, I'll just say it again, we affirmed our guidance for 2022, and we fully expect to hit those targets for the year.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. I appreciate the color there. I guess just turning to this topic, but on a macro level with the commentary around CapEx. I'm curious what you're seeing on that front, is there potential for either the dollar spend to go up given inflationary factors? Or I guess, on the other hand, less pipe replacement to occur under the current budgeted CapEx. Just curious how you're thinking about that into the budget update.\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. And Cheryl can weigh in here too from an operating standpoint, but we don't see any change at all in our plans in terms of the amount of work we're doing. We may see some cost increases there on pipe. But I would tell you, again, our supply chain folks have done a tremendous job, both managing the availability of supply and the cost increases we've experienced. They really have been fairly modest on those types of commodities. And again, we don't expect any change in our plans to invest. Cheryl, anything to add there?\nCheryl Norton: Yes, I would just say that we've always got hundreds of projects pretty much ready to go that we know need to be done across our systems. And so we have some flexibility in how quickly we move those projects forward. But at this point, we've been able to manage through any supply chain delays and any cost increases and still get the work that's been prioritized done and continue to do that, we think, through the years coming. So no real concerns there, just being flexible in how we approach those projects.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. That makes sense. And just a final query, you talked about pension impacts. Are you able to quantify the potential headwind in '23?\nSusan Hardwick : No, not at this time. Obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks, we do need to get to the end of the year, we'll do the remeasurement there, and we'll see where we are. But again, our focus would be to use all of the tools at our disposal to manage those types of increases I mentioned in my remarks around regulatory approaches. We've got trackers in two states already, so that will mitigate it there in two of our largest states, by the way. And we're continuing to focus on regulatory solutions in all the cases we have currently on file to address that specific cost. So we're optimistic we'll be able to manage through whatever increases we may or may not see there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Insoo Kim with Goldman Sachs.\nInsoo Kim : My first question going back to, I guess, thinking about the '22 guidance a little bit, given the year-to-date results. I think on Slide 10, you said that second half of '22 EPS will be lower compared to 2H 2021. If I just -- if I take the last four quarters worth of EPS, it gets to kind of, I guess, the midpoint of where '22 guidance would be. So then if the 2H 2022 is going to be lower, is that implying that at least in the range you're trending towards the bottom half of the range?\nSusan Hardwick : I don't think you should assume that. What we tried to point out on Slide 10 is simply the reality of our earnings profile. We're pointing out that in the prior year, you would have had results from New York. We just didn't want folks to miss that as you think about what your expectations are for each of the remaining two quarters. And then we obviously have talked about inflation here and our -- the headwinds we may experience. And again, our strategy is to try to offset those impacts. What we've continued to say is we've affirmed our guidance for 2022, and we're very confident in our ability to hit that.\nInsoo Kim: Okay. Got it. So I should take that in addition to the other commentary on demand, rates and the inflation, too, I guess, I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll secure it more in isolation.\nSusan Hardwick : Exactly.\nInsoo Kim: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. The second question, last month, the EPA put out new advisories for PFAS and other chemicals. I know it's -- a lot of this is more state-based. Some of the states have mandates, some had their own recommendations and it is okay, you guys have had your targets as well. Just based on the new advisories, any thoughts on your operations on the PFAS and other chemical levels, whether that translates into CapEx opportunities or other expenses?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes, it's a good question. And so obviously, it's something that we're very focused on, and I'm going to let Cheryl comment on how we see this latest news.\nCheryl Norton: Yes. Thanks, Susan. What EPA put out recently were health advisories. And there's no regulatory requirement for us to test or to meet any certain levels with those health advisories. Those advisories were extremely low, in our opinion, below the detection limit of the methods to test for PFAS compounds. And so we're anxiously waiting to see what EPA comes back out with as far as a real regulatory limit. But we have tested all across our footprint. We know where we stand and we have already started looking at what capital projects would be necessary going forward. And any regulations in states other than where we're at today will mean future capital investments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.\nAngie Storozynski: Just one comment on 2022. So I remember in the past you used to say that weather can have about a $0.07 positive or negative swing for the year. So I'm just wondering if it's still the case. And I see that you're calling for water conservation in at least parts of New Jersey. And I'm just wondering if that could potentially cap this earnings benefit.\nSusan Hardwick : Angie, I'll let Cheryl comment in a minute about what's specifically happening in New Jersey. We haven't really seen to date through June much of a weather impact. We're all, I think, across the country sort of sweating this quarter. So we'll see what it does to results here in this third quarter. Yes, we've probably moved away from that sort of quantification, I think what we've historically done there. So we'll just need to wait and see what impact it does have on demand in this quarter. And Cheryl, do you want to talk specifically about what's going on in New Jersey?\nCheryl Norton: Yes. We've got two areas in New Jersey where we've seen peak usage rise to the level that we feel it's important that we start to encourage or specifically ask our customers to conserve, to water only on alternating days, put steps like that in place so that we can kind of shave off those peaks and that we can serve our customers continuously without any kind of dips and pressure or anything like that. So we have seen usage spiking, and that's why you're seeing those conservation messages come through.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Changing topics. And I know it's really new, but we see this proposed minimum effective tax rate, right, 15%, at least overnight, that it seems that it might pass. Could you tell us how you think it's going to impact your -- well, your earnings projections, if anything else or cash flows?\nSusan Hardwick : Yes. It's a good -- yes, sure. It's a good question. And obviously, we need to kind of dust off our analysis that has been done around this topic again. And as you said, it's sort of back new in the news. And I think as we've talked about this in the past, it really is probably an impact on cash flow primarily. Ultimately, any impacts to effective tax rates gets worked through the customer bills. So I would say it's probably cash flow -- and I think -- well, again, just need to look at our analysis that we did at the time. I don't recall it being terribly material, but we'll just need to dust it off and see if there's anything there to report.\nAngie Storozynski: Awesome. And just my last question on municipal M&A. I appreciate all the comments, Susan, you had in your prepared remarks. But is there any more you can share about this one -- I wouldn't say an award because it's an exclusivity period took for negotiations, went to your competitor. I mean, we have little to no insight into what terms you proposed versus Aqua Pennsylvania. But I mean, is it as simple as the highest price wins? Or do you have some other competitive advantages? Is it about the location of the service territory? What is it that you might not be winning these contracts despite such a big balance sheet? No contracts...\nSusan Hardwick : Well, yes, sure. I'm obviously not going to comment on any details here. I would simply say it's never that simple. I think it's important to go back to the comments that John made in his prepared remarks that we've got a pipeline at 1.3. We just closed New York. We talked about the acquisition in West Virginia we just announced yesterday. We have plenty to do in this space. There is plenty to do, and we are doing a lot. So we take every opportunity seriously, and we approach every one with the same rigor, the same metrics, the same approach to benefits that can be provided to communities, and we put our best foot forward and then we move on. And that's probably all I have to say about that. Again, we've got lots of great opportunities here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Gaugler with Janney Montgomery Scott.\nMichael Gaugler: On Slide 15, Cheryl, you mentioned in Illinois, the low-income assistance plans now in place. Just wondering, do you have them in most or all of the states you operate in?\nCheryl Norton: Yes, Michael. We have low-income assistance programs all across our footprint, but we're also looking at how we can expand those or how we can make those more accessible to additional customers. We realize there are just some customers out there that no matter how affordable our bills are, they're going to struggle to be able to do that. So we're also working at the federal level, trying to get as much support for a federal assistance program, the program has been hugely popular and helpful for our customers across our footprint in the states where they've implemented that. So we're going to continue to try to work at the federal level to get more federal funding as well as some of those local or more utility-based programs.\nMichael Gaugler: So Illinois then was the -- just to be clear, Illinois was the last one in terms of adopting this type of legislation in your system?\nCheryl Norton: Well, Michael, this is a separate piece of legislation. It -- I wouldn't say that there's legislation in every state. We have our own program, our Help to Others program that all of our states participate in all across our footprint. So our customers have had some access to low-income assistance for years now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Greenwald with Bank of America.\nRyan Greenwald: John, congratulations on the new role. It's a pleasure to connect.\nJohn Griffith: Thanks very much, Ryan.\nRyan Greenwald: Absolutely. I appreciate the update. Just a follow-up and brief on the pension comments. You guys had previously disclosed a  loss through mid-May. What was the pension asset performance through June 30?\nSusan Hardwick : I don't know, Ryan. I mean I don't think it's something we have got at our fingertips. I don't know what you can divine from the Q on that. Yes, we don't have anything out there, Ryan, to answer that specifically.\nRyan Greenwald: Understood. Is it fair to extrapolate the $9 million pension expense from the PA rate case for the balance of the company, assuming PA is like a 20% allocation?\nSusan Hardwick : No.\nRyan Greenwald: Any color on the best way to kind of think about that?\nSusan Hardwick : Well, I think that's a difficult approach. Those are estimated costs as of a set of analyses we did for the rate case. I think the answer really to the question is you really just have to wait until we get to the end of the year, and we see really what the impact is going to be going forward. And I would just reiterate what we said in our prepared remarks that we are working diligently in many of these open cases to address these costs. As Cheryl highlighted several of these jurisdictions have forward-looking test years. And we have worked hard to either include these costs or estimates of these costs in those rate cases or we have proposals on the docket to be able to address go-forward exposures. And to the extent we don't cover those costs timely enough in rate cases, we will continue to focus on ways to mitigate those impacts through other cost management efforts, other things. So I don't think you can really draw any broad conclusions based on what you've seen to date, either in terms of market performance or even in our own filings. I think you really just got to wait until we have more insight into expectations at the end of the year, and then we'll certainly tell you how we think about it. But I'd also tell you, again, remind you that John commented in his remarks, we've affirmed our long-term guidance here. So as we think about this going forward, we're certainly confident in our ability to manage the cost, both from just a straight cost management standpoint and regulatory solutions.\nRyan Greenwald: Understood. And then maybe just lastly, the Pennsylvania Governor's move earlier this month to reduce the corporate tax rate, any initial thoughts on potential impact for you guys in PA there and how this could play into the rate case dynamics?\nSusan Hardwick : I don't really have anything to say about that at the moment. Again, we'd be considering those types of impacts in this current case. So nothing really to comment on there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.\nGregg Orrill: Another one on pension. You talked about the quarter method. What's the size of the quarter that you use?\nSusan Hardwick : Well, I think the sort of standard approach is a 10%.\nGregg Orrill: And that's across -- that's generally across the company? Okay.\nSusan Hardwick : Right. Yes, we have just a single plan, yes.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. While I usually start by reviewing the regulated segment's operating results, I want to start today on Slide 14 by covering the announcement coming from our Military Services Group just a few weeks ago. I'm so proud of MSG's latest award our first ever Navy contract. This contract continues the team's streak of utility privatization wins at military installations in recent years. With the addition of the wastewater contract with Naval Station Mayport, we are currently serving 18 installations with between 30 and 50 years remaining on these contracts. We also have two other bids outstanding, one of which is expected to be awarded in 2023. And as you can see, we have a potential of about 70 additional opportunities in the years ahead. MSG's business model centers around adding new military installations to our portfolio and then optimizing revenues through new infrastructure construction projects on the bases we serve. A military installation's mission can change or expand or new technologies or system improvements may be identified that improve efficiency or sustainability. We work with our military partners to identify and lead these needed infrastructure projects. Again, we're extremely proud to provide vital services for the military personnel, their families and the civilians that support these missions. As we turn to Slide 15, let's cover our regulatory activity in our states. Shown here is our summary of completed rate cases in 2022 and key facts for each of the rate case filings so far this year. In the appendix, we also share some details of changes in our infrastructure charges year-to-date. These key efforts reflect Susan's comment on our team's ability to execute our regulatory strategies. As you can see on the slide, our New Jersey case is the furthest along with constructive discussions happening over the last few months. We're really pleased to report that on July 25, the parties to the New Jersey base rate case filed a stipulation of settlement with the Office of Administrative Law resolving all pending issues in the proceeding. The parties are waiting for an initial decision from the administrative law judge. And once it's issued, the matter will be returned to the Board of Public Utilities for a final determination. In Illinois, it's been about six years since our last general rate case, and progress has been steady since our February filing. Evidentiary hearings will start next month, and we expect an order in the case by January. Importantly, Illinois utilizes a forward test year for ratemaking purposes, which is helpful during this period of rising costs faced by the business. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in late April and are seeking recovery of over $1 billion of investments. The case is proceeding as planned, including evidentiary hearings that will occur in September and with an order in this case also expected early next year. Pennsylvania also uses a forward test year for ratemaking purposes. Our cases in California and Missouri were just filed earlier this month and are progressing as expected so far. And finally, as you know, we have another case active in Virginia from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion in 2023. The common thread in all these cases is the focus on recovery of extensive infrastructure investments totaling over $4 billion and in some cases, the roll-in of acquisitions. As we continue to ramp up capital investments over the next few years, it will take time to see recovery of these investments in rates. We expect to continue to file general rate cases every two to three years in our larger states with the ability to go in sooner if we see lingering inflationary impacts or excessive lag from investment, limiting our ability to earn our allowed return. Clearly, regulatory execution is critical to the success of our plans, and we are very confident in our teams that lead our regulatory efforts. As always, we remain very focused on customer affordability. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies coupled with our customer growth efforts have continued to design and customer assistance programs to help our customer affordability. On the legislative front, there were three additional pieces of legislation passed since our first quarter call, one in Illinois, one in Tennessee and one in Missouri. The Illinois bill is an important one to help address the affordability of our bills with certain customers. The Tennessee bill requires all utilities in the state to implement a cybersecurity plan, and we are well positioned to comply. And lastly, the Missouri bill requires a utility to defer any difference in what was actually paid in state or local property taxes compared to what was used to set the revenue requirement. We believe our legislative efforts benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges. On Slide 16, we summarize rate filings completed so far in 2022 as well as total annualized revenue increases being requested in currently active cases. The total of $598 million in pending cases, which includes 3 infrastructure surcharge proceedings, reflects the requested amounts in the various cases. Generally speaking, we would expect the final revenue increase granted in each case to go into effect in 2023 or 2024 in the case of California. Turning to Slide 7. Our Regulated Business leaders and their teams did a great job again in the second quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It took a significant effort to safely and efficiently complete the several hundred projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $300 million in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2 billion of regulated capital investment spending in 2022, the foundation of our earnings growth triangle. Moving to Slide 18. I want to just highlight that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions are succeeding in growing our regulated rate base. This, of course, drives earnings growth while we remain focused on operating our systems safely and efficiently to the benefit of our customers. Like we have been doing the last several quarters, I'll close on Slide 19 with another story of ESG impact at American Water. This one comes from a collaborative project between New Jersey American Water and NJR Clean Energy Ventures. The partnership is constructing the largest floating solar array in the U.S. on a lake next to our Canoe Brook Water Treatment Plant. Upon completion later this year, this 8.9 megawatt installation will provide 95% of the plant's annual power needs and will help reduce our annual greenhouse gas emissions. This is another example of a project that creates a financial, operational and ESG win for us and our customers. So with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have. Yes, I would just say that we've always got hundreds of projects pretty much ready to go that we know need to be done across our systems. And so we have some flexibility in how quickly we move those projects forward. But at this point, we've been able to manage through any supply chain delays and any cost increases and still get the work that's been prioritized done and continue to do that, we think, through the years coming. So no real concerns there, just being flexible in how we approach those projects. Yes. Thanks, Susan. What EPA put out recently were health advisories. And there's no regulatory requirement for us to test or to meet any certain levels with those health advisories. Those advisories were extremely low, in our opinion, below the detection limit of the methods to test for PFAS compounds. And so we're anxiously waiting to see what EPA comes back out with as far as a real regulatory limit. But we have tested all across our footprint. We know where we stand and we have already started looking at what capital projects would be necessary going forward. And any regulations in states other than where we're at today will mean future capital investments. Yes. We've got two areas in New Jersey where we've seen peak usage rise to the level that we feel it's important that we start to encourage or specifically ask our customers to conserve, to water only on alternating days, put steps like that in place so that we can kind of shave off those peaks and that we can serve our customers continuously without any kind of dips and pressure or anything like that. So we have seen usage spiking, and that's why you're seeing those conservation messages come through. Yes, Michael. We have low-income assistance programs all across our footprint, but we're also looking at how we can expand those or how we can make those more accessible to additional customers. We realize there are just some customers out there that no matter how affordable our bills are, they're going to struggle to be able to do that.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let me also say how happy we are to have John Griffith with us as our CFO, and you'll hear more from John shortly. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. In the first six months of 2022, earnings were $2.07 per share compared to $1.87 per share in the same period of 2021. Results for the Regulated Business drove the majority of the growth, accounting for $0.16 of the $0.20 increase while MSG and other results were up $0.04 as compared to the same period in 2021. The regulated growth was in line with our expectations as we knew the first half of the year would be strong due to revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings completed in 2021 and early 2022 and from infrastructure mechanism filings. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs, which I'll talk more about shortly. Our Regulated Business invested over $800 million in capital projects and acquisitions for the quarter and $1.25 billion year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for executing these investments. As you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2022 included the $235 million acquisition of the City of York's wastewater system that we were excited to close in May. Coupled with our strong first quarter results, our capital investments are off to a good start for the year and on pace to meet our $2.5 billion goal for the year. We continue to stay focused on the plan. And as you saw yesterday, we have now for the third time affirmed our 2022 earnings guidance. And John will cover 2022 results and guidance in more detail a little later in the call. Before I move on, let me comment again about how excited we are to welcome the customers and employees of York's wastewater system to the American Water family. As we've said, this is the largest acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water history, and it's a great example of how municipal acquisitions are executed. The importance of understanding the community's objectives can't be underestimated, and we jointly created an opportunity that benefits all stakeholders. And as we think about the competitive landscape for water and wastewater acquisitions, we continue to focus on growing in states where we can leverage our competitive advantage. As we've said many times before, we target acquisitions in the range of 5,000 to 50,000 customers, where we have constructive regulatory environments, an existing footprint and critical mass. This critical mass is important in our efforts to promote customer affordability and cost efficiencies. Also, as we grow in each state, we will have a greater voice to help solve industry challenges through legislative and regulatory policies. So while we won't be awarded every opportunity we pursue, we know that there are plenty of communities in need, and we believe our 135-plus year history of delivering safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services will enable us to continue to achieve a high success rate in our pursuits. The final highlight I'll cover here is that the Military Services Group had another great win at the end of the second quarter. And I'll let Cheryl give you the details, but the award of our first Navy contract at Mayport adds to the 17 other military installations that we're very proud to serve. Turning to Slide 6. I'll take a few minutes here to provide a review of the macroeconomic environment and how we are managing the impacts to the company. Our focus on operating efficiency is not new, as you know. In the chart at the bottom of Slide 6, you can see the result of our disciplined focus on managing costs as we grow the business. This focus has positioned us well to have managed through much of the pressure so far on supply and even cost increases brought about with the effects of the pandemic. Now as we are in what may be an extended period of inflationary pressure, we continue to exercise our disciplined approach to cost management by leveraging our scale. And through midyear, while we are experiencing cost increases in certain supplies and energy, the impacts to date have been fairly modest. In terms of our most significant costs, labor is our biggest operating expense by far. We work regularly with our union leadership to secure contract renewals. And so far, we have been able to achieve very fair outcomes. For our non-union workforce, we're focused on filling key roles and maintaining our practice of competitive compensation. Chemical costs and purchase power are usually the next biggest operating cost. While our supply chain strategies and purchasing power have helped mitigate chemical cost increases, especially as compared to our peers, we do expect higher O&M costs this year due to higher chemical prices. For many years now, the supply chain team has been successful in partnering with operations to secure reliable, cost-effective power and fleet fuel contracts across our footprint. And because of these efforts, we expect only modest power and fuel cost increases in 2022. Overall, we estimate an impact of about $0.06 to $0.08 per share of these types of cost increases year-to-date, which we've been able to generally offset through other results. Later, John will talk more about the possible impacts on the year. But as I said, we are confident in our ability to hit our earnings expectations for the year. And perhaps one final comment before I talk about how we're pursuing regulatory solutions for this rising production cost environment. Certainly, a lot has been written over the last few weeks about pension accounting and expense levels going forward. I'd simply mention that our pension plans were funded at just under 90% as of year-end 2021 with a roughly 50-50 target allocation for equity and fixed income. Though there has been much volatility in the equity markets through midyear, I'd remind you that the pension obligation remeasurement will be done at the end of 2022, and that will drive the determination of our 2023 expense. The accounting method we use includes using the fair market value of planned assets at year-end to establish the expected return on plan assets. And we also used the quarter approach for amortizing gains and losses. These methods were selected many years ago and have resulted in moderate variability in pension expense, both favorable and unfavorable over the years, which we've always managed as part of our overall cost management approach. This includes regulatory solutions such as the pension trackers we have in place in Missouri and California, and updates to pension expense in active general rate cases. As an example of how we are addressing these costs in current cases in the Illinois case currently on file, we requested and received approval last week to update the requested revenue requirement for increased costs including an estimated increase in pension costs. That request will be considered in this case. And that goes to my final point on this slide around regulatory solutions. Our teams throughout the company know that regulatory execution is vital to meeting our earnings objectives and our financial plan generally. The regulatory solutions we are pursuing such as cost deferrals and expense recovery mechanisms in all of the current active cases are closely aligned with the interest of regulators and customers in managing affordability and limiting variability of customer bills. Therea\u0302\u0080\u0099s no doubt a challenging environment we all find ourselves in, but we remain confident in our ability to manage through it using our disciplined approach to cost management and our ability to execute effectively in the regulatory environment. And with that, let me turn it over to John to cover more detail on our operating results and financing plans. John? Rich, yes, let me make a couple of comments and certainly have John weigh in here. I think we made it hopefully pretty clear in our prepared remarks, first of all, that we affirmed guidance for the year. So as we think about expectations for 2022, we're quite confident in our ability to hit the targets we've established for '22. We did indicate that we continue to see some pressure in headwinds around particularly chemical costs and energy costs. We also highlighted that we're working diligently in the regulatory environment to ensure on a go-forward basis that we have those costs addressed. And as Cheryl pointed out, a number of our cases do have forward-looking test years. So we're hopeful that we can limit any exposure here really to 2022. The other comment that we made, and you obviously rightly pointed out the HOS gain that was recorded, which again, those sorts of transactions are not terribly uncommon when you have a transaction of the size we had last year when we sold HOS, just final working capital true-ups. And I would say they're final. We don't expect any more activity related to that transaction. That was a benefit to the first half of the year that certainly helped us offset some of those cost increases. But I'd also say it's not uncommon for an organization of our size, as John remarked to have pluses and minuses throughout the course of the year. And our focus on cost management, our focus on how we operate, how we are focused on efficiency, we'll continue to have levers that we can pull to offset exposure that we may see in the second half of the year. So that's our plan. And again, I'll just say it again, we affirmed our guidance for 2022, and we fully expect to hit those targets for the year. Yes. And Cheryl can weigh in here too from an operating standpoint, but we don't see any change at all in our plans in terms of the amount of work we're doing. We may see some cost increases there on pipe. But I would tell you, again, our supply chain folks have done a tremendous job, both managing the availability of supply and the cost increases we've experienced. They really have been fairly modest on those types of commodities. And again, we don't expect any change in our plans to invest. Cheryl, anything to add there? No, not at this time. Obviously, as we said in our prepared remarks, we do need to get to the end of the year, we'll do the remeasurement there, and we'll see where we are. But again, our focus would be to use all of the tools at our disposal to manage those types of increases I mentioned in my remarks around regulatory approaches. We've got trackers in two states already, so that will mitigate it there in two of our largest states, by the way. And we're continuing to focus on regulatory solutions in all the cases we have currently on file to address that specific cost. So we're optimistic we'll be able to manage through whatever increases we may or may not see there. I don't think you should assume that. What we tried to point out on Slide 10 is simply the reality of our earnings profile. We're pointing out that in the prior year, you would have had results from New York. We just didn't want folks to miss that as you think about what your expectations are for each of the remaining two quarters. And then we obviously have talked about inflation here and our -- the headwinds we may experience. And again, our strategy is to try to offset those impacts. What we've continued to say is we've affirmed our guidance for 2022, and we're very confident in our ability to hit that. Exactly. Yes, it's a good question. And so obviously, it's something that we're very focused on, and I'm going to let Cheryl comment on how we see this latest news. Angie, I'll let Cheryl comment in a minute about what's specifically happening in New Jersey. We haven't really seen to date through June much of a weather impact. We're all, I think, across the country sort of sweating this quarter. So we'll see what it does to results here in this third quarter. Yes, we've probably moved away from that sort of quantification, I think what we've historically done there. So we'll just need to wait and see what impact it does have on demand in this quarter. And Cheryl, do you want to talk specifically about what's going on in New Jersey? Yes. It's a good -- yes, sure. It's a good question. And obviously, we need to kind of dust off our analysis that has been done around this topic again. And as you said, it's sort of back new in the news. And I think as we've talked about this in the past, it really is probably an impact on cash flow primarily. Ultimately, any impacts to effective tax rates gets worked through the customer bills. So I would say it's probably cash flow -- and I think -- well, again, just need to look at our analysis that we did at the time. I don't recall it being terribly material, but we'll just need to dust it off and see if there's anything there to report. Well, yes, sure. I'm obviously not going to comment on any details here. I would simply say it's never that simple. I think it's important to go back to the comments that John made in his prepared remarks that we've got a pipeline at 1.3. We just closed New York. We talked about the acquisition in West Virginia we just announced yesterday. We have plenty to do in this space. There is plenty to do, and we are doing a lot. So we take every opportunity seriously, and we approach every one with the same rigor, the same metrics, the same approach to benefits that can be provided to communities, and we put our best foot forward and then we move on. And that's probably all I have to say about that. Again, we've got lots of great opportunities here. I don't know, Ryan. I mean I don't think it's something we have got at our fingertips. I don't know what you can divine from the Q on that. Yes, we don't have anything out there, Ryan, to answer that specifically. No. Well, I think that's a difficult approach. Those are estimated costs as of a set of analyses we did for the rate case. I think the answer really to the question is you really just have to wait until we get to the end of the year, and we see really what the impact is going to be going forward. And I would just reiterate what we said in our prepared remarks that we are working diligently in many of these open cases to address these costs. As Cheryl highlighted several of these jurisdictions have forward-looking test years. And we have worked hard to either include these costs or estimates of these costs in those rate cases or we have proposals on the docket to be able to address go-forward exposures. And to the extent we don't cover those costs timely enough in rate cases, we will continue to focus on ways to mitigate those impacts through other cost management efforts, other things. So I don't think you can really draw any broad conclusions based on what you've seen to date, either in terms of market performance or even in our own filings. I think you really just got to wait until we have more insight into expectations at the end of the year, and then we'll certainly tell you how we think about it. But I'd also tell you, again, remind you that John commented in his remarks, we've affirmed our long-term guidance here. So as we think about this going forward, we're certainly confident in our ability to manage the cost, both from just a straight cost management standpoint and regulatory solutions. I don't really have anything to say about that at the moment. Again, we'd be considering those types of impacts in this current case. So nothing really to comment on there. Well, I think the sort of standard approach is a 10%. Right. Yes, we have just a single plan, yes."

            "name": "John Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. I recall Susan saying on the first quarter earnings call that it had been a privilege to serve as CFO where she was thrilled it was her last one in the role. So before I get started with the results, let me just say that I am thrilled to take the baton from Susan as CFO at American Water and join this great team. So with that, turning to Slide 8, let me provide a few more details on second quarter results. Regulated results in total increased $0.02 per share compared to the prior year. We saw a $0.16 per share increase related to higher revenues from new rates, acquisitions and organic growth. As a reminder, prior year results reflect an estimated $0.03 per share of favourable weather in the second quarter. O&M expense increased by $0.06 per share, which reflects some of the effects of inflation on chemical, power and fuel costs. Depreciation expense increased $0.03 per share in support of growth in the Regulated Business. The Market-Based Business and Other results increased $0.04 per share in the second quarter of 2022 as compared to the second quarter of 2021. These results in 2022 include interest income on the seller note and earnings from revenue share agreements from the 2021 sale of Homeowner Services of $0.06 per share while 2021 results included $0.08 per share of operating earnings from HOS. Results for the Other segment also include interest expense on long-term debt financing in both periods, which has increased year-over-year. Related to HOS, I also wanted to note that we recorded the final working capital true-up entries for HOS in the first half of the year amounting to $0.08 of earnings. As we previously disclosed, we recorded a $0.02 loss on the sale of New York American Water in the first quarter. As is often the case with an organization of our size, it is common to have in any given year a number of pluses and minuses that generally offset. The net earnings contribution of $0.06 per share from these final two sale-related entries has helped to mitigate the impact of the inflationary pressures we have seen so far. Moving to Slide 9. Consolidated results increased $0.20 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. Results from the Regulated Business increased $0.16 per share for the year-to-date period. We saw a 34% -- $0.34 per share increase on higher revenues, somewhat offset by increases in O&M and other operating expenses of $0.08 per share and depreciation of $0.06 per share. The Market-Based Businesses and Other results increased $0.04 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, with generally the same drivers as mentioned for the second quarter results. Overall, we're pleased with our financial performance over the first half of the year. The first half performance sets us up well to deliver on our full year financial plan. Speaking of our 2022 plan, let's now turn to Slide 10. After a solid start to the year, as Susan mentioned, we are affirming our 2022 earnings guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. We expect strong revenue growth to continue in the second half of the year as we continue to earn returns on our infrastructure investments from prior years and see additional growth from acquisitions. Second half results when compared to the prior year will be tempered by the sale of our New York American Water operations earlier this year, which historically had its biggest earnings contribution in the third quarter of each year. And as we mentioned, while we are working diligently to limit the impacts to the business of rising costs, we expect to see continued pressures in the second half of the year, primarily related to chemicals and interest expense. As we've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of sale proceeds for HOS in New York,; but the expected earnings from interest on the seller note and revenue from the utility revenue share agreements will nearly offset the loss of the prior annual earnings contribution from HOS. As our team has previously shared, we'll continue to ramp up our capital investments over the next few years as a part of the accelerated investment plan rolled out last November. The earnings from that ramp-up of investment will follow. Finally, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we have in place, including 7% to 9% EPS growth and 8% to 9% rate base growth. We acknowledge the current macroeconomic headwinds and are factoring those in as we progress through our annual budgeting and planning process this summer. As expected, we will provide an updated outlook later this year for 2023 and the longer term. Turning to Slide 11 and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle. We were pleased to announce in May our closing of the purchase of our -- of the purchase of the City of York's wastewater system for $235 million where we are now serving approximately 45,000 customer connections. This agreement was executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation, which is a framework that exists now across 12 of the states in which we operate. Turning to a review of the nearly 30,000 customer connections under agreement as of June 30, Egg Harbor City is expected to close in the second half of 2022. Egg Harbor City is the first transaction under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act. Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future as it allows communities with significant operating challenges to avoid a public referendum and swiftly partner with a provider like us to address their issues. And just yesterday, West Virginia American Water announced a signed agreement with Jefferson Utilities to purchase the various water and wastewater system assets of Jefferson Utilities for $30 million. The combined systems serve almost 4,000 customer connections in West Virginia and we expect to close this transaction by the end of this year. The acquisition pipeline is still quite strong at approximately 1.3 million customer connections. The pipeline represents a multitude of potential acquisitions across many states in our footprint, including several additional opportunities that have emerged since our last call as well as the removal of two large deals, York now closed, and another opportunity in Pennsylvania. Let's move to Slide 12 and a reminder that we have a strong balance sheet and credit profile. I believe that our plan, both the level of investment and how we intend to finance it, is supportive of our current credit ratings. This includes the $1.1 billion of equity financing we have previously discussed as we focus on achieving our long-term debt-to-capital target of 60%. We will continue to work hard at maintaining our industry-leading credit ratings for the benefit, ultimately, of our customers. Importantly, these strong issuer ratings are also applied to our senior unsecured debt offerings enabling us to achieve strong financing outcomes like our recent debt offering in May, that's summarized in the appendix of today's slides. The other thing I'll point out on this slide is our debt maturity profile on the bottom left of the slide. In a rising interest rate environment, it is important that the company has taken a laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years in order to minimize interest rate risk. I certainly agree with that strategy and expect to continue that wise approach. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to cover our capital investments and Military Services Group results in more detail. Cheryl? Thanks very much, Ryan."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to American Water's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American's Investor Relations website. I'd now like to introduce your host for today's call, Mr. Aaron Musgrave, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may now begin.\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Nick. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future event, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risk, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risk, uncertainties and factors as well as the more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the earnings release and on our March 31, 2022 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. All statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO and CFO will discuss first quarter financial results 2022 earnings and long-term guidance and our commitment to ESG principles. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then review our regulated growth strategy, including capital investments and regulatory proceedings in the first quarter. Susan will then comment on some exciting news we shared yesterday regarding our executive management team, before closing by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water President CEO and CFO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Aaron said, I'll comment further in just a few minutes about recent announced additions to our executive team. But I want to start by saying what a privilege it has been to serve as the company's CFO these past three years. But I also must say I'm thrilled that this will be my last call as the CFO. Let's turn to slide five and six and I'll start by covering our first quarter financial results and then share some business highlights to start the year. In the first quarter of 2022, earnings were $0.87 per share, compared to $0.73 per share in the same period of 2021. Results for the regulated business drove all of the increase of $0.14 per share while market based business and other results were essentially flat as compared to the same period in 2021. Regulator results for the quarter reflect revenue increases from several general rate proceedings completed in 2021 and early 2022, as well as from infrastructure mechanism filings. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher depreciation and increased production costs due to some inflationary pressures on chemicals and energy prices. Market based businesses and other results were similar in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, with a loss of $2 million, or $0.01 per share in both of those periods. But in those results, the $0.07 per share of earnings from HOS in 2021, was mostly offset in 2022 by the interest income and earnings from the revenue sharing agreements in place as a result of the sale of HOS late last year. While we're currently reflecting the interest income and revenue share contributions in other, they really do represent results driven by the regulated business. And will even more so once the proceeds of the note receivable from the sale are received and redeployed into regulated capital investment. We will continue to report these pieces separately so that it's easy to track. Finally, our military services group had similar results in both quarters and our MSG team continues to expect an announcement on the Naval Station Mayport, Florida bid this summer. In addition to the strong quarter of earnings growth, our regulated business invested $437 million in capital projects and acquisitions in the quarter. This is a great start to the year and puts us on pace to meet our $2.5 billion capital investment goal in 2022. I may sound like a broken record here. But as we've said last year, when we announced our stepped up capital spending plan, the increasing levels of investment will continue to ramp up during this year and over the next few years. And it will take time to see recovery of those investments in rates. We're now in the regulatory cycle that we've talked about before with general rate cases being filed every two to three years in our larger states. We've already announced rates case filings in New Jersey and Illinois earlier this year, which are proceeding as expected. We'll be filing a general rate case in Pennsylvania tomorrow and our next case in California next week which follows the statutory cycle there. In aggregate, we expect to file five to six general cases in 2022, seeking to earn a return on over $4 billion of investment. Clearly, regulatory execution is critical to the success of our plans. Let me make one more comment on our investment progress before I move on. As you will recall, the $2.5 billion total capital investment plan for 2022 includes the $235 million anticipated acquisition of the city of York's wastewater system that we're very excited about. We're also excited though about the 30 other acquisitions across several states we have under agreement as of March 31. They demonstrate that the acquisition pipeline is quite strong. Turning to slide 7, after a strong start to the year, we are affirming our 2022 guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. As we shared in February, our expected regulated earnings growth range in 2022 of $0.24 to $0.30 reflects new authorized rate levels in several jurisdictions. As expected, we saw much of that revenue increase related to new rates in the first quarter of 2022, including in Pennsylvania, which recorded a full quarter of the base rate increase from last year, as well as the step increase effective January 1 of this year. We also experienced about $0.03 per share of timing favorability for operating costs in the first quarter of \u201822 that we expect to reverse in later quarters. As I've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of the sale proceeds from HOS and New York. But the expected earnings from interest on the seller note and revenue from the utility share agreements will nearly offset the loss of the prior annual earnings contribution from HOS. Finally, on slide 7, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we set forth in November, including 7% to 9% EPS growth for 2026. Moving on to slide 8, as we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.6025 per share to $0.6550 per share, and nearly 9% increase, including this year's expected increase, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 9.6% over the last several years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. We plan to grow the dividend at the high end of the 7% to 10% range as we know that is important to many of our shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Cheryl, I want to cover a few important points related to our industry leadership in ESG. Coming in May, we plan to issue our Second Annual Inclusion, Diversity and Equity report. This report will highlight the efforts we have undertaken and the strides we have made advancing our commitment to building an inclusive workplace. Within the report, you will find our first disclosure of consolidated EEO 1 data for American Water. Based on feedback from shareholders and ESG best practices, we made a commitment in our recently filed proxy statement to begin disclosing this data annually in 2022 and thereafter. This action will deliver on that commitment. We are also pleased to be publishing in May the second annual installment of our ESG data summary which will be found on the sustainability page of our Investor Relations website. The data summary will share numerous metrics for calendar year 2021, including scope, one and scope two emissions and progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. As many of American Water has achieved significant greenhouse gas emission reductions over the last decade. Due to the nature of our business and our emission reductions over the years, we are in a great position relative to a large majority of our utility peers. For example, we're able to talk about our emissions footprint and hundreds of 1000s of metric tons, whereas most other utilities talk in terms of millions of metric tons. Last year, we came closer to achieving our current goal, we began the process of evaluating new greenhouse gas emission targets. This evaluation is well underway by a large cross functional team and is running in parallel with our annual planning process. They are focused on diligent study and analysis including the potential addition of a scope three emissions and potential alignment with the Paris Agreement. The team expects to present its findings and recommendations to management and the board later this year. I wanted to share this update with you today to demonstrate our commitment to transparency as one of the top ESG leaders in the industry. And with that let me turn the call over to Cheryl to cover in more detail our operating results and strategies for \u201922. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 11, our regulated business leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It took a significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the dozens of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $100 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2 billion of regulated capital investment spending in 2022. Turning to slide 12, shown here is our summary of rate case filings and legislative updates. On the legislative front, there are three pieces of legislation that have passed so far this year, two in Indiana and one in Virginia. The Virginia Bill is an important confirmation of the use of standalone state specific capital structure in ratemaking proceedings for investor owned utilities. The two Indiana bills provide constructive outcomes around recovery of property taxes, as well as promoting sound, safety and asset management practices by all utilities in the state. We believe our legislative efforts benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges. And you can find in the appendix to today's presentation, a summary of some of our key legislative outcomes in the states we serve. You can also see on slide 12 as Susan previously indicated, this is a very busy year for general rate cases. We filed two cases already in 2022 in New Jersey and Illinois. These two filings were driven by recovery of the extensive capital investments we've made since the last cases in those states, totaling more than $2 billion combined. In New Jersey, this includes a filter rehabilitation project to improve water quality at the Raritan millstone plant serving more than 1 million people, as well as projects to improve water quality at dozens of wells, pumping stations and other critical facilities serving customers throughout New Jersey. In Illinois, investments include the replacement, lining and installation of approximately 141 miles of aging water and wastewater pipelines, as well as the role of near rolling of nearly 30 acquisitions since the last general rate case. And as Susan mentioned, we expect to file three to four more cases this year, including the case in Pennsylvania tomorrow, where we'll be seeking recovery of over $1 billion of investments. Next week, we'll also be making an initial filing related to our general rate case in California, which is in keeping with the state's three year cycle, the California case will seek to recover nearly $600 million of forecasted capital investments and will include several closed and pending acquisitions. In addition, we will be filing notice with the Missouri Public Service Commission tomorrow that we plan to file a case by mid-year. And finally, as you know, we have three active cases from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion this year. Moving to slide 13. To date, we have a total annualized revenue request of $220 million in pending cases, which includes two infrastructure surcharge proceedings, already in rates is $79 million in annualized new revenues since January of 2021. This includes $48 million from general rate cases and step increases, excluding the agreed reduction in revenues for excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $31 million from infrastructure surcharges. For the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to roll in infrastructure investment and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for earnings growth. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in constructive outcomes. And as always, we remain very focused on customer affordability. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies, coupled with our customer growth efforts have continued to deliver very affordable bills as a percentage of household income for most of our customers. We also continue to evolve our strategies around rate designed to assist our low income customers who are challenged with affordability. These efforts in addition to our historical customer assistance programs, as well as the programs we're implementing across our footprint funded by the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. These programs have already provided millions of dollars of support to our customers, and we support their continued funding. Turning to slide 14, and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle, we were excited to announce on April 14 that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our application to purchase the city of York's wastewater system for $235 million, signed just one year ago, York is the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water\u2019s history and as being executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation. We're thrilled to soon be serving approximately 45,000 customers there, and we expect to close the acquisition by or before mid-June. Another acquisition under agreement is Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, which is the first transaction under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act. Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future, as it allows communities with significant operating challenges to swiftly partner with a provider like us to address this issues. Egg Harbor City represents about 3,000 customer connections, and we also expect to close on this acquisition later this year. Finally, still on the acquisition front, a smaller but important one is the water system we are acquiring from the town of Waverly, Virginia that we expect to close in the next few months. This represents our first acquisition in Virginia under the fair market value legislation that was finalized in October of 2022. As a result, the pending closing is an important milestone as we work through this process for the first time in the state. I'll close on slide 15, with a project coming from our military services group that illustrates another example of ESG impact as a result of American Water\u2019s investment. MSG partnered with Hill Air Force Base in Utah to construct a net zero operation center to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions there. The building design focused on both reducing energy usage and also offsetting energy usage with solar panels. After project completion, the building not only met all of its power supply needs, but also sent power back to the grid. This project is just one example of the many projects MSG undertakes at the 17 military installations it serves across the country that creates a financial win for both sides and an environmental win for us all. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Susan for some closing remarks. Susan?\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks Cheryl. Turning to our final slide, slide 16. And before we begin Q&A, I want to comment further on our announcement of the hiring of a CFO. As I'm sure you saw yesterday, we announced that John Griffith will be joining American Water as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective May 16. John comes to us from Bank of America and brings more than 25 years of industry knowledge and financial and transactional expertise. I personally know John and his capabilities, he is very talented and will bring the right skills at the right time to help American Water continue its journey of strategic execution, and delivery of superior results. As John joins us, our senior executive team is now fully in place. If you recall, Jim Gallegos, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel joined us on April 1 of this year, Jim brings nearly 20 years of regulated general counsel expertise and is already integrating nicely into the organization. We are thrilled to have both John and Jim on board now. As I've said before, I'm confident in the plan that we have in place to grow this business. And I'm confident we have the right teams in place throughout our states at the basis we serve, and here in our corporate office to achieve our goals in 2022 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and we'll be happy to take your questions.\nOperator:  First question comes from Rebecca Yuan, Goldman Sachs.\nRebecca Yuan: Hi, thanks. Good morning. So first question, are there any changes to your equity issuance plans, both in terms of the $1.1 billion magnitude and timing in the middle of the five year range?\nSusan Hardwick: Good morning. No, no expected changes to that plan.\nRebecca Yuan: Okay, great. And then my second question, given the current inflationary environment, are Munis more willing to sell their utilities? Are you seeing any of that or potential opportunities to accelerate some tuck-ins?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, we certainly think that is going to contribute to issues that municipals will face. We haven't seen any specific opportunities pop-up because of that. But we do know that those are factors that will weigh heavily on some of these communities and their analysis and assessment of their opportunity to sell to American Water. And Cheryl, anything to add from your perspective on that.\nCheryl Norton: No, not really, Susan. As you said, we haven't seen anybody specifically come forward related to that. But we do know those pressures are very real and we're able to manage them because of our size and scope where a lot of the Municipals are going to struggle with that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ryan Greenwald of Bank of America.\nRyan Greenwald: Hey, good morning, everyone. Congratulations on new hiring. So appreciate the color around the O&M timing. Can you guys just talk a bit more about how the quarter shook out relative your expectations? Any other particular considerations that are making you guy\u2019s kind of hold guidance in place after what appears to be a pretty strong quarter to start the year here?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, Ryan, I think relative to expectations this quarter was right on target. As we said, in the call, we did have a couple of timing items, not terribly material. But really what drove the quarter was revenue associated with all the regulatory proceedings that we've been in the process of executing. And if you recall, the largest piece of that is the Pennsylvania rate increase that was effective January 28 of 2021. So this year, of course, reflects a full quarters worth of revenues associated with that increase. And obviously, that was a big driver year-over-year for the quarter. So again, the quarter for us was a very good one, but it reflected full execution on our plan, and really met our expectations. And as we said, our expectations for the year remain the same. We're very confident about our ability to deliver on the plan we have laid out for \u201822.\nRyan Greenwald: Excellent. And then can you guy just provide an update on Chester from your vantage point where things are in the process, timeline resolution, overall conviction levels to close the transaction?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, not a whole lot to add. Not much new from our side on that. But I'll let Cheryl make a couple comments there.\nCheryl Norton: Yes, so obviously, kind of held up in the courts, if you will. I think we're, I don't anticipate seeing anything probably it's possible this year, but it's going to be months out for sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shar Pourreza of Guggenheim.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey, guys, it's actually a Chen for Shar. Good morning. So I guess just wanted to build off the prior question. It looks like the customer connections for the year is a little ahead of target. Just more broadly, are you seeing increasing competition for some of these muni acquisitions?\nSusan Hardwick: I'd say generally, yes. In certain of our jurisdictions, we have seen certainly more competition here in the northeast, we continue to believe that we are the preferred provider and should be, we have the scale and the scope necessary to address many of the issues that these municipals face. And we have the expertise that we've demonstrated in a number of transactions throughout our service territory that really proves that, in fact, we are the best provider in all of these situations. So certainly more competition. But we remain very confident in our ability to deliver the needed services for some of these communities that need help.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent. And like it's just building on the prior one as well, just on the supply chain side, as we think about O&M for the rest of the year. Anything that you've seen in the first quarter that gives you caution one way or the other or anything that we should think about as we look at the rest of year?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, it's a good question. Obviously, there's still lots of impacts being felt throughout the economy. And we certainly are not immune to that. Although, I would say we're in a better position than most just given our size and scale and our ability to sort of mass purchase products that we need. There are some supply chain bottlenecks, I'd say around certain items that we use, but we've actually seen a bit of an improvement in the supply. And some of those critical items, we've seen price increases, but we've actually seen the rate of those increases start to slow down a bit, which is a positive sign. And again, just given our size and scale, we've certainly been able to manage through that so far. And we'll continue to focus on all things we can do to help mitigate those impacts and ultimately, the impacts to customers.\nUnidentified Analyst: Excellent, thanks. So I'll just echo Ryan and say congrats on the new hires.\nOperator: Next question will be from Gregg Orrill of UBS.\nGregg Orrill: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could put into context, sort of the backlog of rate cases that you have right now relative to your sort of 7% to 9% earnings growth target, is it-- when you think about Pennsylvania and California, and what's already outstanding, do you think that could take you above trend? Or is that kind of what we're expecting? Or is there even sort of momentum that's continuing to build there?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, it's a good question. I would just tell you that our current regulatory schedule, or activity is really according to our plan. We have signaled, I think for some time that you can expect us to be in the regulatory arena regularly. And certainly on our larger stage, every two to three years, we would expect to be in for general rate increases every two to three years. And I think that's reflective, also of just the level of capital spending. As you know, we have increased our spend trajectory in this last plan update we did in November. So that just again, underscores our approach to regulatory recovery, and the cycle on which we will execute that. I think it's also important to note that we have very effective mechanisms in many of our jurisdictions. And I think we're somewhere in the 65% range or so of our spend gets recovered through those mechanisms, which certainly helps on the regulatory lag side, from an earnings perspective, and helps the customer I think, sort of better plan for rate increases coming their way. So we take advantage of all those things and use those as effectively as we can to execute on the strategy. Now, long answer to your question. Short answer is, it is according to the plan, and we've continued to execute according to that plan.\nOperator: It concludes the question-and-answer session, and also concludes the conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Susan, and good morning everyone. Turning to slide 11, our regulated business leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It took a significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the dozens of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $100 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2 billion of regulated capital investment spending in 2022. Turning to slide 12, shown here is our summary of rate case filings and legislative updates. On the legislative front, there are three pieces of legislation that have passed so far this year, two in Indiana and one in Virginia. The Virginia Bill is an important confirmation of the use of standalone state specific capital structure in ratemaking proceedings for investor owned utilities. The two Indiana bills provide constructive outcomes around recovery of property taxes, as well as promoting sound, safety and asset management practices by all utilities in the state. We believe our legislative efforts benefit our customers and give communities more options as they seek solutions to water and wastewater challenges. And you can find in the appendix to today's presentation, a summary of some of our key legislative outcomes in the states we serve. You can also see on slide 12 as Susan previously indicated, this is a very busy year for general rate cases. We filed two cases already in 2022 in New Jersey and Illinois. These two filings were driven by recovery of the extensive capital investments we've made since the last cases in those states, totaling more than $2 billion combined. In New Jersey, this includes a filter rehabilitation project to improve water quality at the Raritan millstone plant serving more than 1 million people, as well as projects to improve water quality at dozens of wells, pumping stations and other critical facilities serving customers throughout New Jersey. In Illinois, investments include the replacement, lining and installation of approximately 141 miles of aging water and wastewater pipelines, as well as the role of near rolling of nearly 30 acquisitions since the last general rate case. And as Susan mentioned, we expect to file three to four more cases this year, including the case in Pennsylvania tomorrow, where we'll be seeking recovery of over $1 billion of investments. Next week, we'll also be making an initial filing related to our general rate case in California, which is in keeping with the state's three year cycle, the California case will seek to recover nearly $600 million of forecasted capital investments and will include several closed and pending acquisitions. In addition, we will be filing notice with the Missouri Public Service Commission tomorrow that we plan to file a case by mid-year. And finally, as you know, we have three active cases from 2021 that we expect to bring to conclusion this year. Moving to slide 13. To date, we have a total annualized revenue request of $220 million in pending cases, which includes two infrastructure surcharge proceedings, already in rates is $79 million in annualized new revenues since January of 2021. This includes $48 million from general rate cases and step increases, excluding the agreed reduction in revenues for excess accumulated deferred income taxes and $31 million from infrastructure surcharges. For the remainder of the year, we expect to file additional general rate cases to roll in infrastructure investment and acquisitions since the last cases. As always, execution on these regulatory priorities is key to our plan for earnings growth. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in constructive outcomes. And as always, we remain very focused on customer affordability. Our emphasis on cost and capital efficiencies, coupled with our customer growth efforts have continued to deliver very affordable bills as a percentage of household income for most of our customers. We also continue to evolve our strategies around rate designed to assist our low income customers who are challenged with affordability. These efforts in addition to our historical customer assistance programs, as well as the programs we're implementing across our footprint funded by the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act. These programs have already provided millions of dollars of support to our customers, and we support their continued funding. Turning to slide 14, and the acquisition piece of our growth triangle, we were excited to announce on April 14 that the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission approved our application to purchase the city of York's wastewater system for $235 million, signed just one year ago, York is the largest municipal acquisition in Pennsylvania American Water's history and as being executed under Pennsylvania's fair market value legislation. We're thrilled to soon be serving approximately 45,000 customers there, and we expect to close the acquisition by or before mid-June. Another acquisition under agreement is Egg Harbor City, New Jersey, which is the first transaction under the New Jersey Water Infrastructure Protection Act. Importantly, we believe other municipalities will benefit by this legislation in the future, as it allows communities with significant operating challenges to swiftly partner with a provider like us to address this issues. Egg Harbor City represents about 3,000 customer connections, and we also expect to close on this acquisition later this year. Finally, still on the acquisition front, a smaller but important one is the water system we are acquiring from the town of Waverly, Virginia that we expect to close in the next few months. This represents our first acquisition in Virginia under the fair market value legislation that was finalized in October of 2022. As a result, the pending closing is an important milestone as we work through this process for the first time in the state. I'll close on slide 15, with a project coming from our military services group that illustrates another example of ESG impact as a result of American Water's investment. MSG partnered with Hill Air Force Base in Utah to construct a net zero operation center to enhance energy efficiency and reduce emissions there. The building design focused on both reducing energy usage and also offsetting energy usage with solar panels. After project completion, the building not only met all of its power supply needs, but also sent power back to the grid. This project is just one example of the many projects MSG undertakes at the 17 military installations it serves across the country that creates a financial win for both sides and an environmental win for us all. With that, I'll now turn it back over to Susan for some closing remarks. Susan? No, not really, Susan. As you said, we haven't seen anybody specifically come forward related to that. But we do know those pressures are very real and we're able to manage them because of our size and scope where a lot of the Municipals are going to struggle with that. Yes, so obviously, kind of held up in the courts, if you will. I think we're, I don't anticipate seeing anything probably it's possible this year, but it's going to be months out for sure."

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As Aaron said, I'll comment further in just a few minutes about recent announced additions to our executive team. But I want to start by saying what a privilege it has been to serve as the company's CFO these past three years. But I also must say I'm thrilled that this will be my last call as the CFO. Let's turn to slide five and six and I'll start by covering our first quarter financial results and then share some business highlights to start the year. In the first quarter of 2022, earnings were $0.87 per share, compared to $0.73 per share in the same period of 2021. Results for the regulated business drove all of the increase of $0.14 per share while market based business and other results were essentially flat as compared to the same period in 2021. Regulator results for the quarter reflect revenue increases from several general rate proceedings completed in 2021 and early 2022, as well as from infrastructure mechanism filings. These higher revenues were partially offset by higher depreciation and increased production costs due to some inflationary pressures on chemicals and energy prices. Market based businesses and other results were similar in the first quarter of 2022 and 2021, with a loss of $2 million, or $0.01 per share in both of those periods. But in those results, the $0.07 per share of earnings from HOS in 2021, was mostly offset in 2022 by the interest income and earnings from the revenue sharing agreements in place as a result of the sale of HOS late last year. While we're currently reflecting the interest income and revenue share contributions in other, they really do represent results driven by the regulated business. And will even more so once the proceeds of the note receivable from the sale are received and redeployed into regulated capital investment. We will continue to report these pieces separately so that it's easy to track. Finally, our military services group had similar results in both quarters and our MSG team continues to expect an announcement on the Naval Station Mayport, Florida bid this summer. In addition to the strong quarter of earnings growth, our regulated business invested $437 million in capital projects and acquisitions in the quarter. This is a great start to the year and puts us on pace to meet our $2.5 billion capital investment goal in 2022. I may sound like a broken record here. But as we've said last year, when we announced our stepped up capital spending plan, the increasing levels of investment will continue to ramp up during this year and over the next few years. And it will take time to see recovery of those investments in rates. We're now in the regulatory cycle that we've talked about before with general rate cases being filed every two to three years in our larger states. We've already announced rates case filings in New Jersey and Illinois earlier this year, which are proceeding as expected. We'll be filing a general rate case in Pennsylvania tomorrow and our next case in California next week which follows the statutory cycle there. In aggregate, we expect to file five to six general cases in 2022, seeking to earn a return on over $4 billion of investment. Clearly, regulatory execution is critical to the success of our plans. Let me make one more comment on our investment progress before I move on. As you will recall, the $2.5 billion total capital investment plan for 2022 includes the $235 million anticipated acquisition of the city of York's wastewater system that we're very excited about. We're also excited though about the 30 other acquisitions across several states we have under agreement as of March 31. They demonstrate that the acquisition pipeline is quite strong. Turning to slide 7, after a strong start to the year, we are affirming our 2022 guidance range of $4.39 per share to $4.49 per share. As we shared in February, our expected regulated earnings growth range in 2022 of $0.24 to $0.30 reflects new authorized rate levels in several jurisdictions. As expected, we saw much of that revenue increase related to new rates in the first quarter of 2022, including in Pennsylvania, which recorded a full quarter of the base rate increase from last year, as well as the step increase effective January 1 of this year. We also experienced about $0.03 per share of timing favorability for operating costs in the first quarter of \u201822 that we expect to reverse in later quarters. As I've mentioned previously, we will not see any material earnings in 2022 from the redeployment of the sale proceeds from HOS and New York. But the expected earnings from interest on the seller note and revenue from the utility share agreements will nearly offset the loss of the prior annual earnings contribution from HOS. Finally, on slide 7, I'll just reiterate that we are confident in the long-term financial targets we set forth in November, including 7% to 9% EPS growth for 2026. Moving on to slide 8, as we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend payment from $0.6025 per share to $0.6550 per share, and nearly 9% increase, including this year's expected increase, we have grown our dividend at a compound annual growth rate of 9.6% over the last several years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. We plan to grow the dividend at the high end of the 7% to 10% range as we know that is important to many of our shareholders. Before I turn the call over to Cheryl, I want to cover a few important points related to our industry leadership in ESG. Coming in May, we plan to issue our Second Annual Inclusion, Diversity and Equity report. This report will highlight the efforts we have undertaken and the strides we have made advancing our commitment to building an inclusive workplace. Within the report, you will find our first disclosure of consolidated EEO 1 data for American Water. Based on feedback from shareholders and ESG best practices, we made a commitment in our recently filed proxy statement to begin disclosing this data annually in 2022 and thereafter. This action will deliver on that commitment. We are also pleased to be publishing in May the second annual installment of our ESG data summary which will be found on the sustainability page of our Investor Relations website. The data summary will share numerous metrics for calendar year 2021, including scope, one and scope two emissions and progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. As many of American Water has achieved significant greenhouse gas emission reductions over the last decade. Due to the nature of our business and our emission reductions over the years, we are in a great position relative to a large majority of our utility peers. For example, we're able to talk about our emissions footprint and hundreds of 1000s of metric tons, whereas most other utilities talk in terms of millions of metric tons. Last year, we came closer to achieving our current goal, we began the process of evaluating new greenhouse gas emission targets. This evaluation is well underway by a large cross functional team and is running in parallel with our annual planning process. They are focused on diligent study and analysis including the potential addition of a scope three emissions and potential alignment with the Paris Agreement. The team expects to present its findings and recommendations to management and the board later this year. I wanted to share this update with you today to demonstrate our commitment to transparency as one of the top ESG leaders in the industry. And with that let me turn the call over to Cheryl to cover in more detail our operating results and strategies for '22. Cheryl? Thanks Cheryl. Turning to our final slide, slide 16. And before we begin Q&A, I want to comment further on our announcement of the hiring of a CFO. As I'm sure you saw yesterday, we announced that John Griffith will be joining American Water as our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer effective May 16. John comes to us from Bank of America and brings more than 25 years of industry knowledge and financial and transactional expertise. I personally know John and his capabilities, he is very talented and will bring the right skills at the right time to help American Water continue its journey of strategic execution, and delivery of superior results. As John joins us, our senior executive team is now fully in place. If you recall, Jim Gallegos, our Executive Vice President and General Counsel joined us on April 1 of this year, Jim brings nearly 20 years of regulated general counsel expertise and is already integrating nicely into the organization. We are thrilled to have both John and Jim on board now. As I've said before, I'm confident in the plan that we have in place to grow this business. And I'm confident we have the right teams in place throughout our states at the basis we serve, and here in our corporate office to achieve our goals in 2022 and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and we'll be happy to take your questions. Good morning. No, no expected changes to that plan. Well, we certainly think that is going to contribute to issues that municipals will face. We haven't seen any specific opportunities pop-up because of that. But we do know that those are factors that will weigh heavily on some of these communities and their analysis and assessment of their opportunity to sell to American Water. And Cheryl, anything to add from your perspective on that. Well, Ryan, I think relative to expectations this quarter was right on target. As we said, in the call, we did have a couple of timing items, not terribly material. But really what drove the quarter was revenue associated with all the regulatory proceedings that we've been in the process of executing. And if you recall, the largest piece of that is the Pennsylvania rate increase that was effective January 28 of 2021. So this year, of course, reflects a full quarters worth of revenues associated with that increase. And obviously, that was a big driver year-over-year for the quarter. So again, the quarter for us was a very good one, but it reflected full execution on our plan, and really met our expectations. And as we said, our expectations for the year remain the same. We're very confident about our ability to deliver on the plan we have laid out for \u201822. Yes, not a whole lot to add. Not much new from our side on that. But I'll let Cheryl make a couple comments there. I'd say generally, yes. In certain of our jurisdictions, we have seen certainly more competition here in the northeast, we continue to believe that we are the preferred provider and should be, we have the scale and the scope necessary to address many of the issues that these municipals face. And we have the expertise that we've demonstrated in a number of transactions throughout our service territory that really proves that, in fact, we are the best provider in all of these situations. So certainly more competition. But we remain very confident in our ability to deliver the needed services for some of these communities that need help. Yes, it's a good question. Obviously, there's still lots of impacts being felt throughout the economy. And we certainly are not immune to that. Although, I would say we're in a better position than most just given our size and scale and our ability to sort of mass purchase products that we need. There are some supply chain bottlenecks, I'd say around certain items that we use, but we've actually seen a bit of an improvement in the supply. And some of those critical items, we've seen price increases, but we've actually seen the rate of those increases start to slow down a bit, which is a positive sign. And again, just given our size and scale, we've certainly been able to manage through that so far. And we'll continue to focus on all things we can do to help mitigate those impacts and ultimately, the impacts to customers. Yes, it's a good question. I would just tell you that our current regulatory schedule, or activity is really according to our plan. We have signaled, I think for some time that you can expect us to be in the regulatory arena regularly. And certainly on our larger stage, every two to three years, we would expect to be in for general rate increases every two to three years. And I think that's reflective, also of just the level of capital spending. As you know, we have increased our spend trajectory in this last plan update we did in November. So that just again, underscores our approach to regulatory recovery, and the cycle on which we will execute that. I think it's also important to note that we have very effective mechanisms in many of our jurisdictions. And I think we're somewhere in the 65% range or so of our spend gets recovered through those mechanisms, which certainly helps on the regulatory lag side, from an earnings perspective, and helps the customer I think, sort of better plan for rate increases coming their way. So we take advantage of all those things and use those as effectively as we can to execute on the strategy. Now, long answer to your question. Short answer is, it is according to the plan, and we've continued to execute according to that plan."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to American Water's Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I'd now like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Dave. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the fourth quarter earnings release and in our 2023 Form 10-K, each filed yesterday with the SEC.. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions.  With that, I'll turn the call over to American Waters' President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2023 with very strong financial results that were right on plan. As shown on slide five, earnings were $4.90 per share for the year, which included $0.13 per share of favorable weather, most of which we discussed earlier in the year. Excluding the estimated weather impact, earnings of $4.77 per share were at the midpoint of the guidance rates we shared originally back in November of 2022. I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably through numerous economic events this past year, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we had for 2023. I'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver, and especially over the past few months during a cold January and active storm season across the country. I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses, and communities. You can see here on slide five an abbreviated list of some of our key accomplishments in 2023, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors is that our strong execution in 2023 amid the challenging macro backdrop coupled with our clear top-tier growth plan demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we will execute our plans in 2024 and beyond with the great momentum we have from 2023. Turning to slide six. As you can see, we have delivered an excellent total shareholder return over the past five and ten years, including our growing record of significant dividend increases. We're proud of this history, which compares very favorably to other utilities. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and utility stocks in general did not perform nearly as well as the S&P 500 in 2023, which dampened the outperformance we've had versus the S&P 500 over the last decade or so. Relative valuations of utility stocks fell without regard to specific performance, all of that while we continued our very strong performance. I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will continue to produce superior shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for years to come, which takes us to slide seven. The comments that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of the financial plan, long-term targets, and guidance we laid out last November, highlighted by 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth. Later, John will recap the drivers for our growth in 2024, including the increase to our EPS guidance range that we announced yesterday. Big picture, though, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth, our low-risk capital plan, our ESG leadership, and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from other utilities in the sector. I'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2028 in our five-year plan and beyond that. This, of course, is driven by significant investments in infrastructure and acquisitions coupled with our track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, all with a keen focus on affordability. And on top of all of that, we continue to grow organically, including in our military services business that successfully serves 18 military installations across the country. One final thought I want to leave you with as we begin 2024. American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work we do across the country. The impact we are making in communities across our 14 states to improve water and wastewater service is critical to the well-being of the citizens we are proud to serve. And as we've told you many times, we are committed to solving local infrastructure issues while at the same time driving efficiencies in our business to remain very affordable to our customers. Policymakers frequently encourage our leadership to keep growing, keep investing, and keep solving problems in their states. And this includes Pennsylvania, where we applaud the Public Utility Commission's proposal on February 1 to enhance the process around the implementation of fair market value legislation. We believe the spirit of the enhancements is to increase public awareness and establish greater procedural consistency, all in support of much-needed consolidation of the common wealth water and wastewater systems. While the business of providing these critical services can at times lead to enhancements in the way we do business, including in the regulatory construct, we have no doubt about the overwhelmingly positive support we receive from stakeholders as we pursue our company's mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about rate-based growth, our regulatory plan, and some recent news around lead service lines. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to slide 9, where these graphs illustrate that our continued successful execution of our capital investment plan is succeeding in growing regulated rate base consistent with our long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate-based growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis. Turning to slide 10, I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states, beginning with our most recently filed cases. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in November and are seeking recovery of $1 billion of investments. The case is proceeding as planned, including testimony and evidentiary hearings that are scheduled for February and March, with rates still expected to be effective in August. As a reminder, Pennsylvania uses a forward test year for rate-making purposes. In New Jersey, we filed a general rate case in January and are seeking recovery of over $1.3 billion of investments through December 2024. This case includes, for example, infrastructure improvement projects at all seven of our surface water treatment plants in the state. We expect the New Jersey case to be completed sometime later this fall. We also filed a general rate case last month in Illinois, where we have invested over $550 million since our last case. Our general rate cases in California, West Virginia, and Virginia are all progressing well and as expected. In California, we reached a partial settlement in the case in November related to the revenue request. We will prepare to implement the new rates retroactively to January 1, 2024, upon receiving the CPUC's decision on the settlement agreement and outstanding topics related to rate design and revenue stabilization mechanisms. Our request for a one-year extension on the cost of capital was also granted, pushing the next filing out to May of 2025. In Indiana, we received a final order just yesterday, and it looks very constructive. We are currently evaluating it and will share key takeaways in the next day or two, but overall, we're generally pleased. Finally, in Kentucky, we expect to receive a final order very soon. As a reminder, we expect to file general rate cases about every two years in our larger jurisdictions. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in obtaining constructive outcomes again in 2024, as we did in 2023. On the legislative front, in New Jersey, new legislation supporting capital investment was passed and was signed by the governor in January. The Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Sharge, or RESIC for short, establishes a new regulatory mechanism that will enable water and wastewater utilities to recover in a more timely manner capital spending related to investments in resiliency, environmental compliance, safety, and public health. This includes capital related to PFAS remediation. In fact, most of our states where PFAS is present, there are either existing environmental mechanisms that we believe PFAS investments will fit under, or we're proactively advocating for such mechanisms. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on slide 11 that we have $390 million in annualized new revenues and rates since January of 2023. This includes $273 million from general rate cases and step increases and $117 million from infrastructure surSharges. We also have $670 million of total annualized revenue requests pending. As a reminder, American Water recovers about 75% of our overall capital spend through infrastructure mechanisms or forward test years, which greatly reduces regulatory lag. Alongside all of the investments we're making, we remain extremely focused on customer affordability and operating efficiently. We are continuing to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We are also continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale, and cost management to deliver on customer affordability, especially as the regulatory demands of the proposed PFAS rule and lead and copper rule improvements drive increases on our capital program. On slide 12, I'd like to cover our recent announcements regarding the US EPA's proposed lead and copper rule improvements. Like PFAS, we think clear rules are important and should be enforced for all providers. American Water consistently meets water quality standards related to the lead and copper rules across our footprint and believes removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. But also like PFAS, we believe all stakeholders must understand the costs associated with the proposed improvements to the lead and copper rule and that the EPA estimates are likely understated. The cost to identify the material of all unknown service lines and replace all lead service lines, including the customer-owned lines and galvanized lines were needed by 2037 will require significant investment for all water systems. We are currently developing preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. Unlike PFAS, though, the expected timeline for complying with the lead and copper rule improvements is much longer, so the impact on capital spend will be more gradual. Providing safe, reliable, and affordable water is American Water's business. We continue to work with the EPA, Congress, regulators, and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protect customers, communities, and the general public. As I close on slide 13, you can see that our five-year capital plan, which is unchanged from November, has $1 billion for PFAS and approximately $500 million for lead service line replacements. We have been proactively investing about $100 million per year to replace lead service lines for several years now and expect to continue that level at least through 2030 or beyond. Depending on the EPA's requirements in the final lead and copper rule improvements, such as for customer-owned service lines, our annual investment level may need to be revised and likely over a longer period of time. Also, we are still awaiting a final rule from the U.S. EPA on PFAS. We continue to expect that there will be no material changes to the proposed rule, and we have not changed any of our announced plans or estimates from last November related to PFAS compliance. We continue to treat for PFAS in compliance with state regulations, and we continue to prepare for full compliance with the new federal rule once released. Previously, we have disclosed that we are a party to the multi-district litigation, or MDL, lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against manufacturers of certain PFAS, like 3M and DuPont, for damages. In early December, there were deadlines to decide whether or not to remain partly to the two potential settlements with manufacturers, and we did remain a party to both settlements. We believe this is the optimal path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in an expedient manner for our customers. On February 8, the MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont settlement. We will now begin the process of perfecting our claims under the settlement within the time period provided by the MDL. A fairness hearing on the 3M settlement was held on February 2. This matter remains pending. In closing, it's important for investors to understand that the ever-changing regulatory environment is leading to significant industry challenges, including those related to lead and PFAS, but also with issues like cyber-security, for example. Each change on its own is significant, but the layering effect of all these changes is even more dramatic. The expertise we bring to the table to solve these challenges is well recognized across the states where we operate and sets us apart from others. It's a privilege and a great responsibility to deliver safe, clean, reliable, and affordable services to our customers and communities. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?\nJohn Griffith: Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 15, let me provide a few more details on financial results for 2023. The appendix also has details of fourth quarter EPS. Consolidated earnings were $4.90 per share in 2023, up $0.39 per share compared to 2022, and up $0.32 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we've made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher in 2023 by an estimated net $0.13 per share as a result of weather in the second, third, and fourth quarters due to warm and dry conditions primarily in Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related mostly to warm and dry conditions in New Jersey. In looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.13 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.11 per share, including inflationary pressures, are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively sought in general rate cases we completed in the last 12 months to 18 months. In the fourth quarter, we also had higher costs of about $0.10 per share related to waste disposal, equipment repairs, tank painting, and other maintenance costs across our footprint. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.24 per share, and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.38 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I have mentioned all year, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance back in early March was offset by avoided interest on the year. An additional benefit realized this year from the equity issuance is the interest income we have been earning from the cash balance held since March. Other reflects primarily post-closing acquisition adjustments in 2022 from the sales of HOS in New York, which added to EPS. Turning to slide 16, you will see we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on '23 acquisitions totaling $77 million across eight states in 2023. We also have 25 transactions under agreement across seven states at year end, totaling $589 million and 88,000 customer connections. This total includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois. We are very close to completing the Granite City acquisition where we already provide wastewater collection service for approximately 12,000 customers. In Pennsylvania, as Susan briefly discussed, the regulatory environment relating to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive, but will take a period of time to sort out. We are very confident that Act 12 fair market value legislation will remain in place and continue to have strong support. As is often the case, implementation of legislation needs to be worked through in the regulatory arena, and that is what is happening now. In the meantime, closing of our current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident that the previously approved Butler acquisition will close soon. We are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania, driven by the continued need for system consolidation and upgrading for the benefit of communities in Pennsylvania who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service. As you know, we have a strong track record of closing acquisitions. Over the past five years, we have closed over 100 acquisitions across 12 states, totaling nearly 200,000 new customer connections. Of course, as we close transactions, the work to build and refill our acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of more than 1.3 million customer connections with meaningful contributions from across our platform continues to be a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate-based growth outlook. As you recall, in November, we introduced our long-term target of 2% annual customer growth from acquisitions, as shown on slide 7. This equates to about 70,000 acquired customers per year, based on our current customer count of approximately 3.5 million customers. We are proactively investing in our capabilities across our platform to bolster our system-wide contribution to acquisitions to support this growth and are confident in meeting our 2% long-term target. Turning to slide 17, here we show the buildup from 2023 weather-normalized actual to the 2024 EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 that we introduced last November, which reflects 8% growth at the midpoint of $5.15. Working from that same buildup, yesterday, we announced an increase of $0.10 per share to our 2024 EPS guidance range, which is now $5.20 to $5.30 per share. The increase is due solely to additional interest income we will receive in 2024 and expect to receive annually through 2026 from the amended terms of the secured seller note from the sale of HOS. As we described in the 8-K we filed on February 5, the note balance has been increased to $795 million from $720 million, which satisfies payment of a contingent consideration owed to American Water of $75 million, triggered by the extension of HOS's service agreement with the New York City Water Board. In addition, reflecting current market interest rates and removal of American Water's option to require prepayment of the note at a future date, the annual interest rate on the note has been increased from 7% to 10%. American Water is pleased to see the continued growth of the HOS business under its new ownership, including the service contract extension with New York City, as well as the significant acquisition recently announced by HOS, which will be funded with new equity from HOS's owners. As it relates to future earnings guidance, it will be important for investors to be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy before this additional interest income. Therefore, when we provide forward year EPS guidance each November, we will be sure to note the EPS associated with the additional interest income from the secured seller note in that guidance. To wrap up, slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition, which we further solidified in 2023. Just last month, Moody's affirmed our solid Baa1 investment grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio. We are confident our FFO to debt ratios will continue to support our current credit ratings. Our total debt to capital ratio as of December 31, net of our roughly $330 million of cash on hand is 55%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. While having moderated somewhat, the current higher interest rate environment continues to be challenging. As I said in November, though, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with this challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances, and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the benefit of our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.\nShar Pourreza: Hey, guys. Good morning. Yes, I don't usually lead off with sort of an M&A question, but I know John loves talking about M&A, and we saw that in the prepared remarks. And obviously, it's timely given the Eversource news yesterday where they essentially put a querying on the block. Can you speak maybe to your appetite for larger inorganic opportunities and specifically any geographic aversions to the Northeast in light of the developments yesterday?\nSusan Hardwick: Thank you. Yes, Shar, I think it's a great question. Obviously, we saw the news as well, and John certainly can comment more. I'd say, first of all, of course, we don't comment on any activity in the M&A space of that nature. I think for us, it continues to be our standards that we've shared. We have to be confident in the ability to grow. We have to have confidence in regulatory environments, confidence in policy, support in any jurisdiction that we're currently in or other jurisdictions we may be looking at. So I think that's always the gate at which we evaluate opportunities. So I'd probably just say that. John, any additional comments from your side?\nJohn Griffith: Well said.\nShar Pourreza: Perfect. And then just a follow-on. I know you're still kind of working through some of the ins and outs lead and copper rule. Is there even a general CapEx upside amount you could give us to think about would the spend sort of be additive in your view to the current plan? Or would it shift out some spend out like we saw with -- obviously, with PFAS spend on the last update.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, Shar, let me again sort of generally answer and then Cheryl can add to it. I think it's -- first of all, it's sort of too early to be able to give any additional guidance around impacts to our overall plan. I think the important thing to remember here is it is over a much longer period of time than what we're seeing with the PFAS rules, for example. So it will give us more time to figure out what the actual impacts are to the plant, give us more opportunity to look at opportunity to move other projects around to sort of accommodate whatever spend we think maybe incremental here for us. So we just probably need a little bit more time to sort through it and then we can give a clearer guidance. Again, as Cheryl said in her prepared remarks, we know it will be significant. I don't think it will have the dramatic impact on our plan for shorter-term windows like we saw with PFAS, for example. Cheryl, anything you want to add to that?\nCheryl Norton: Yes. The only thing I would add, Shar, is just that we have been making really good progress in that space and we'll continue to be focused on removing our lead service lines and the customer lead service line where they exist. But this is a more inclusive rule that, as Susan said, is over a longer period of time, so we'll continue to look at how we can layer that in.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think just to sort of punch line on that one, and Cheryl again made the comment in her prepared remarks, this is about unknown service lines, unknown material, and it is about customer owns. So as we've been working through our own program of replacing our lines, now we have the added requirement to look at unknown pipe and customer service lines. So that's why it gets bigger. And then again, the long-term time horizon to deal with it, I think, is also important to keep note of.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. \nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, good morning, team. Thanks for giving me time. Hey, just\u2026 Morning. Good morning, Susan. Just I hate to go back to the M&A. I know you're kind of going to be very limited in what you can say. But we've been getting a ton of questions on this. So I just want to be clear about something. In your seat, your peers generally describe M&A as a high hurdle rate, right, with the organic growth opportunities that they have as a company. How would you characterize the Connecticut water assets? Are these ones -- one-of-a-kind assets, those large assets that don't often come to markets extremely attractive? Or would you say the M&A opportunity is still a high hurdle rate versus the organic CapEx that you have? And I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I just want to see how you're thinking about it.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Durgesh, I'll tell you at the outset, you're not going to be happy with my answer because I'm not going to sort of go into a whole lot of detail here. I think -- our focus continues to be on the communities and the states that we currently operate in. And as you know, we're in 14 different states. We think there are just a significant number of opportunities in those states, and we're going to continue to focus on that. As you would expect anyone to do, we'll take a look at this kind of an opportunity as everyone would, but I think, again, our screens are the critical thing you should focus on. Regulatory environment, legislative environment, business climate and the ability to grow and that we're always going to look at opportunities from that perspective.\nDurgesh Chopra: Understood. Susan, I appreciate that. Maybe then switching gears. Can you just update us on the Pennsylvania rate case, the commission, I think, came out in December, I think they may have suspended the rate case schedule. Maybe just talk to that, what does that mean? What are the next steps there, please?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Cheryl, I think laid out the details around timing. We've disclosed the size of the case, et cetera. Sort of big picture for me on this case. As is the case really with all of our general rate cases we have in progress, it's all about investment. We're not trying to do anything tricky in any of these cases, no significant policy changes from our perspective. This is simply about investment. That's what this Pennsylvania case is about and we'll continue to work through the process. There are no indications of any issues associated with this case as we work through the process, and we'll continue to to stay on that path. I'd say that's generally the case on all of our jurisdictions, all the cases that we have on file today. We've been signalling this, I think, for quite some time that the expectation to be in for general rate cases on this roughly 2-year cycle. We've been saying that for probably two, three years now, and this is just the continuation of that program. And it's all really driven again by our investment -- the pace of our investment, we've been increasing our capital spend plan for a number of years now to really address the needs that exist in the communities that we serve. And I think our regulatory strategy is consistent with that approach. So Pentyvania is no different than any other state in terms of our approach to it, and we'll continue to work the process there like we always do and we think Pennsylvania again, is a very constructive state, and we're confident in our ability to work through that case.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. Just a quick follow-up there, Susan, -- like do does the procedure like the steps in the rate case in terms of testimony, intervenor testimony and all that stuff. Does that go along as planned with the suspension? Or is that on pause? I might have seen something that maybe on pause. I'm not sure if.\nSusan Hardwick: No, no change. Yes, no change. It's on schedule and on the normal process.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAgnieszka Storozynski: Good morning. I'm going to ask about Illinois first. I mean we have some very bad outcomes, regulatory outcomes on the electric and gas side in the states. You have a case there where we're already seeing some noise around it. So I'm just wondering how -- if there is any lesson learned from what happened in December and if you've incorporated that into the current timing? And then secondly, on PFAS, so we're seeing some lawsuits against investor-owned utilities on the back of PFAS. I understand that you've mentioned that you've been in compliance and going beyond requirements, but I'm just wondering how you manage this risk.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Again, let me sort of start off here. On Illinois, I would take my answer to Pennsylvania and insert the word, Illinois. We are proceeding there as scheduled with no significant issues in that case. It is about investment, and we'll continue to process that case like we always would. Certainly, there is noise around the electric and gas industry cases there. We think, again, our cases are different in that they are about investment only, and we're confident in our ability to continue to work through that case as well. On PFAS, Cheryl, you might just actually want to comment on Illinois, if you like. And then on PFAS. There's obviously a lot going on here, too. I think the litigation environment around this is probably not surprising. There'll be all sorts of plaintiffs' attorneys looking for an angle here. And I think that's probably what mostly you're referring to and what we're seeing. But Cheryl, anything you want to add on either of these topics?\nCheryl Norton: Yes. I would just say, Susan, you were completely accurate on Illinois. We built a really strong case based on capital investment and we feel good about that case and the process. We're just going to go through the process there, the way we normally would. As far as the PFAS stuff, I do believe that there -- we've seen some lawsuits out there, Angie, as you mentioned. But we've been working really hard both to make sure that we're in compliance with all the rules that are out there that we're being proactive in our approach. But we're also working with EPA on the CRC designation and working at the federal level to try to get protections for water utilities all across the U.S. because we believe that we shouldn't be held accountable for polluted waters that are coming to us, and we're doing everything we possibly can to treat for that pollutant. And so we think that we should be protected from that. So we're going to continue to work in that vein and in that space and being part of the MDL, that's one step in that process to get recovery from the people who caused the solution in the first place.\nOperator: Next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Hey, good morning, team. Thank you very much for the time. I appreciate it. And nicely done on the guidance here, I got to say. Maybe actually, to that point on guidance, given the bump here. Just with respect to resetting higher the CAGR going forward, I just want to recognize that this goes through '26. Implicitly, could we say this is a statement of confidence through the forecast period? Or is this more nuance to the specific 3-year forecast period, '25, '24 to '26 here, if you will?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think we've tried to be clear, Julien, on the sort of duration of this additional interest we'll have on the note. But John, do you want to comment on this further?\nJohn Griffith: Yes, I think you've got it right, Julian. It's -- think of this as an increase over our ongoing guidance for that period through '26. And that's -- but we've not made changes as we tried to describe in our comments from our original guidance on the regulated strategy from back in November?\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Right. Yes, understood. I just wanted to clarify that extra clear. With respect to Illinois here, obviously, you've got this case out there, there's a certain degree of attention. Can you comment a little bit about maybe some of the rate mitigation factors, what other pieces could help offset some of the rate increases to customers in Illinois? And any other mitigating factors and circumstances around that case that we can speak to here, for instance.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I'll comment on sort of overall strategy on that point. I think we treat Illinois the same as we do our other states. I mean we've been very focused on mechanisms or approaches to regulatory solutions that will help lessen and mitigate the direct impact of inflationary cost pension and other things, we've done that via trackers, we've done that via deferrals, and we've done that sort of across many of our jurisdictions, and we have a good amount of those costs actually, frankly, already sort of dealt with and embedded in rate structures across our territory. In Illinois, really no different than that. And as Cheryl said, we're just not experiencing other issues currently in that case. Now we obviously have to finish it. We have to get through the rest of the procedural schedule. And work through any issues that may come up. But we're not anticipating anything materially different there.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Yes. Excellent. And then lastly, just going back to the M&A point you were making earlier. I thought you were pretty clear about this. It needs to be accretive and/or provide robust visible growth. I just want to make sure I'm hearing you right about the growth piece there in terms of a key element in ingredient.\nSusan Hardwick: Well, I don't know that I said it has to be accretive. Are you -- I guess you're talking about the M&A piece. I think, again, I'll just repeat it. I think our view is that for us to look at new jurisdictions, it has to be productive, regulatory, legislative business environment. And the opportunity for growth, and I really, I guess, was referring to sort of footprint growth there. And obviously, you would apply a meaningful financial contribution from that too. So it's the same screens we've always had. It's the same dialogue we've always had on potential expansion into other territories. So I don't think this particular situation changes anything about how we feel about growth in other jurisdictions.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Got it. And just going back to lastly on that FMV piece, you guys commented extensible here, but just the time line on getting that clarity there. And you talked about being a little bit more protracted. Just how does this sort of at least from a process perspective, finally get to some resolution as far as you guys are concerned? And then prospects on expanding it even from there, given where we stand.\nSusan Hardwick: Well, Julian, you're going to have to help me. On the first part of your question, I'm not sure what you're referring to.\nJulien Dumoulin-Smith: Well, just on the fair market value just in terms of potentially taking a little bit longer yes, indeed.\nSusan Hardwick: I got you. I just didn't hear the first part. Yes, I think that, as I said in my remarks, and John expanded on a bit, I think that what the PUC has done in Pennsylvania is actually quite helpful. And I've got a lot of experience in the regulatory world over the last 40 years or so. I've seen many pieces of legislation enacted, and I've seen many situations where commissions have to work through the implementation of that legislation. And I think that's exactly what we're doing here. And as we said, we applaud the commission for taking this approach and really being thoughtful about it and understanding the importance of this legislation to the larger strategy in the Commonwealth. So I think the steps that are being taken make good sense. Now having said that, we do have to continue to work through how those guidelines ultimately may be employed. But we think it's just helpful. And we'll give a framework for all of us to be able to work more productively in. Now having said that also, we do have to sort out what it means in terms of timing, and we've got a number of cases, acquisitions that we're working on in Pennsylvania through the regulatory and approval process, and it's obviously impacting that a bit currently, but we expect that to clear soon and be able to get back on our way here.\nOperator: Next question Comes from Anthony Crowdell with Mizuho. Please go ahead.\nAnthony Crowdell: Just a quick housekeeping question after Julien. You talked about the HOS note in the income, and you're very clear about that, that's more -- or not much of an ongoing earnings number. I think you talked about maybe it rolls off in 2026. When we move forward post '26, should we think about additional rate base that maybe backfills that on a more linear growth rate? Or -- and I know $0.10 of a $5 in some number is very small, but just does something backfill that to keep their earnings trajectory pretty linear?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think you hit on it, Anthony, there at the end. It's not terribly material. We think this is a great benefit from a cash flow perspective. The additional interest is nice to have. We think the certainty associated with that contingent payment we had on the New York contract extension is quite helpful now to have that secured. So we think there's just a variety of things about the restructuring that made a lot of sense for us that don't necessarily translate into any material impact to our overall plan. So long answer to your question, we would not expect there to be a need for finding additional capital to sort of fill in that very minor hole that this $0.10 will create.\nAnthony Crowdell: Great. And just if I could squeeze one more. And it's -- it's to Cheryl's comments earlier and unfortunately, it looks like most of the Q&A has been sidetracked by Eversource question. So I'm not asking an Eversource question. Just when Cheryl talked about the increased needs on water systems, cybersecurity, you just think of that, is that maybe a foreshadow to that maybe the smaller bolt-on acquisitions may come at a greater frequency because of the requirements that are being -- the compliance requirements that are being put on these smaller systems, was that where that was headed?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think this is an area we've tried to signal, I think, for the last several discussions we've been having, and I think really probably what prompted that even was PFAS as an example. We see that as just another area that may be difficult for some of these smaller systems to be able to manage, both from an investment standpoint as well as an expertise standpoint. Cyber is another great example. Interest rates is another great example. I mean, the list just gets longer, not shorter for these communities to sort of have to deal with. And from our perspective, we have always been very focused on trying to define what the need is for a community and helping satisfy those needs. And again, from an M&A perspective or an acquisition perspective, as that list gets longer, it creates more opportunity for us to have that dialogue and work with communities to solve those kinds of problems. So yes, we think it does have upside to our acquisition strategy. It\u2019s probably not a Tsunami though to use a water term. It's probably a much sort of longer-term impact I think it takes a bit of time for communities to sort of wrestle with these issues and determine impacts to them before the ready to make a move. So again, we use these kinds of issues in our discussions. I think it will take some time before we see any measurable impact directly related to these issues.\nOperator: The next question comes from Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Hi. Good morning. Good morning, Steve.\nSteven Fleishman: Not an M&A question, so the -- a couple of things on the HOS changes. So -- just the -- thinking about the shift in the interest rate on the note 7%, 10%, which is great; I mean that's a pretty high rate to pay for the seller and I guess, I guess soon to get rid of the prepayment. And so I guess I'm just wondering how do I think about just making sure that, that seller in terms of getting paid back, getting paid.\nSusan Hardwick: Great question, Steve.  Yes. John, do you want to take this question?\nJohn Griffith: Sure. From a credit perspective, we stay very close to the HOS business. We're, in fact, a partner. And as lender, we're constantly in touch with the business. The company has evolved, the credit has improved. Extending the New York contract is a significantly positive credit move and as I mentioned in my comments, the company is currently making an acquisition with new equity funding from their owners as well as cash on their balance sheet. So we do have covenants. They've remained in compliance with the covenants. And in fact, we've taken the opportunity to tighten covenants as well. But when you look at the underlying business, it's frankly doing better than it ever has. So we feel very, very good about the underlying credit here.\nSteven Fleishman: Okay. Does the owner, does the private -- does the firm back it up to? Or is it just the business back up paying the rest?\nJohn Griffith: Yes. No, the owner backs it up, and that's what I was trying to say. So when there's fresh equity coming into the business to make this acquisition, that's coming from APAC who owns the business.\nSteven Fleishman: Got it. And then just -- I know you have that sharing mechanism, too for the business. Could you just maybe let us know kind of how much income you made on the sharing mechanism part in, let's say, 2023 or 20 -- Yes.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Steve, I don't know if we had that disclosed. Is it separate in the 10-K? Yes. Steve, we can point you to it. I'll have Aaron follow back up with you to point you to it. But I think it is in the 10-K, which obviously, we filed last night. And this is the revenue-sharing mechanism you're referring to, where we collect the share of the revenue that's generated from the warranty work that they're doing in our various state jurisdictions where we have contracts. Yes. So Aaron will redirect you to that.\nSteven Fleishman: Last on the Pennsylvania case, I think two of the commissioners sent a letter at the beginning of the case, just kind of framing it. I'm not sure -- is that abnormal would you say? Or is that normal for your Pennsylvania cases? How would you characterize that?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, I would say it's probably not necessarily customary, but again, we think that this case is proceeding as it should. We don't really see, again, any issues here. It's a big case. I mean it's $1 billion worth of investment and we were in just a little under two years ago on this case. So it's certainly material. And again, solely driven by investment in the jurisdictions that we -- or the communities that we serve there.\nOperator: Next question comes from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Reeder: Hey, good morning, team. I just wanted to come back to EA and the fair market value stuff, do you anticipate that all the changes to the fair market value will come via the commission process? Or do you think some of the bills in the legislature will make it across the finish line?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Our view is that this is the best path and the likely path to sort of resolve issues around fair market value in Pennsylvania. Again, I think this is normal practice. And I'm not speaking specific to Pennsylvania. I'm just saying normal in my 40 years of experience, this happens fairly regularly where commissions are charged with interpreting legislation and applying the provisions of it. And that's what I think this commission is doing, and I think they took a very proactive step here to do exactly what you're talking about to resolve the issues and be able to effectively implement the legislation. I think there's no one -- well, I shouldn't say no one. There are a few probably that have conceptual problem with what fair market value legislation was intended to do. I think there's a good understanding of the need for consolidation in the state, and this is the mechanism to allow for that to occur. So I think it stands, and I think the commission will do the work necessary to make sure that the legislation is effectively enacted and implemented.\nJonathan Reeder: Yes. So I mean you're saying PA is, in your opinion, very much fully behind continued promotion of consolidation.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think as a state, as a Commonwealth, I believe that is a true statement, yes.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. what sort of impact do you think it will have on the deal activity? And would you say the proposed RRR will make it tougher for AWK to deliver on the M&A CapEx placeholders?\nSusan Hardwick: I think we'll have to see how it plays out and how ultimately it gets worked from a procedural standpoint. But I'd say, generally speaking, no. we do not see it having a material impact on available opportunities and then ultimately, the outcomes on transactions.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And then last question for me. I saw that in at least the PA and New Jersey rate case filings that revenue decoupling requests were made, possibly, it's in the Illinois case, too. Do you typically make those decoupling requests and just don't get them? Or is that something new that you're pursuing?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, it's a good question. I'd say it varies across jurisdictions. And again, part of our job here is to really understand what each commission is comfortable with and what mechanisms work or don't work in a particular jurisdiction. And it's also part of our responsibility to educate and to inform commissions and their staffs about how various mechanisms can work and what the impacts are. So we do that across our jurisdictions. And I think we have really been more proactive in that regard over the last couple of years. And so I think as we do that education and that dialogue it will inform where we propose what mechanisms. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's a broad application. The decoupling is always on our list. In every jurisdiction, I think it's all circumstantial. What mechanisms work best in what jurisdictions and we work accordingly.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. But for PA in New Jersey, are these new proposals? Or have they been there and, say, your most recent case, too?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I'd have to go back and look to see if we had them specifically in those cases. I don't actually recall. But again, I wouldn't necessarily think this is breaking new ground on either of these proposals.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please go ahead.\nGregg Orrill: Yes. Thank you. Just a question on the PFAS settlements. Just sort of your expectation on the outcome following up on the 3M settlement there. And thanks for the additional updates. I'm just curious if anything's changed around your view of the company's sort of legacy liability to PFAS if there is one?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. On the first question, Greg, around just settlement expected outcomes. Obviously, that process is proceeding. And we had one settlement approved and the other one fairness hearing has occurred, and we would expect it to ultimately get approved. And then the process begins of claim submittals and really going through the settlement allocation process. So obviously, it's too early for us to be able to give you any indication of what we think the outcomes will be financially. But as we've said all along, these will be cents on the dollar in terms of recovery. We don't expect, obviously, for it to cover the full cost of exposure here. But the amounts to be recovered through the settlement, we think is quite important and the best avenue, as Cheryl said in her remarks, to to collect dollars on behalf of the customer to reduce the overall obligation the customer has. So it's a good process. We've been happy to be involved in it. Our team, I think, in a lot of ways, is leading much of the effort around getting this work through the courts and getting outcomes here that are quite favorable. To your second question on how do we view sort of legacy exposure here. I don't think our view changes. As we said earlier, this will be an environment like all where there will be plaintiff's attorneys that are looking for an opportunity here and how that ultimately gets worked through the larger process around the MDL, the multi-district litigation is yet to be seen. But in terms of our exposure, we don't have any different view than we've had from a legacy perspective. Again, as Cheryl said, on a go-forward basis, we are treating and we're preparing to treat, and we're confident in our ability to do that on a go-forward basis.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to slide 9, where these graphs illustrate that our continued successful execution of our capital investment plan is succeeding in growing regulated rate base consistent with our long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate-based growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis. Turning to slide 10, I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states, beginning with our most recently filed cases. In Pennsylvania, we filed a general rate case in November and are seeking recovery of $1 billion of investments. The case is proceeding as planned, including testimony and evidentiary hearings that are scheduled for February and March, with rates still expected to be effective in August. As a reminder, Pennsylvania uses a forward test year for rate-making purposes. In New Jersey, we filed a general rate case in January and are seeking recovery of over $1.3 billion of investments through December 2024. This case includes, for example, infrastructure improvement projects at all seven of our surface water treatment plants in the state. We expect the New Jersey case to be completed sometime later this fall. We also filed a general rate case last month in Illinois, where we have invested over $550 million since our last case. Our general rate cases in California, West Virginia, and Virginia are all progressing well and as expected. In California, we reached a partial settlement in the case in November related to the revenue request. We will prepare to implement the new rates retroactively to January 1, 2024, upon receiving the CPUC's decision on the settlement agreement and outstanding topics related to rate design and revenue stabilization mechanisms. Our request for a one-year extension on the cost of capital was also granted, pushing the next filing out to May of 2025. In Indiana, we received a final order just yesterday, and it looks very constructive. We are currently evaluating it and will share key takeaways in the next day or two, but overall, we're generally pleased. Finally, in Kentucky, we expect to receive a final order very soon. As a reminder, we expect to file general rate cases about every two years in our larger jurisdictions. Because we make prudent investments and have skilled and dedicated employees working on these cases, we're very confident in obtaining constructive outcomes again in 2024, as we did in 2023. On the legislative front, in New Jersey, new legislation supporting capital investment was passed and was signed by the governor in January. The Resiliency and Environmental System Investment Sharge, or RESIC for short, establishes a new regulatory mechanism that will enable water and wastewater utilities to recover in a more timely manner capital spending related to investments in resiliency, environmental compliance, safety, and public health. This includes capital related to PFAS remediation. In fact, most of our states where PFAS is present, there are either existing environmental mechanisms that we believe PFAS investments will fit under, or we're proactively advocating for such mechanisms. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on slide 11 that we have $390 million in annualized new revenues and rates since January of 2023. This includes $273 million from general rate cases and step increases and $117 million from infrastructure surSharges. We also have $670 million of total annualized revenue requests pending. As a reminder, American Water recovers about 75% of our overall capital spend through infrastructure mechanisms or forward test years, which greatly reduces regulatory lag. Alongside all of the investments we're making, we remain extremely focused on customer affordability and operating efficiently. We are continuing to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We are also continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale, and cost management to deliver on customer affordability, especially as the regulatory demands of the proposed PFAS rule and lead and copper rule improvements drive increases on our capital program. On slide 12, I'd like to cover our recent announcements regarding the US EPA's proposed lead and copper rule improvements. Like PFAS, we think clear rules are important and should be enforced for all providers. American Water consistently meets water quality standards related to the lead and copper rules across our footprint and believes removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. But also like PFAS, we believe all stakeholders must understand the costs associated with the proposed improvements to the lead and copper rule and that the EPA estimates are likely understated. The cost to identify the material of all unknown service lines and replace all lead service lines, including the customer-owned lines and galvanized lines were needed by 2037 will require significant investment for all water systems. We are currently developing preliminary estimates based on the proposed rule. Unlike PFAS, though, the expected timeline for complying with the lead and copper rule improvements is much longer, so the impact on capital spend will be more gradual. Providing safe, reliable, and affordable water is American Water's business. We continue to work with the EPA, Congress, regulators, and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protect customers, communities, and the general public. As I close on slide 13, you can see that our five-year capital plan, which is unchanged from November, has $1 billion for PFAS and approximately $500 million for lead service line replacements. We have been proactively investing about $100 million per year to replace lead service lines for several years now and expect to continue that level at least through 2030 or beyond. Depending on the EPA's requirements in the final lead and copper rule improvements, such as for customer-owned service lines, our annual investment level may need to be revised and likely over a longer period of time. Also, we are still awaiting a final rule from the U.S. EPA on PFAS. We continue to expect that there will be no material changes to the proposed rule, and we have not changed any of our announced plans or estimates from last November related to PFAS compliance. We continue to treat for PFAS in compliance with state regulations, and we continue to prepare for full compliance with the new federal rule once released. Previously, we have disclosed that we are a party to the multi-district litigation, or MDL, lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against manufacturers of certain PFAS, like 3M and DuPont, for damages. In early December, there were deadlines to decide whether or not to remain partly to the two potential settlements with manufacturers, and we did remain a party to both settlements. We believe this is the optimal path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in an expedient manner for our customers. On February 8, the MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont settlement. We will now begin the process of perfecting our claims under the settlement within the time period provided by the MDL. A fairness hearing on the 3M settlement was held on February 2. This matter remains pending. In closing, it's important for investors to understand that the ever-changing regulatory environment is leading to significant industry challenges, including those related to lead and PFAS, but also with issues like cyber-security, for example. Each change on its own is significant, but the layering effect of all these changes is even more dramatic. The expertise we bring to the table to solve these challenges is well recognized across the states where we operate and sets us apart from others. It's a privilege and a great responsibility to deliver safe, clean, reliable, and affordable services to our customers and communities. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John? Yes. The only thing I would add, Shar, is just that we have been making really good progress in that space and we'll continue to be focused on removing our lead service lines and the customer lead service line where they exist. But this is a more inclusive rule that, as Susan said, is over a longer period of time, so we'll continue to look at how we can layer that in. Yes. I would just say, Susan, you were completely accurate on Illinois. We built a really strong case based on capital investment and we feel good about that case and the process. We're just going to go through the process there, the way we normally would. As far as the PFAS stuff, I do believe that there -- we've seen some lawsuits out there, Angie, as you mentioned. But we've been working really hard both to make sure that we're in compliance with all the rules that are out there that we're being proactive in our approach. But we're also working with EPA on the CRC designation and working at the federal level to try to get protections for water utilities all across the U.S. because we believe that we shouldn't be held accountable for polluted waters that are coming to us, and we're doing everything we possibly can to treat for that pollutant. And so we think that we should be protected from that. So we're going to continue to work in that vein and in that space and being part of the MDL, that's one step in that process to get recovery from the people who caused the solution in the first place."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we finished 2023 with very strong financial results that were right on plan. As shown on slide five, earnings were $4.90 per share for the year, which included $0.13 per share of favorable weather, most of which we discussed earlier in the year. Excluding the estimated weather impact, earnings of $4.77 per share were at the midpoint of the guidance rates we shared originally back in November of 2022. I'm very proud of our company's ability to stay focused on serving our customers safely and reliably through numerous economic events this past year, which gave us the ability to confidently execute on the plan we had for 2023. I'm also proud of the resilient service we consistently deliver, and especially over the past few months during a cold January and active storm season across the country. I want to thank our employees for safely providing reliable service to the 14 million people we serve in their homes, businesses, and communities. You can see here on slide five an abbreviated list of some of our key accomplishments in 2023, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. Overall, we believe the takeaway today for investors is that our strong execution in 2023 amid the challenging macro backdrop coupled with our clear top-tier growth plan demonstrates American Water's ability to deliver on our long-term plan. I'm very confident we will execute our plans in 2024 and beyond with the great momentum we have from 2023. Turning to slide six. As you can see, we have delivered an excellent total shareholder return over the past five and ten years, including our growing record of significant dividend increases. We're proud of this history, which compares very favorably to other utilities. I want to acknowledge, though, that our stock and utility stocks in general did not perform nearly as well as the S&P 500 in 2023, which dampened the outperformance we've had versus the S&P 500 over the last decade or so. Relative valuations of utility stocks fell without regard to specific performance, all of that while we continued our very strong performance. I'm confident our company's fundamentals and the execution of our strategies will continue to produce superior shareholder value and very competitive total shareholder returns for years to come, which takes us to slide seven. The comments that we'll share today are largely an affirmation of the financial plan, long-term targets, and guidance we laid out last November, highlighted by 7% to 9% EPS and dividend growth. Later, John will recap the drivers for our growth in 2024, including the increase to our EPS guidance range that we announced yesterday. Big picture, though, we believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth, our low-risk capital plan, our ESG leadership, and the affordability of our service continues to be rewarded by investors and distinguishes us from other utilities in the sector. I'll remind you that we believe the runway for our growth and for achieving these targets is very long, certainly through 2028 in our five-year plan and beyond that. This, of course, is driven by significant investments in infrastructure and acquisitions coupled with our track record of constructive regulatory outcomes, all with a keen focus on affordability. And on top of all of that, we continue to grow organically, including in our military services business that successfully serves 18 military installations across the country. One final thought I want to leave you with as we begin 2024. American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work we do across the country. The impact we are making in communities across our 14 states to improve water and wastewater service is critical to the well-being of the citizens we are proud to serve. And as we've told you many times, we are committed to solving local infrastructure issues while at the same time driving efficiencies in our business to remain very affordable to our customers. Policymakers frequently encourage our leadership to keep growing, keep investing, and keep solving problems in their states. And this includes Pennsylvania, where we applaud the Public Utility Commission's proposal on February 1 to enhance the process around the implementation of fair market value legislation. We believe the spirit of the enhancements is to increase public awareness and establish greater procedural consistency, all in support of much-needed consolidation of the common wealth water and wastewater systems. While the business of providing these critical services can at times lead to enhancements in the way we do business, including in the regulatory construct, we have no doubt about the overwhelmingly positive support we receive from stakeholders as we pursue our company's mission. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about rate-based growth, our regulatory plan, and some recent news around lead service lines. Cheryl? Thank you. Yes, Shar, I think it's a great question. Obviously, we saw the news as well, and John certainly can comment more. I'd say, first of all, of course, we don't comment on any activity in the M&A space of that nature. I think for us, it continues to be our standards that we've shared. We have to be confident in the ability to grow. We have to have confidence in regulatory environments, confidence in policy, support in any jurisdiction that we're currently in or other jurisdictions we may be looking at. So I think that's always the gate at which we evaluate opportunities. So I'd probably just say that. John, any additional comments from your side? Yes, Shar, let me again sort of generally answer and then Cheryl can add to it. I think it's -- first of all, it's sort of too early to be able to give any additional guidance around impacts to our overall plan. I think the important thing to remember here is it is over a much longer period of time than what we're seeing with the PFAS rules, for example. So it will give us more time to figure out what the actual impacts are to the plant, give us more opportunity to look at opportunity to move other projects around to sort of accommodate whatever spend we think maybe incremental here for us. So we just probably need a little bit more time to sort through it and then we can give a clearer guidance. Again, as Cheryl said in her prepared remarks, we know it will be significant. I don't think it will have the dramatic impact on our plan for shorter-term windows like we saw with PFAS, for example. Cheryl, anything you want to add to that? Yes. I think just to sort of punch line on that one, and Cheryl again made the comment in her prepared remarks, this is about unknown service lines, unknown material, and it is about customer owns. So as we've been working through our own program of replacing our lines, now we have the added requirement to look at unknown pipe and customer service lines. So that's why it gets bigger. And then again, the long-term time horizon to deal with it, I think, is also important to keep note of. Yes. Durgesh, I'll tell you at the outset, you're not going to be happy with my answer because I'm not going to sort of go into a whole lot of detail here. I think -- our focus continues to be on the communities and the states that we currently operate in. And as you know, we're in 14 different states. We think there are just a significant number of opportunities in those states, and we're going to continue to focus on that. As you would expect anyone to do, we'll take a look at this kind of an opportunity as everyone would, but I think, again, our screens are the critical thing you should focus on. Regulatory environment, legislative environment, business climate and the ability to grow and that we're always going to look at opportunities from that perspective. Yes. Cheryl, I think laid out the details around timing. We've disclosed the size of the case, et cetera. Sort of big picture for me on this case. As is the case really with all of our general rate cases we have in progress, it's all about investment. We're not trying to do anything tricky in any of these cases, no significant policy changes from our perspective. This is simply about investment. That's what this Pennsylvania case is about and we'll continue to work through the process. There are no indications of any issues associated with this case as we work through the process, and we'll continue to to stay on that path. I'd say that's generally the case on all of our jurisdictions, all the cases that we have on file today. We've been signalling this, I think, for quite some time that the expectation to be in for general rate cases on this roughly 2-year cycle. We've been saying that for probably two, three years now, and this is just the continuation of that program. And it's all really driven again by our investment -- the pace of our investment, we've been increasing our capital spend plan for a number of years now to really address the needs that exist in the communities that we serve. And I think our regulatory strategy is consistent with that approach. So Pentyvania is no different than any other state in terms of our approach to it, and we'll continue to work the process there like we always do and we think Pennsylvania again, is a very constructive state, and we're confident in our ability to work through that case. No, no change. Yes, no change. It's on schedule and on the normal process. Yes. Again, let me sort of start off here. On Illinois, I would take my answer to Pennsylvania and insert the word, Illinois. We are proceeding there as scheduled with no significant issues in that case. It is about investment, and we'll continue to process that case like we always would. Certainly, there is noise around the electric and gas industry cases there. We think, again, our cases are different in that they are about investment only, and we're confident in our ability to continue to work through that case as well. On PFAS, Cheryl, you might just actually want to comment on Illinois, if you like. And then on PFAS. There's obviously a lot going on here, too. I think the litigation environment around this is probably not surprising. There'll be all sorts of plaintiffs' attorneys looking for an angle here. And I think that's probably what mostly you're referring to and what we're seeing. But Cheryl, anything you want to add on either of these topics? Yes. I think we've tried to be clear, Julien, on the sort of duration of this additional interest we'll have on the note. But John, do you want to comment on this further? Yes. I'll comment on sort of overall strategy on that point. I think we treat Illinois the same as we do our other states. I mean we've been very focused on mechanisms or approaches to regulatory solutions that will help lessen and mitigate the direct impact of inflationary cost pension and other things, we've done that via trackers, we've done that via deferrals, and we've done that sort of across many of our jurisdictions, and we have a good amount of those costs actually, frankly, already sort of dealt with and embedded in rate structures across our territory. In Illinois, really no different than that. And as Cheryl said, we're just not experiencing other issues currently in that case. Now we obviously have to finish it. We have to get through the rest of the procedural schedule. And work through any issues that may come up. But we're not anticipating anything materially different there. Well, I don't know that I said it has to be accretive. Are you -- I guess you're talking about the M&A piece. I think, again, I'll just repeat it. I think our view is that for us to look at new jurisdictions, it has to be productive, regulatory, legislative business environment. And the opportunity for growth, and I really, I guess, was referring to sort of footprint growth there. And obviously, you would apply a meaningful financial contribution from that too. So it's the same screens we've always had. It's the same dialogue we've always had on potential expansion into other territories. So I don't think this particular situation changes anything about how we feel about growth in other jurisdictions. Well, Julian, you're going to have to help me. On the first part of your question, I'm not sure what you're referring to. I got you. I just didn't hear the first part. Yes, I think that, as I said in my remarks, and John expanded on a bit, I think that what the PUC has done in Pennsylvania is actually quite helpful. And I've got a lot of experience in the regulatory world over the last 40 years or so. I've seen many pieces of legislation enacted, and I've seen many situations where commissions have to work through the implementation of that legislation. And I think that's exactly what we're doing here. And as we said, we applaud the commission for taking this approach and really being thoughtful about it and understanding the importance of this legislation to the larger strategy in the Commonwealth. So I think the steps that are being taken make good sense. Now having said that, we do have to continue to work through how those guidelines ultimately may be employed. But we think it's just helpful. And we'll give a framework for all of us to be able to work more productively in. Now having said that also, we do have to sort out what it means in terms of timing, and we've got a number of cases, acquisitions that we're working on in Pennsylvania through the regulatory and approval process, and it's obviously impacting that a bit currently, but we expect that to clear soon and be able to get back on our way here. Yes. I think you hit on it, Anthony, there at the end. It's not terribly material. We think this is a great benefit from a cash flow perspective. The additional interest is nice to have. We think the certainty associated with that contingent payment we had on the New York contract extension is quite helpful now to have that secured. So we think there's just a variety of things about the restructuring that made a lot of sense for us that don't necessarily translate into any material impact to our overall plan. So long answer to your question, we would not expect there to be a need for finding additional capital to sort of fill in that very minor hole that this $0.10 will create. Yes. I think this is an area we've tried to signal, I think, for the last several discussions we've been having, and I think really probably what prompted that even was PFAS as an example. We see that as just another area that may be difficult for some of these smaller systems to be able to manage, both from an investment standpoint as well as an expertise standpoint. Cyber is another great example. Interest rates is another great example. I mean, the list just gets longer, not shorter for these communities to sort of have to deal with. And from our perspective, we have always been very focused on trying to define what the need is for a community and helping satisfy those needs. And again, from an M&A perspective or an acquisition perspective, as that list gets longer, it creates more opportunity for us to have that dialogue and work with communities to solve those kinds of problems. So yes, we think it does have upside to our acquisition strategy. It's probably not a Tsunami though to use a water term. It's probably a much sort of longer-term impact I think it takes a bit of time for communities to sort of wrestle with these issues and determine impacts to them before the ready to make a move. So again, we use these kinds of issues in our discussions. I think it will take some time before we see any measurable impact directly related to these issues. Great question, Steve.  Yes. John, do you want to take this question? Yes. Steve, I don't know if we had that disclosed. Is it separate in the 10-K? Yes. Steve, we can point you to it. I'll have Aaron follow back up with you to point you to it. But I think it is in the 10-K, which obviously, we filed last night. And this is the revenue-sharing mechanism you're referring to, where we collect the share of the revenue that's generated from the warranty work that they're doing in our various state jurisdictions where we have contracts. Yes. So Aaron will redirect you to that. Yes, I would say it's probably not necessarily customary, but again, we think that this case is proceeding as it should. We don't really see, again, any issues here. It's a big case. I mean it's $1 billion worth of investment and we were in just a little under two years ago on this case. So it's certainly material. And again, solely driven by investment in the jurisdictions that we -- or the communities that we serve there. Yes. Our view is that this is the best path and the likely path to sort of resolve issues around fair market value in Pennsylvania. Again, I think this is normal practice. And I'm not speaking specific to Pennsylvania. I'm just saying normal in my 40 years of experience, this happens fairly regularly where commissions are charged with interpreting legislation and applying the provisions of it. And that's what I think this commission is doing, and I think they took a very proactive step here to do exactly what you're talking about to resolve the issues and be able to effectively implement the legislation. I think there's no one -- well, I shouldn't say no one. There are a few probably that have conceptual problem with what fair market value legislation was intended to do. I think there's a good understanding of the need for consolidation in the state, and this is the mechanism to allow for that to occur. So I think it stands, and I think the commission will do the work necessary to make sure that the legislation is effectively enacted and implemented. Yes. I think as a state, as a Commonwealth, I believe that is a true statement, yes. I think we'll have to see how it plays out and how ultimately it gets worked from a procedural standpoint. But I'd say, generally speaking, no. we do not see it having a material impact on available opportunities and then ultimately, the outcomes on transactions. Yes, it's a good question. I'd say it varies across jurisdictions. And again, part of our job here is to really understand what each commission is comfortable with and what mechanisms work or don't work in a particular jurisdiction. And it's also part of our responsibility to educate and to inform commissions and their staffs about how various mechanisms can work and what the impacts are. So we do that across our jurisdictions. And I think we have really been more proactive in that regard over the last couple of years. And so I think as we do that education and that dialogue it will inform where we propose what mechanisms. So I wouldn't necessarily say it's a broad application. The decoupling is always on our list. In every jurisdiction, I think it's all circumstantial. What mechanisms work best in what jurisdictions and we work accordingly. Yes. I'd have to go back and look to see if we had them specifically in those cases. I don't actually recall. But again, I wouldn't necessarily think this is breaking new ground on either of these proposals. Yes. On the first question, Greg, around just settlement expected outcomes. Obviously, that process is proceeding. And we had one settlement approved and the other one fairness hearing has occurred, and we would expect it to ultimately get approved. And then the process begins of claim submittals and really going through the settlement allocation process. So obviously, it's too early for us to be able to give you any indication of what we think the outcomes will be financially. But as we've said all along, these will be cents on the dollar in terms of recovery. We don't expect, obviously, for it to cover the full cost of exposure here. But the amounts to be recovered through the settlement, we think is quite important and the best avenue, as Cheryl said in her remarks, to to collect dollars on behalf of the customer to reduce the overall obligation the customer has. So it's a good process. We've been happy to be involved in it. Our team, I think, in a lot of ways, is leading much of the effort around getting this work through the courts and getting outcomes here that are quite favorable. To your second question on how do we view sort of legacy exposure here. I don't think our view changes. As we said earlier, this will be an environment like all where there will be plaintiff's attorneys that are looking for an opportunity here and how that ultimately gets worked through the larger process around the MDL, the multi-district litigation is yet to be seen. But in terms of our exposure, we don't have any different view than we've had from a legacy perspective. Again, as Cheryl said, on a go-forward basis, we are treating and we're preparing to treat, and we're confident in our ability to do that on a go-forward basis."

            "content": "Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 15, let me provide a few more details on financial results for 2023. The appendix also has details of fourth quarter EPS. Consolidated earnings were $4.90 per share in 2023, up $0.39 per share compared to 2022, and up $0.32 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we've made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher in 2023 by an estimated net $0.13 per share as a result of weather in the second, third, and fourth quarters due to warm and dry conditions primarily in Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related mostly to warm and dry conditions in New Jersey. In looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.13 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.11 per share, including inflationary pressures, are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively sought in general rate cases we completed in the last 12 months to 18 months. In the fourth quarter, we also had higher costs of about $0.10 per share related to waste disposal, equipment repairs, tank painting, and other maintenance costs across our footprint. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.24 per share, and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.38 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I have mentioned all year, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance back in early March was offset by avoided interest on the year. An additional benefit realized this year from the equity issuance is the interest income we have been earning from the cash balance held since March. Other reflects primarily post-closing acquisition adjustments in 2022 from the sales of HOS in New York, which added to EPS. Turning to slide 16, you will see we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on '23 acquisitions totaling $77 million across eight states in 2023. We also have 25 transactions under agreement across seven states at year end, totaling $589 million and 88,000 customer connections. This total includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois. We are very close to completing the Granite City acquisition where we already provide wastewater collection service for approximately 12,000 customers. In Pennsylvania, as Susan briefly discussed, the regulatory environment relating to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive, but will take a period of time to sort out. We are very confident that Act 12 fair market value legislation will remain in place and continue to have strong support. As is often the case, implementation of legislation needs to be worked through in the regulatory arena, and that is what is happening now. In the meantime, closing of our current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident that the previously approved Butler acquisition will close soon. We are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania, driven by the continued need for system consolidation and upgrading for the benefit of communities in Pennsylvania who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service. As you know, we have a strong track record of closing acquisitions. Over the past five years, we have closed over 100 acquisitions across 12 states, totaling nearly 200,000 new customer connections. Of course, as we close transactions, the work to build and refill our acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of more than 1.3 million customer connections with meaningful contributions from across our platform continues to be a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate-based growth outlook. As you recall, in November, we introduced our long-term target of 2% annual customer growth from acquisitions, as shown on slide 7. This equates to about 70,000 acquired customers per year, based on our current customer count of approximately 3.5 million customers. We are proactively investing in our capabilities across our platform to bolster our system-wide contribution to acquisitions to support this growth and are confident in meeting our 2% long-term target. Turning to slide 17, here we show the buildup from 2023 weather-normalized actual to the 2024 EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 that we introduced last November, which reflects 8% growth at the midpoint of $5.15. Working from that same buildup, yesterday, we announced an increase of $0.10 per share to our 2024 EPS guidance range, which is now $5.20 to $5.30 per share. The increase is due solely to additional interest income we will receive in 2024 and expect to receive annually through 2026 from the amended terms of the secured seller note from the sale of HOS. As we described in the 8-K we filed on February 5, the note balance has been increased to $795 million from $720 million, which satisfies payment of a contingent consideration owed to American Water of $75 million, triggered by the extension of HOS's service agreement with the New York City Water Board. In addition, reflecting current market interest rates and removal of American Water's option to require prepayment of the note at a future date, the annual interest rate on the note has been increased from 7% to 10%. American Water is pleased to see the continued growth of the HOS business under its new ownership, including the service contract extension with New York City, as well as the significant acquisition recently announced by HOS, which will be funded with new equity from HOS's owners. As it relates to future earnings guidance, it will be important for investors to be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy before this additional interest income. Therefore, when we provide forward year EPS guidance each November, we will be sure to note the EPS associated with the additional interest income from the secured seller note in that guidance. To wrap up, slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition, which we further solidified in 2023. Just last month, Moody's affirmed our solid Baa1 investment grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio. We are confident our FFO to debt ratios will continue to support our current credit ratings. Our total debt to capital ratio as of December 31, net of our roughly $330 million of cash on hand is 55%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. While having moderated somewhat, the current higher interest rate environment continues to be challenging. As I said in November, though, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with this challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances, and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the benefit of our customers and shareholders. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have. Well said. Yes, I think you've got it right, Julian. It's -- think of this as an increase over our ongoing guidance for that period through '26. And that's -- but we've not made changes as we tried to describe in our comments from our original guidance on the regulated strategy from back in November? Sure. From a credit perspective, we stay very close to the HOS business. We're, in fact, a partner. And as lender, we're constantly in touch with the business. The company has evolved, the credit has improved. Extending the New York contract is a significantly positive credit move and as I mentioned in my comments, the company is currently making an acquisition with new equity funding from their owners as well as cash on their balance sheet. So we do have covenants. They've remained in compliance with the covenants. And in fact, we've taken the opportunity to tighten covenants as well. But when you look at the underlying business, it's frankly doing better than it ever has. So we feel very, very good about the underlying credit here. Yes. No, the owner backs it up, and that's what I was trying to say. So when there's fresh equity coming into the business to make this acquisition, that's coming from APAC who owns the business."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast within an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I'd now like to introduce you to your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Chris. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the third quarter earnings release and in our September 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will share highlights of third quarter and year-to-date results and will comment on our 2024 EPS guidance and longer-term targets. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our new capital investment plan, including the expected impact of PFAS-related investments, and will conclude with a regulatory update, including our views on customer affordability. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will then discuss our year-to-date financial results in more detail, discuss our acquisition outlook, and will close with details behind our 2024 outlook and longer-term goals and our 2024 to 2028 financing plan. After a few final remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Waters' President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide five, and I'll start by covering some highlights from the third quarter and year-to-date periods. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2023, and we're pleased to again reaffirm our 2023 guidance on a weather-normalized basis. Earnings were $1.66 per share for the quarter compared to $1.63 for the same period last year. In the first nine months of 2023, earnings were $4.03 per share compared to $3.70 per share in the same period of '22. The estimated net favorable weather impact year-to-date in '23 is about $0.11 per share compared to $0.06 per share favorable in '22. These weather-normalized results so far in 2023 continue to reflect our strong execution in line with our growth expectations for the year. John will elaborate further on results later. Moving on to some of our other key accomplishments to date in 2023, we have invested $1.8 billion in capital projects year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. As you will recall, the total capital investment planned for 2023 includes approximately $400 million of acquisitions, including one sizable transaction in Pennsylvania we expect to close in December and another in Illinois around the end of the year. As you know, we completed an equity issuance of $1.7 billion in March and a $1 billion convertible debt issuance in June. These were the two key priorities of our 2023 financing plan. We were focused on completing these issuances in the first half of the year to reduce market-related pricing risk and overall execution risk, which has served our investors, customers -- and our customers well, considering the current market conditions. Turning to Slide six, as we roll out our new five-year plan today, we are affirming our long-term targets, including 7% to 9% EPS and dividend compounded annual growth rates. We are also initiating our 2024 earnings guidance of $5.10 per share to $5.20 per share, which John will discuss further later in the discussion. This represents our expectation of 8% EPS growth in 2024 compared to our weather normalized 2023 EPS guidance. One thing to note on this slide is that we have revised the look of our earnings growth outlook. Recall that we'd historically referred to it as our growth triangle. We believe this new version better highlights our compelling 7% to 9% earnings growth expectation and better represents the key drivers of growth. As a nearly 100% regulated water and wastewater utility, rate-based growth and regulatory execution are the key drivers of growth for our company. Rate-based growth continues to be driven by the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth two years ago and now with this updated plan. Combined with our robust regulated acquisition strategy on which we've proven we can execute, we continue to expect 8% to 9% rate-based growth over the next decade. Later, Cheryl will review the amount of capital we expect to spend over the next five years, including related to acquisitions. On this slide, you can see we are highlighting our acquisition growth strategy measured by a compounded annual growth rate in customer connections of 2%. The timing of closing on acquisitions is often difficult to control within a calendar year, which can cause volatility in acquisition investment on a year-to-year basis. This 2% customer additions CAGR target should be an easier way for investors to monitor and measure our growth through acquisitions. And as I said, rate-based growth, which includes acquisition investment is the key driver to earnings growth. Our growth outlook also includes the organic revenue growth opportunities we expect from our military services group from the 18 installations we currently serve with an added upside for any new bases secured. One of our company's competitive advantages is its diverse regulated operations across 14 states that provides us with flexibility in the timing of rate cases and capital deployment. We also have a very predictable and controllable set of capital projects annually, almost half of which are recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms. Along with our other regulatory approaches, we are confident we can deliver consistent earnings growth and dividend growth over the next five years and beyond. While utility stocks, including ours, have seen the impact on the short term of higher interest rates, history has shown that over medium and longer term horizons, the utility sector and certainly American Water has delivered compelling value to investors. We believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth supported by our significant yet low risk capital investment plan and our focus on customer affordability and ESG leadership will continue to be rewarded by investors. Based on this long-term plan and our history of executing on our strategies, we intend to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come. With that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment plan and our focus on customer affordability and regulatory execution. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into a discussion of our current long-term capital plan, starting on Slide eight, I want to first acknowledge that our teams have done a great job executing on our accelerated capital investment plans these last few years. We have consistently met our capital deployment goal and we're on pace to do it again by meeting our overall capital plan of $2.9 billion this year, which includes acquisition investments. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect a modest increase in our investment spending level to roughly $3.1 billion. Over the next five years, we expect to invest approximately $16 billion to $17 billion, an increase of about $2 billion over our previous plan. We expect constructive outcomes for this important water quality initiative, and we will continue to advocate that the ultimate responsibility for the clean-up of these contaminants should fall to the polluters. We will also continue to advocate that all water and wastewater utility providers, regardless of ownership, have equal access to any federal and or state funding related to treating PFAS. In addition, we'll continue our efforts to request permanent federal funding for a water and wastewater low-income customer assistance program. The other two drivers of increased CapEx in the 2024 to 2028 plan are a higher level of spend related to prioritized renewal projects across our footprint, such as for hydrant, pipe and meter replacement, as well as a higher level of expected follow-on capital related to future acquisitions. Following recent acquisitions, we have continued to experience a higher level of investment need in order to bring water and wastewater systems into regulatory compliance and up to our operating standards, which is driving the higher estimated capital need of $600 million. You can also see that we have deferred $500 million of lower risk projects to later years beyond the five-year plan. We did this as a part of our extensive risk-based project analysis in conjunction with our ongoing affordability analysis. For example, we deferred until later in the 10-year capital plan the replacement of some services in Maine where it was determined that they did not pose an immediate risk to service reliability or water quality. Let's turn to Slide 10 and I'll cover the latest regulatory activity across our states. Shown in the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states. Our general rate cases in California, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky, are all progressing well and as expected. All of these cases, except perhaps California, will most likely be resolved in early 2024. Just yesterday, we filed a general rate case in Virginia reflecting $110 million in system investments covering May 2023 through April 2025. We're seeking $20 million of additional annual revenue and expect interim rates to go into effect in May of next year. Outside of our general rate cases, as we discussed last quarter, we filed a request as authorized by California's water cost of capital mechanism seeking a 52 basis point increase to our ROE in 2023, which was approved on July 25, or increasing the return on equity to 9.5%, effective July 31. We filed a similar request in October for an additional 70 basis point increase to go into effect January 01, 2024, which would bring our ROE to 10.2%. And finally, related to the customers we have proudly served in the Monterey community for over 100 years, in October, a local entity adopted a resolution enabling it to file an eminent domain lawsuit with respect to the Monterey system assets. This is not a new issue, just the latest chapter in a long-running effort by an entity that we believe lacks the expertise to own and operate a very complex water distribution system serving these Monterey customers. Bottom line, we believe based upon existing legal precedent, we'll be able to successfully defend against an eminent domain lawsuit if it's filed. You can find more information on this topic in our SEC filings, including this quarter's 10-Q. Moving to Slide 11, I'll wrap up with a discussion of customer affordability and this new capital investment plan. Using U.S. Census Bureau data specific to the geographies we serve, our research and analysis concluded that projected rising levels of median household income combined with conservative assumptions around an increasing customer base would allow us to stay within our target for residential water bills of 1% or less of median household income. One of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Thankfully, today, our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. At the same time, we realize we must continue to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We must also continue our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale, and cost management in order to deliver on customer affordability. Our dual focus on operating efficiency and customer affordability has been a valuable part of our company's DNA for many years. As you know, we've historically used O&M efficiency as one of our benchmark metrics to measure our success at managing costs as we grow the business. In recent years, we've emphasized that revenue growth has been just as impactful to the O&M efficiency metric as managing costs. As we look ahead, we're continuing to evaluate whether this is the best metric by which to judge our effectiveness at managing costs and running an efficient business. More to come on this in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?\nJohn Griffith: Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 13, let me provide a few more details on year-to-date results. The appendix also has details of third quarter EPS, which has many of the same drivers as year-to-date results. Consolidated earnings were $4.03 per share year-to-date, up $0.33 per share compared to the same period in 2022, and up $0.28 per share on a weather normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we have made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher year-to-date by an estimated net $0.11 per share as a result of weather in the second and third quarters due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related mostly to warm and dry conditions in New Jersey. In looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.10 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.09 per share, including inflationary pressures, are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively sought through the use of forward test years and traditional updates to base cost of service and general rate cases we completed in the last 12 months to 18 months. This strategy has limited the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023 and is a strategy we are continuing to use in our recently filed and upcoming cases. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.17 per share, and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.28 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I mentioned last quarter, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance offsets the avoided interest expense in the current interest rate environment. We expect the impact to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well, based on the current outlook. Turning to Slide 14, this graph illustrates that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions, are succeeding in growing regulated rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate-based growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis. Turning to Slide 15, you'll see that we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on 14 acquisitions, totalling $36 million across six states in the first nine months of 2023, which demonstrates our continued ability to close deals in many states. We also had 32 transactions under agreement across 10 states through the end of September, totalling $611 million, two of which we closed in early October, including one in West Virginia for $27 million. This total also includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois we previously announced. We expect the Butler acquisition to close later this year in Granite City around year end, pending regulatory approvals for each, and we look forward to serving those customers. Also included in our acquisitions under agreement is the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania we expect to purchase for $104 million, as announced back in March. We expect to close this acquisition in late 2024 or early 2025, pending final regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving those customers as well. Our outlook for future acquisitions remains very strong, as we expect to have over $250 million of acquisitions under agreement at the end of 2023 after the expected closings of Butler and Granite City. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate-based growth outlook. On Slide 16, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2024 results in our newly established EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by capital investment to serve our customers and earning a return on that investment. As we've talked about previously, 2023 is year two of our accelerated CapEx plan following the HOS sale. So we see that ramp up reflected in earnings in 2024, both from base rate increases and infrastructure mechanisms. As a reminder, approximately 45% of our CapEx is recoverable by infrastructure mechanisms, so it's a very meaningful driver of consistent earnings growth for us. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year. I'd like to note that our military services group does add incrementally to our earnings growth expectation, as we have continued to show in our growth outlook. MSG's great work on the 18 military installations it serves has built trust and resulted in the U.S. government allocating additional funds for improvement projects, driving increased revenues. Just as critical to our growth strategy is our ability to prudently manage the operating costs it takes to run the business, which goes to my final point on this slide. Because of our strong culture of operating efficiency and cost management, we expect only modest increases in O&M in 2024. These efforts go to the heart of the customer affordability construct we want to protect, which is closely aligned with the interests of regulators and ultimately investors in managing affordability of customer bills. Finally, related to pension, I'd simply remind you that our pension obligation remeasurement will be done at yearend 2023, and that will drive the determination of our 2024 pension expense. Turning to Slide 17, I'll provide a financing plan update before closing with a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile. In our prior five-year plan through 2027, we expected a total of $2 billion of equity financing need. We successfully issued $1.7 billion of the $2 billion earlier this year, leaving $300 million of equity financing needed toward the end of that prior plan. Based on our new capital plan, our financing plan now includes an estimated $1 billion of equity issuances from 2024 through 2028. The $1 billion of equity in our new plan is expected to be issued near the middle of the 2024 to 2028 period, subject to market conditions. The $700 million increase in the anticipated external equity need is driven by the incremental $2 billion of CapEx in the new plan. As we've said many times now, we expect incremental CapEx to be funded roughly 50-50 debt and equity, which includes both external equity and cash flow from operations. Our financing plan design also takes into account the goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet and continuing to meet our long-term debt-to-capital target of less than 60%. Another assumption inherent in our new plan is that we will continue to be a cash taxpayer, especially as we will likely become subject to the new corporate alternative minimum tax in the coming years. On Slide 18, we provide a summary of our continued strong financial condition. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, net of roughly $630 million of cash on hand remains at 54%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. As we are all aware, the current higher interest rate environment is challenging. We are, however, in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with the challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances. We remain confident that we will have strong access to capital for the long term. In fact, we just extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to October 2028, which has a capacity of $2.75 billion. Our diversified banking relationships with some of the largest and strongest banks in the world, coupled with our fully regulated business model and strong credit ratings, gives us great confidence around liquidity. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is very important in environments like the current one to manage cash flows and minimize interest rate risk, which contributes to managing customer affordability. And our short duration between general rate cases allows us to minimize any lag we may experience related to recovery of debt costs. With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan for some closing thoughts. Susan?\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, John. To close on Slide 20, you've heard our latest strategic thinking today, and it should sound very familiar. It's all about execution at every level. As we continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently execute, we believe our industry leading EPS and dividend growth, combined with our focus on affordability and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and strategy separate us from all utilities. They are underpinned by our significant low-risk capital investment plan, which includes our best-in-class execution on acquisitions and our excellent regulatory execution, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with a well-planned debt maturity profile and a differentiated affordability proposition. Through our consistent achievement of high operating standards, including our leading safety culture and water quality accolades, our team at American Water has raised the bar for success in the water and wastewater industry and that includes the outstanding efforts by our Military Services Group team to proudly serve the 18 military installations in our footprint. Our history of executing on our strategies has delivered a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return. With this long-term plan, we have full confidence in our ability to achieve the goals we talked about today and continue our track record of delivering superior shareholder value. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chris to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Today's first question comes from Richard Sunderland with JP Morgan. Please proceed.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Am I coming through clearly?\nSusan Hardwick: You are, Rich. Good morning.\nRichard Sunderland: Great, thank you. Appreciate the details around the update here. I wanted to start with the CapEx revision and the bill outlook. Looking back to 2021, when you first outlined the Accelerated Investment Plan, you gave some details on the customer affordability angle, but I'm curious, kind of bridging, not back to last year, but back to '21, is there anything different in that outlook now? Obviously, CapEx is up significantly. Also curious if the 2% customer additions target in the language around there for M&A has factored into how you've crafted this new capital plan around the customer affordability angle as well.\nSusan Hardwick: Okay, Rich, yeah, there's a lot in there. Let me start and then Cheryl and John can add to it. I would say our focus has sharpened over the last number of years related to customer affordability. And that sharpened focus, I think, has really been around this sort of wallet share concept that Cheryl talked about. I think it's important for us to understand the communities that we operate in and the demographics of those communities and what are the challenges of customers in those communities and we've been able to do a lot of analysis at a very detailed level around affordability, around household income, around just economic impacts in the various communities that we serve and our focus has been, I think, very clearly defined around our wallet share as a percentage of that household income and we've been developing this concept here now for a number of years and I think that our ability to confidently say this plan as we've continued to grow it, we'll continue to maintain our position of roughly 1% or less of a customer's bill in the communities that we serve specifically and I think that focus has allowed us to really think about how to build this plan, how to continue to grow it, how to continue to grow rate base while not overburdening customers with our growth expectations. I think this plan fits very nicely in that concept. Cheryl, you want to add anything?\nCheryl Norton: Yeah, I would just add, Rich, that as Susan said, we look at all the communities that we serve. We look at the demographics, and yet the capital investments are not that different from community to community. And we need to make sure that we are investing at the right level in all of those communities. New regulations like PFAS, but also the lead and copper rule, that is driving a lot of capital investment across the board and so we have to continue to do that and we need to do that in all the communities. So these affordability calculations, the risk priority model that we use, we think it's really the best balance to getting the right amount of infrastructure investment in all of the communities that we serve and as we grow the number of communities that we're serving, that will continue to increase, but we think we're getting the right balance there because we have to treat all of our customers in a fair way. They all deserve clean, safe drinking water.\nSusan Hardwick: And Cheryl, I might just add one additional comment. From a regulatory perspective, this is also a concept that we've been sharing very transparently with regulators. This affordability analysis that we've done, and as we lay out in every jurisdiction, the plan and the investments that we have made, we're right alongside it talking about impacts to customers and how we've thought about the plan and how it affects affordability for the customers in the service territory. So again, it's a concept and a view that we've taken that we think is differentiating here and I think regulators, just as one party, are certainly recognizing that.\nJohn Griffith: And Rich, I'll pick up on the 2% part of your question. As Susan mentioned in her commentary, 2% is a metric that we think is good to think about as a long-term metric given just the short-term variability around acquisitions, but you're right to point it out in this context. As you know, the 8% to 9% rate-based growth is what drives the 7% to 9% earnings growth, but being able to spread that 8% to 9% rate-based growth over a larger customer base is a healthy element of our growth.\nRichard Sunderland: Great. That was very helpful, color there. Thanks for laying all of that out. And then separately, turning to the financing plan here, you were clear on the drivers around the equity relative to the CapEx. I'm curious on the operating cash flow side. It looks like a significant step up, '24 to '20 versus '23 to '27, is that just normal course kind of rate recovery, any discrete items in there, just how to think about prior versus new?\nJohn Griffith: Yeah, it's a good question, Rich. Really, there is a big step up. If you think about the increase in our capital plan as we go back from 2021, 2022, 2023 and forward, it's such a significant step up that when you drop 2023 out of the plan and you bring 2028 into the plan, the accumulation of the capital spend through that period, it accounts for a very significant portion of that operating cash flow step up and then as you would also intuitively think, there is increased cash flow in the interim years as well, just given the increase in capital plan.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Well, thank you for the time today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America. Please proceed.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning, team. Just to clarify on that last line, confirm my understanding, so there's effectively no change in the growth triangle, as you call it, it's just kind of a representation.\nSusan Hardwick: Yeah, I think that's fair. We want to continue to emphasize that rate-based growth is the driver. Rate-based investment, which includes acquisitions, is the driver. What we're trying to do here, I think, is just give some clarity around or maybe a better view as to how you can measure our progress toward growth through acquisition by giving you that sort of metric around customer additions. The investment that we'll continue to make in acquisitions just rolls into rate-based, which it always has. So no real change in that. I just think it's a better view potentially for investors to be able to see progress we're making around the acquisition strategy.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. Understood. That's what I thought. And then shifting to the financing plan, so if I understand it right and correct me if I'm wrong, it doesn't assume any litigation proceeds, state funding, federal funding for PFAS. Is there any sense of what that kind of offset could be to help out on customer bills?\nSusan Hardwick: Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously, the numbers that we have laid out here, as Cheryl outlined, continue to be our best estimates of the cost necessary to meet the current proposed rule. Obviously, we don't have a rule yet. So finalizing those numbers will occur once we have a final rule and we do participate in the ongoing litigation around this whole issue. We've laid all that out in the Q. So you can look at that there and probably won't talk much more about it than that since it is ongoing litigation. I think it is fair to say that our estimates today are the costs we would expect to incur. We have to see how the litigation ultimately works out to see what impact that may have. And I think Cheryl covered this well. We do believe, by virtue of our participation in the litigation, that polluters should be our first line here of responsibility. So we are quite involved in that to make sure that that is properly executed.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay. To make sure, it does have an assumption around getting external funding or it does not?\nSusan Hardwick: It does not at this point, no. It is just the cost estimates that we have developed so far.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay, that is what I thought. Okay, great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Will Granger [ph] with Mizuho. Please proceed.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask, on the PFAS billion dollars that you have outlined today, how should we be thinking about the makeup of that over your service territories? Is it pretty radical? Yeah, if you could unpack the underlying assumptions there, that would be helpful.\nSusan Hardwick: Yeah, I will ask Cheryl to comment on that. We hit on, I think, a pretty high level, but Cheryl, you might want to just reemphasize that.\nCheryl Norton: Yeah, as we have looked at this, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we expect the bulk of the spend to be in our states where we have a larger footprint of customers, New Jersey, for example and the reason for that driver of that being the largest amount of spend is that there is more contamination there in general, but also these are large surface water plants that are very costly to add treatment to. We have Pennsylvania as a larger state, numerous locations there, but we really haven't outlined everywhere that we're going to add treatment, but anywhere that it's a surface water plant as opposed to a groundwater source is going to be a lot more costly to add that treatment and so New Jersey is our biggest dollar state for sure.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Got it. That's helpful and then maybe just on the equity for your plan, is that the incremental equity is just $700 million, if I've got my math right? The $300 million that you're planning to issue now and then an incremental $700 million, or is it an incremental billion?\nJohn Griffith: You've got it right, Will. It's an incremental $700 million.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Okay. And we should expect the timing of that to come in towards the back half of your plan, or would that be issued like as an ATM and just kind of pretty radical?\nJohn Griffith: What we've said is we'll issue it in the middle of our new 2024 to 2028 plan, subject to market conditions, obviously.\nUnidentifiedAnalyst: Got it. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Reeder with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.\nJonathan Reeder: Hey, good morning, team. Just kind of following up a little bit on that last question, despite the higher operating cash flows, it looks like the external capital needs increased more than the $2 billion CapEx increase. You've got the $700 million of equity, and then I think its $1.7 billion of debt. Anything unique going on there?\nJohn Griffith: No, Jonathan. We really lead this analysis by looking at our credit metrics, and so a lot of it just goes back to what we've said in the past, where incremental CapEx will fund at 50-50 debt and equity. As we think about equity there, it's internally generated funds as well as new issuance. So we think of it as lining up in that regard.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. No, I was just thinking the debt portion was a little higher than I would have thought.\nJohn Griffith: Yeah, that's just a function of the capital spend as well as the maturity schedule.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay, yeah, maybe the maturity schedule. Okay. So, Cheryl, I know you said that California filed on 10-16 to increase the '24 allowed ROE. Has there been any opposition filed to this request? I think there's like a 30-day comment period, which probably ended maybe yesterday.\nSusan Hardwick: Yeah, there is that 30-day period, and Jonathan, I am unaware of any kind of intervention or any kind of concern over that.\nCheryl Norton: Okay. It's pretty formulaic, Jonathan. Yeah, we don't expect there to be any issue with that. It really just follows a formula.\nJonathan Reeder: Yeah, no, I think investor concern is more on the electric side, whether you see some intervention than the water, but we monitor both. I think the 10-year CapEx plan, you bumped up the M&A placeholder by a billion. Is there anything specific driving that, or is that just kind of passage of time more than anything?\nJohn Griffith: Yeah, I'd say, Jonathan, it's certainly passage of time as part of it. We are investing in our capability across the system, starting with originations as well as due diligence and integrations. As we look at what happens when we make acquisitions and just our standards as a best-in-class operator relative to the systems that we acquire, we just continue to think that there's a lot of momentum there and a lot of strength in us as continuing this program. So it is a capability that we're investing significantly in and, yes, as you pointed out, as we move forward in time, we expect those numbers to become bigger to maintain that relative level of contribution.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And then last, you mentioned the pension costs for '24 and figuring that out, but do you have much exposure on that, or do most of your key states now have tracking mechanisms for pension?\nJohn Griffith: We have trackers and deferral accounts in certain states, Jonathan, and we can go through that with you in detail. So there's a mix there of what we pick up already and what would need to be picked up in the future.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions this morning.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. Please proceed.\nGregg Orrill: Good morning. I think you mentioned you're working on an acquisition in Pennsylvania of $104 million to close in late 2024-2025. How do you think about, when you go into acquisitions, sort of the reasonable timeline for getting approvals? How do you think about that?\nSusan Hardwick: John, you want to comment on that? I think the one you're referring to in particular is a little more complicated. I wouldn't say it's sort of a traditional process, the Towamencin acquisition. I recall we stepped into that arrangement when NextEra decided to exit the opportunity. So that one's just a little more complicated, but, John, you want to talk sort of typically how we think about the process around acquisitions?\nGregg Orrill: Yeah. And, Greg, it varies state to state, but since you mentioned Pennsylvania, there's a process you go through to file an application. The application has to be deemed complete, and then that starts a statutory clock and so in the case of Pennsylvania, there's a six-month statutory clock that runs through and then either you're settling your approval or you're litigating your approval, but all within that six-month statutory timetable and so what's different about this situation?\nJohn Griffith: Well, Towamencin is one where there's opportunity based on precedent in Pennsylvania. We'll see how the post-PUC approval plays out, but we're just allowing a little bit of latitude in the event that there's any follow-up to the PUC approval from interveners.\nOperator: The next question comes from Aditya Gandhi with Wolfe Research. Please proceed.\nAditya Gandhi: Good morning, Susan, Cheryl and John. Can you hear me?\nSusan Hardwick: We can. Good morning.\nAditya Gandhi: Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to start on PFAS. I'm curious to hear your latest thoughts around two specific topics. How are you thinking about the protection of water systems from any PFAS-related financial liability under CERCLA? Do you see risk if a final rule is released and it doesn't contain any protections and then the second topic is, can you maybe give some color on what portion of the $50 million additional annual O&M qualifies for [indiscernible] or expense mechanisms?\nCheryl Norton: I can take those questions. This is Cheryl. As far as protections around the SOCLA, we have been really engaged in that process, and we have been pushing really hard to ensure that water and wastewater utilities are protected in that space. And so we're going to continue to fight that battle. Right now, you're right, there is a little bit of vulnerability out there, but we feel pretty confident that we're going to be able to manage through that and that we're going to be able to impact how we're treated in that space. So more to come on that, but rest assured, we're going to fight like crazy to make sure that we are protected there. And as far as the $50 million, I don't have an exact breakdown, and we haven't talked about an exact breakdown from state to state. But whether or not that would be recovered through mechanisms just depends on the type of mechanisms that a state would have. So if they have a mechanism that would allow them to recover their production costs, any kind of tracker in that space would be really helpful in those costs. In some cases, we have environmental riders that include capital improvements. Some of them include capital and operating improvements, so that would allow them to recover those costs as well. So there's going to be a portion that we're going to be able to recover right up front, but the rest of them will just recover through a general rate case with very little lag, I would anticipate, as far as those costs are concerned.\nSusan Hardwick: Yeah, and the only thing I would add to that is where we don't have an existing mechanism or an approach to ensure timely recovery, we're going to work to design one. Our view here is that these are federally mandated costs, and we are taking care of a problem created by someone else and because of that federal mandate and the federal rule behind it, we think we'll have a great argument to make around recovery and timely recovery. So we'll be looking for where we don't have existing solutions, we'll be looking to create a new opportunity to do that. So there'll be a lot on the regulatory front here to do once we have a final rule and know how this plays out.\nCheryl Norton: Yeah, Susan, I would just add that that three-year implementation period that we have to put treatment in place gives us time to do those kinds of things and make those regulatory improvements.\nAditya Gandhi: Right. Got it. That's super helpful color. Thank you. And just one question for John, on the equity needs, you mentioned it's in the middle of your new '24 through '28 plans. So sort of in the '26 time frame. You're also going to have proceeds from the HOS note come in. I believe they're due at the end of 2026. Just can you add a little bit more color on timing and the form of equity? Is this just going to be like a straight block, or is this going to be some sort of forward where you'll maybe draw down on the forward over a couple of years? How should we think about that?\nJohn Griffith: Yeah, I would say that we're not close enough yet in terms of time to have made the decision on the exact form of equity. You're right on the timing of the HOS note proceeds, but as we approach the more immediate timing, then we'll develop our thinking closer to that point, but certainly, we'll look and do what's best for shareholders there. I'd say that you've seen us issue the straight equity as we did this year with the $1.7 billion. We issued the convert this year for $1 billion, and so we're willing to look at everything, but I'd say that's a decision we'll make as that time approaches.\nAditya Gandhi: Okay, got it and just one follow-up. Can you just clarify the point you made on your cash taxpayer status? I just wanted to confirm, is there a base for your 7% to 9% EPS CAGR at all, I can find that in the slides or the earnings release.\nJohn Griffith: Yeah, and let me just clarify, Aditya, on the equity that we've talked about, to be clear, it will be equity, not another instrument to replace the equity. With regards to our cash taxpayer status, with the Inflation Reduction Act, we do expect that we'll become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in the coming years. Those regulations are not finalized at this point, and there are certain elements that are in play that will dictate the precise timing for when we would become subject to the AMT, but we are expecting that to be the case for us. With regards to the 7% to 9% in a base year, I'd say on that, this is a target that we think of as a long-term target. You're aware that over the last few years, we reset the capital plan with the sale of HOS and the sale of New York, and we needed time to redeploy those proceeds, which was the case in '22 and '23 and as Susan pointed out, our '24 guidance reflects an 8% EPS CAGR at the midpoint. So we really think of 7% to 9% as a long-term target driven by the long-term 8% to 9% rate-based growth CAGR.\nAditya Gandhi: Got it. That's super helpful. Thanks for taking all my questions.\nOperator: At this time, we are showing no further questioners in the queue, and this does conclude our question-and-answer session as well as our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Before I jump into a discussion of our current long-term capital plan, starting on Slide eight, I want to first acknowledge that our teams have done a great job executing on our accelerated capital investment plans these last few years. We have consistently met our capital deployment goal and we're on pace to do it again by meeting our overall capital plan of $2.9 billion this year, which includes acquisition investments. Looking ahead to 2024, we expect a modest increase in our investment spending level to roughly $3.1 billion. Over the next five years, we expect to invest approximately $16 billion to $17 billion, an increase of about $2 billion over our previous plan. We expect constructive outcomes for this important water quality initiative, and we will continue to advocate that the ultimate responsibility for the clean-up of these contaminants should fall to the polluters. We will also continue to advocate that all water and wastewater utility providers, regardless of ownership, have equal access to any federal and or state funding related to treating PFAS. In addition, we'll continue our efforts to request permanent federal funding for a water and wastewater low-income customer assistance program. The other two drivers of increased CapEx in the 2024 to 2028 plan are a higher level of spend related to prioritized renewal projects across our footprint, such as for hydrant, pipe and meter replacement, as well as a higher level of expected follow-on capital related to future acquisitions. Following recent acquisitions, we have continued to experience a higher level of investment need in order to bring water and wastewater systems into regulatory compliance and up to our operating standards, which is driving the higher estimated capital need of $600 million. You can also see that we have deferred $500 million of lower risk projects to later years beyond the five-year plan. We did this as a part of our extensive risk-based project analysis in conjunction with our ongoing affordability analysis. For example, we deferred until later in the 10-year capital plan the replacement of some services in Maine where it was determined that they did not pose an immediate risk to service reliability or water quality. Let's turn to Slide 10 and I'll cover the latest regulatory activity across our states. Shown in the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states. Our general rate cases in California, Indiana, West Virginia and Kentucky, are all progressing well and as expected. All of these cases, except perhaps California, will most likely be resolved in early 2024. Just yesterday, we filed a general rate case in Virginia reflecting $110 million in system investments covering May 2023 through April 2025. We're seeking $20 million of additional annual revenue and expect interim rates to go into effect in May of next year. Outside of our general rate cases, as we discussed last quarter, we filed a request as authorized by California's water cost of capital mechanism seeking a 52 basis point increase to our ROE in 2023, which was approved on July 25, or increasing the return on equity to 9.5%, effective July 31. We filed a similar request in October for an additional 70 basis point increase to go into effect January 01, 2024, which would bring our ROE to 10.2%. And finally, related to the customers we have proudly served in the Monterey community for over 100 years, in October, a local entity adopted a resolution enabling it to file an eminent domain lawsuit with respect to the Monterey system assets. This is not a new issue, just the latest chapter in a long-running effort by an entity that we believe lacks the expertise to own and operate a very complex water distribution system serving these Monterey customers. Bottom line, we believe based upon existing legal precedent, we'll be able to successfully defend against an eminent domain lawsuit if it's filed. You can find more information on this topic in our SEC filings, including this quarter's 10-Q. Moving to Slide 11, I'll wrap up with a discussion of customer affordability and this new capital investment plan. Using U.S. Census Bureau data specific to the geographies we serve, our research and analysis concluded that projected rising levels of median household income combined with conservative assumptions around an increasing customer base would allow us to stay within our target for residential water bills of 1% or less of median household income. One of the most difficult challenges we face in the water and wastewater industry is balancing customer affordability with the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Thankfully, today, our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. At the same time, we realize we must continue to evolve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability. We must also continue our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale, and cost management in order to deliver on customer affordability. Our dual focus on operating efficiency and customer affordability has been a valuable part of our company's DNA for many years. As you know, we've historically used O&M efficiency as one of our benchmark metrics to measure our success at managing costs as we grow the business. In recent years, we've emphasized that revenue growth has been just as impactful to the O&M efficiency metric as managing costs. As we look ahead, we're continuing to evaluate whether this is the best metric by which to judge our effectiveness at managing costs and running an efficient business. More to come on this in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John? Yeah, I would just add, Rich, that as Susan said, we look at all the communities that we serve. We look at the demographics, and yet the capital investments are not that different from community to community. And we need to make sure that we are investing at the right level in all of those communities. New regulations like PFAS, but also the lead and copper rule, that is driving a lot of capital investment across the board and so we have to continue to do that and we need to do that in all the communities. So these affordability calculations, the risk priority model that we use, we think it's really the best balance to getting the right amount of infrastructure investment in all of the communities that we serve and as we grow the number of communities that we're serving, that will continue to increase, but we think we're getting the right balance there because we have to treat all of our customers in a fair way. They all deserve clean, safe drinking water. Yeah, as we have looked at this, as I mentioned in my comments earlier, we expect the bulk of the spend to be in our states where we have a larger footprint of customers, New Jersey, for example and the reason for that driver of that being the largest amount of spend is that there is more contamination there in general, but also these are large surface water plants that are very costly to add treatment to. We have Pennsylvania as a larger state, numerous locations there, but we really haven't outlined everywhere that we're going to add treatment, but anywhere that it's a surface water plant as opposed to a groundwater source is going to be a lot more costly to add that treatment and so New Jersey is our biggest dollar state for sure. Okay. It's pretty formulaic, Jonathan. Yeah, we don't expect there to be any issue with that. It really just follows a formula. I can take those questions. This is Cheryl. As far as protections around the SOCLA, we have been really engaged in that process, and we have been pushing really hard to ensure that water and wastewater utilities are protected in that space. And so we're going to continue to fight that battle. Right now, you're right, there is a little bit of vulnerability out there, but we feel pretty confident that we're going to be able to manage through that and that we're going to be able to impact how we're treated in that space. So more to come on that, but rest assured, we're going to fight like crazy to make sure that we are protected there. And as far as the $50 million, I don't have an exact breakdown, and we haven't talked about an exact breakdown from state to state. But whether or not that would be recovered through mechanisms just depends on the type of mechanisms that a state would have.

Yeah, Susan, I would just add that that three-year implementation period that we have to put treatment in place gives us time to do those kinds of things and make those regulatory improvements."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide five, and I'll start by covering some highlights from the third quarter and year-to-date periods. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter of 2023, and we're pleased to again reaffirm our 2023 guidance on a weather-normalized basis. Earnings were $1.66 per share for the quarter compared to $1.63 for the same period last year. In the first nine months of 2023, earnings were $4.03 per share compared to $3.70 per share in the same period of '22. The estimated net favorable weather impact year-to-date in '23 is about $0.11 per share compared to $0.06 per share favorable in '22. These weather-normalized results so far in 2023 continue to reflect our strong execution in line with our growth expectations for the year. John will elaborate further on results later. Moving on to some of our other key accomplishments to date in 2023, we have invested $1.8 billion in capital projects year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. As you will recall, the total capital investment planned for 2023 includes approximately $400 million of acquisitions, including one sizable transaction in Pennsylvania we expect to close in December and another in Illinois around the end of the year. As you know, we completed an equity issuance of $1.7 billion in March and a $1 billion convertible debt issuance in June. These were the two key priorities of our 2023 financing plan. We were focused on completing these issuances in the first half of the year to reduce market-related pricing risk and overall execution risk, which has served our investors, customers -- and our customers well, considering the current market conditions. Turning to Slide six, as we roll out our new five-year plan today, we are affirming our long-term targets, including 7% to 9% EPS and dividend compounded annual growth rates. We are also initiating our 2024 earnings guidance of $5.10 per share to $5.20 per share, which John will discuss further later in the discussion. This represents our expectation of 8% EPS growth in 2024 compared to our weather normalized 2023 EPS guidance. One thing to note on this slide is that we have revised the look of our earnings growth outlook. Recall that we'd historically referred to it as our growth triangle. We believe this new version better highlights our compelling 7% to 9% earnings growth expectation and better represents the key drivers of growth. As a nearly 100% regulated water and wastewater utility, rate-based growth and regulatory execution are the key drivers of growth for our company. Rate-based growth continues to be driven by the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth two years ago and now with this updated plan. Combined with our robust regulated acquisition strategy on which we've proven we can execute, we continue to expect 8% to 9% rate-based growth over the next decade. Later, Cheryl will review the amount of capital we expect to spend over the next five years, including related to acquisitions. On this slide, you can see we are highlighting our acquisition growth strategy measured by a compounded annual growth rate in customer connections of 2%. The timing of closing on acquisitions is often difficult to control within a calendar year, which can cause volatility in acquisition investment on a year-to-year basis. This 2% customer additions CAGR target should be an easier way for investors to monitor and measure our growth through acquisitions. And as I said, rate-based growth, which includes acquisition investment is the key driver to earnings growth. Our growth outlook also includes the organic revenue growth opportunities we expect from our military services group from the 18 installations we currently serve with an added upside for any new bases secured. One of our company's competitive advantages is its diverse regulated operations across 14 states that provides us with flexibility in the timing of rate cases and capital deployment. We also have a very predictable and controllable set of capital projects annually, almost half of which are recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms. Along with our other regulatory approaches, we are confident we can deliver consistent earnings growth and dividend growth over the next five years and beyond. While utility stocks, including ours, have seen the impact on the short term of higher interest rates, history has shown that over medium and longer term horizons, the utility sector and certainly American Water has delivered compelling value to investors. We believe the combination of our EPS and dividend growth supported by our significant yet low risk capital investment plan and our focus on customer affordability and ESG leadership will continue to be rewarded by investors. Based on this long-term plan and our history of executing on our strategies, we intend to continue to deliver a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return for many years to come. With that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment plan and our focus on customer affordability and regulatory execution. Cheryl? Thanks, John. To close on Slide 20, you've heard our latest strategic thinking today, and it should sound very familiar. It's all about execution at every level. As we continue to demonstrate our ability to consistently execute, we believe our industry leading EPS and dividend growth, combined with our focus on affordability and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and strategy separate us from all utilities. They are underpinned by our significant low-risk capital investment plan, which includes our best-in-class execution on acquisitions and our excellent regulatory execution, all while maintaining a strong balance sheet with a well-planned debt maturity profile and a differentiated affordability proposition. Through our consistent achievement of high operating standards, including our leading safety culture and water quality accolades, our team at American Water has raised the bar for success in the water and wastewater industry and that includes the outstanding efforts by our Military Services Group team to proudly serve the 18 military installations in our footprint. Our history of executing on our strategies has delivered a very competitive, sustainable shareholder return. With this long-term plan, we have full confidence in our ability to achieve the goals we talked about today and continue our track record of delivering superior shareholder value. And with that, let me turn the call back over to Chris to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have. You are, Rich. Good morning. Okay, Rich, yeah, there's a lot in there. Let me start and then Cheryl and John can add to it. I would say our focus has sharpened over the last number of years related to customer affordability. And that sharpened focus, I think, has really been around this sort of wallet share concept that Cheryl talked about. I think it's important for us to understand the communities that we operate in and the demographics of those communities and what are the challenges of customers in those communities and we've been able to do a lot of analysis at a very detailed level around affordability, around household income, around just economic impacts in the various communities that we serve and our focus has been, I think, very clearly defined around our wallet share as a percentage of that household income and we've been developing this concept here now for a number of years and I think that our ability to confidently say this plan as we've continued to grow it, we'll continue to maintain our position of roughly 1% or less of a customer's bill in the communities that we serve specifically and I think that focus has allowed us to really think about how to build this plan, how to continue to grow it, how to continue to grow rate base while not overburdening customers with our growth expectations. I think this plan fits very nicely in that concept. Cheryl, you want to add anything? And Cheryl, I might just add one additional comment. From a regulatory perspective, this is also a concept that we've been sharing very transparently with regulators. This affordability analysis that we've done, and as we lay out in every jurisdiction, the plan and the investments that we have made, we're right alongside it talking about impacts to customers and how we've thought about the plan and how it affects affordability for the customers in the service territory. So again, it's a concept and a view that we've taken that we think is differentiating here and I think regulators, just as one party, are certainly recognizing that. Yeah, I think that's fair. We want to continue to emphasize that rate-based growth is the driver. Rate-based investment, which includes acquisitions, is the driver. What we're trying to do here, I think, is just give some clarity around or maybe a better view as to how you can measure our progress toward growth through acquisition by giving you that sort of metric around customer additions. The investment that we'll continue to make in acquisitions just rolls into rate-based, which it always has. So no real change in that. I just think it's a better view potentially for investors to be able to see progress we're making around the acquisition strategy. Yeah, it's a good question. Obviously, the numbers that we have laid out here, as Cheryl outlined, continue to be our best estimates of the cost necessary to meet the current proposed rule. Obviously, we don't have a rule yet. So finalizing those numbers will occur once we have a final rule and we do participate in the ongoing litigation around this whole issue. We've laid all that out in the Q. So you can look at that there and probably won't talk much more about it than that since it is ongoing litigation. I think it is fair to say that our estimates today are the costs we would expect to incur. We have to see how the litigation ultimately works out to see what impact that may have. And I think Cheryl covered this well. We do believe, by virtue of our participation in the litigation, that polluters should be our first line here of responsibility. So we are quite involved in that to make sure that that is properly executed. It does not at this point, no. It is just the cost estimates that we have developed so far. Yeah, I will ask Cheryl to comment on that. We hit on, I think, a pretty high level, but Cheryl, you might want to just reemphasize that. Yeah, there is that 30-day period, and Jonathan, I am unaware of any kind of intervention or any kind of concern over that. John, you want to comment on that? I think the one you're referring to in particular is a little more complicated. I wouldn't say it's sort of a traditional process, the Towamencin acquisition. I recall we stepped into that arrangement when NextEra decided to exit the opportunity. So that one's just a little more complicated, but, John, you want to talk sort of typically how we think about the process around acquisitions? We can. Good morning. Yeah, and the only thing I would add to that is where we don't have an existing mechanism or an approach to ensure timely recovery, we're going to work to design one. Our view here is that these are federally mandated costs, and we are taking care of a problem created by someone else and because of that federal mandate and the federal rule behind it, we think we'll have a great argument to make around recovery and timely recovery. So we'll be looking for where we don't have existing solutions, we'll be looking to create a new opportunity to do that. So there'll be a lot on the regulatory front here to do once we have a final rule and know how this plays out."

            "name": "John Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 13, let me provide a few more details on year-to-date results. The appendix also has details of third quarter EPS, which has many of the same drivers as year-to-date results. Consolidated earnings were $4.03 per share year-to-date, up $0.33 per share compared to the same period in 2022, and up $0.28 per share on a weather normalized basis. Increased revenues were driven by general rate cases we completed in late 2022 and early 2023 in our larger states. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we have made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher year-to-date by an estimated net $0.11 per share as a result of weather in the second and third quarters due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. This compares to net favorable weather in the third quarter of 2022 of $0.06 per share, which related mostly to warm and dry conditions in New Jersey. In looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.10 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.09 per share, including inflationary pressures, are being recovered in large part through higher revenues we proactively sought through the use of forward test years and traditional updates to base cost of service and general rate cases we completed in the last 12 months to 18 months. This strategy has limited the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023 and is a strategy we are continuing to use in our recently filed and upcoming cases. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.17 per share, and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.28 per share, primarily related to share count dilution. As I mentioned last quarter, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance offsets the avoided interest expense in the current interest rate environment. We expect the impact to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well, based on the current outlook. Turning to Slide 14, this graph illustrates that our continued execution on capital investments, both infrastructure projects and acquisitions, are succeeding in growing regulated rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate-based growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the high degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis. Turning to Slide 15, you'll see that we continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions. We closed on 14 acquisitions, totalling $36 million across six states in the first nine months of 2023, which demonstrates our continued ability to close deals in many states. We also had 32 transactions under agreement across 10 states through the end of September, totalling $611 million, two of which we closed in early October, including one in West Virginia for $27 million. This total also includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois we previously announced. We expect the Butler acquisition to close later this year in Granite City around year end, pending regulatory approvals for each, and we look forward to serving those customers. Also included in our acquisitions under agreement is the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania we expect to purchase for $104 million, as announced back in March. We expect to close this acquisition in late 2024 or early 2025, pending final regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving those customers as well. Our outlook for future acquisitions remains very strong, as we expect to have over $250 million of acquisitions under agreement at the end of 2023 after the expected closings of Butler and Granite City. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our rate-based growth outlook. On Slide 16, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2024 results in our newly established EPS guidance range of $5.10 to $5.20 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by capital investment to serve our customers and earning a return on that investment. As we've talked about previously, 2023 is year two of our accelerated CapEx plan following the HOS sale. So we see that ramp up reflected in earnings in 2024, both from base rate increases and infrastructure mechanisms. As a reminder, approximately 45% of our CapEx is recoverable by infrastructure mechanisms, so it's a very meaningful driver of consistent earnings growth for us. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year. I'd like to note that our military services group does add incrementally to our earnings growth expectation, as we have continued to show in our growth outlook. MSG's great work on the 18 military installations it serves has built trust and resulted in the U.S. government allocating additional funds for improvement projects, driving increased revenues. Just as critical to our growth strategy is our ability to prudently manage the operating costs it takes to run the business, which goes to my final point on this slide. Because of our strong culture of operating efficiency and cost management, we expect only modest increases in O&M in 2024. These efforts go to the heart of the customer affordability construct we want to protect, which is closely aligned with the interests of regulators and ultimately investors in managing affordability of customer bills. Finally, related to pension, I'd simply remind you that our pension obligation remeasurement will be done at yearend 2023, and that will drive the determination of our 2024 pension expense. Turning to Slide 17, I'll provide a financing plan update before closing with a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile. In our prior five-year plan through 2027, we expected a total of $2 billion of equity financing need. We successfully issued $1.7 billion of the $2 billion earlier this year, leaving $300 million of equity financing needed toward the end of that prior plan. Based on our new capital plan, our financing plan now includes an estimated $1 billion of equity issuances from 2024 through 2028. The $1 billion of equity in our new plan is expected to be issued near the middle of the 2024 to 2028 period, subject to market conditions. The $700 million increase in the anticipated external equity need is driven by the incremental $2 billion of CapEx in the new plan. As we've said many times now, we expect incremental CapEx to be funded roughly 50-50 debt and equity, which includes both external equity and cash flow from operations. Our financing plan design also takes into account the goal of maintaining a strong balance sheet and continuing to meet our long-term debt-to-capital target of less than 60%. Another assumption inherent in our new plan is that we will continue to be a cash taxpayer, especially as we will likely become subject to the new corporate alternative minimum tax in the coming years. On Slide 18, we provide a summary of our continued strong financial condition. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, net of roughly $630 million of cash on hand remains at 54%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. As we are all aware, the current higher interest rate environment is challenging. We are, however, in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with the challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances. We remain confident that we will have strong access to capital for the long term. In fact, we just extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to October 2028, which has a capacity of $2.75 billion. Our diversified banking relationships with some of the largest and strongest banks in the world, coupled with our fully regulated business model and strong credit ratings, gives us great confidence around liquidity. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is very important in environments like the current one to manage cash flows and minimize interest rate risk, which contributes to managing customer affordability. And our short duration between general rate cases allows us to minimize any lag we may experience related to recovery of debt costs. With that, I'll turn it back over to Susan for some closing thoughts. Susan? And Rich, I'll pick up on the 2% part of your question. As Susan mentioned in her commentary, 2% is a metric that we think is good to think about as a long-term metric given just the short-term variability around acquisitions, but you're right to point it out in this context. As you know, the 8% to 9% rate-based growth is what drives the 7% to 9% earnings growth, but being able to spread that 8% to 9% rate-based growth over a larger customer base is a healthy element of our growth. Yeah, it's a good question, Rich. Really, there is a big step up. If you think about the increase in our capital plan as we go back from 2021, 2022, 2023 and forward, it's such a significant step up that when you drop 2023 out of the plan and you bring 2028 into the plan, the accumulation of the capital spend through that period, it accounts for a very significant portion of that operating cash flow step up and then as you would also intuitively think, there is increased cash flow in the interim years as well, just given the increase in capital plan. You've got it right, Will. It's an incremental $700 million. What we've said is we'll issue it in the middle of our new 2024 to 2028 plan, subject to market conditions, obviously. No, Jonathan. We really lead this analysis by looking at our credit metrics, and so a lot of it just goes back to what we've said in the past, where incremental CapEx will fund at 50-50 debt and equity. As we think about equity there, it's internally generated funds as well as new issuance. So we think of it as lining up in that regard. Yeah, that's just a function of the capital spend as well as the maturity schedule. Yeah, I'd say, Jonathan, it's certainly passage of time as part of it. We are investing in our capability across the system, starting with originations as well as due diligence and integrations. As we look at what happens when we make acquisitions and just our standards as a best-in-class operator relative to the systems that we acquire, we just continue to think that there's a lot of momentum there and a lot of strength in us as continuing this program. So it is a capability that we're investing significantly in and, yes, as you pointed out, as we move forward in time, we expect those numbers to become bigger to maintain that relative level of contribution. We have trackers and deferral accounts in certain states, Jonathan, and we can go through that with you in detail. So there's a mix there of what we pick up already and what would need to be picked up in the future. Well, Towamencin is one where there's opportunity based on precedent in Pennsylvania. We'll see how the post-PUC approval plays out, but we're just allowing a little bit of latitude in the event that there's any follow-up to the PUC approval from interveners. Yeah, I would say that we're not close enough yet in terms of time to have made the decision on the exact form of equity. You're right on the timing of the HOS note proceeds, but as we approach the more immediate timing, then we'll develop our thinking closer to that point, but certainly, we'll look and do what's best for shareholders there. I'd say that you've seen us issue the straight equity as we did this year with the $1.7 billion. We issued the convert this year for $1 billion, and so we're willing to look at everything, but I'd say that's a decision we'll make as that time approaches. Yeah, and let me just clarify, Aditya, on the equity that we've talked about, to be clear, it will be equity, not another instrument to replace the equity. With regards to our cash taxpayer status, with the Inflation Reduction Act, we do expect that we'll become subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax in the coming years. Those regulations are not finalized at this point, and there are certain elements that are in play that will dictate the precise timing for when we would become subject to the AMT, but we are expecting that to be the case for us. With regards to the 7% to 9% in a base year, I'd say on that, this is a target that we think of as a long-term target. You're aware that over the last few years, we reset the capital plan with the sale of HOS and the sale of New York, and we needed time to redeploy those proceeds, which was the case in '22 and '23 and as Susan pointed out, our '24 guidance reflects an 8% EPS CAGR at the midpoint. So we really think of 7% to 9% as a long-term target driven by the long-term 8% to 9% rate-based growth CAGR."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the American Water's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast within the accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I will now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Sasha. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the second quarter earnings release and in our June 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will share highlights of second quarter and year-to-date results and thoughts on our affirmed 2023 EPS guidance and longer-term targets. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our successful financing activities in the first half of the year, cover our financial results in more detail, and we'll close with an update on our acquisition activity. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan, regulatory updates and will conclude with a review of our recently published sustainability report and other new disclosures. We'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick : Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and the first half of 2023. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter compared to $1.20 for the same period last year. In the first 6 months of 2023, earnings were $2.37 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the same period of 2022. The results were in line with our expectations as we knew the first half of the year would be strong compared to last year due to revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings completed in '22, and in early '23 and from infrastructure mechanism filings. We continue to execute on our regulatory strategy, which continues to be the key driver of our results. Revenues in the second quarter were also higher due to increased usage from warm and unusually dry weather in several of our states. Tempering results were higher operating costs, which John will elaborate on further. Moving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023. We invested nearly $1.2 billion in capital projects year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. Also, as you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2023 includes approximately $400 million for acquisitions, including 2 sizable transactions we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Our outlook for future acquisitions remains strong as we have over $550 million of acquisitions under agreement, including those 2 sizable deals. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan. And as we announced last month, we completed a convertible debt issuance of just over $1 billion that achieved the other key element of our 2023 financing plan. Finally, earlier this week, we were pleased to publish our company's latest sustainability report. Cheryl will share a few highlights of the report, but at its core, it tells the story of how we are fulfilling our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service in a very sustainable way to American Water customers. And this has been our mission for over 135 years. Turning to Slide 6. We are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 per share to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. And once again, we are affirming our long-term targets. I continue to believe that our regulatory -- our strong regulatory financing and operational execution is the differentiator from our peers.  Our track record of executing on these fronts gives us confidence and should give investors confidence in our ability to achieve our short-term and our long-term financial targets. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently grow earnings and dividends at a top-tier pace over the next 5 years and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover some second quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John?\nJohn Griffith : Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I'll start by reviewing the successful completion of our 2023 financing plan. As Susan mentioned, and as I covered on the last call, earlier this year, we completed an upsized equity offering for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity is expected to be issued near the end of this 5-year plan, as we've previously communicated. Then last month, we issued just over $1 billion of exchangeable senior notes due in 2026 with an annual interest rate of 3.625%. As we previously disclosed, this exchangeable debt issuance supports our long-term growth as a diversified low-cost funding source that benefits customer affordability and shareholder value. Upon any exchange of the notes, the principal amount will be settled in cash with flexibility to settle any remaining value above the principal amount in cash, shares or a combination thereof at our election. We used the proceeds from both of these transactions to bring our commercial paper balance to zero by quarter end with almost $800 million of cash yet to be utilized, that is earning interest. With our 2023 long-term financing needs now complete, our balance sheet is well positioned to fund our robust water and wastewater investment growth. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our continued strong financial condition, our total debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash on the balance sheet remains at 54% as of June 30, which is well below our target of 60%. We believe our current debt maturity levels in conjunction with future debt needs are very manageable. And I would remind you, as shown on this slide, of the $720 million of no proceeds that we will receive in 2026 from the sale of HOS completed in 2021. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is important to manage cash flows and minimize interest rate risk. And finally, on liquidity, we remain confident that we will have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. Turning to Slide 10. I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter of $0.24 per share versus the same period in 2022, and up $0.17 per share on a weather-normalized basis. As you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we have made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher in the quarter by an estimated $0.07 per share due to weather in 2023 due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But we did see unusual weather in the quarter resulting in higher throughput, which we typically don't see during this time of year, our investments in resiliency and our proactive communications to customers around water conservation, ensured that we did not experience any significant operating issues during the quarter. And looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.04 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.03 per share, including inflationary pressures were largely mitigated by the higher revenues. Based on the current outlook, we are not expecting the cost of chemicals to decrease in the near term as demand remains elevated. Our operating costs in the second quarter also increased due to a higher employee headcount to support growth in the business. As we've said, our proactive strategy last year to seek [rate] of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom-line impact of those higher costs in 2023. This approach continues in our recently filed cases. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.06 per share and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.11 per share primarily related to share count dilution. As I mentioned last quarter, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance offsets the avoided expense and the current interest rate environment. We expect the impact to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well based on the current outlook. Turning to Slide 11. Earnings increased $0.30 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, earnings have increased $0.23 per share year-to-date, which, as Susan mentioned, is in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. Before we look at our expected full year 2023 EPS details, I should note that, as you would expect in the year of an equity issuance, our quarterly EPS results may not sum to equal the year-to-date EPS results each quarter. This is simply due to a different amount of average shares outstanding used in the EPS calculations as the year progresses. Turning to Slide 12. I'll echo Susan's comments that our results remain on track to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Here, we provide some updated details related to 2023 guidance that reflect results so far this year, including the completed 2023 financing plan. You can see, for example, that our implied revenue growth for the second half of the year will be strong, though somewhat less than the first half growth as new rates became effective in New Jersey last September. Looking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place, including our strengthened balance sheet to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today. Turning to Slide 13, you'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We closed on 10 acquisitions totaling $33 million across 5 states in the first half of 2023, which demonstrates our continued ability to close deals in many states. We also had 32 transactions under agreement across 10 states through the end of June totaling $555 million and includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania, and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois we previously announced. We now expect to close both of these transactions near the end of 2023 pending regulatory approvals for each.  Also included in our acquisitions under agreement is the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we expect to purchase for $104 million as announced back in March. We continue to expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, pending regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving all of these customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. With our track record of closing on acquisitions and executing on our CapEx plans, we are confident that we will achieve our capital investment plan of $2.9 billion for 2023. And when you combine that with the financing we have already completed to fund growth, we believe our outlook for 2023 and beyond is very attractive for investors. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton : Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by commenting on our continued focus on investing in our systems. Slide 15 shows a recap of our capital investment so far in 2023.  As John said, we remain on plan to meet our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of total capital spending for the full year. Our state teams continue to execute each quarter on the multitude of projects that improve our systems. Two examples of the types of projects we're working on are improvements to the lime softening system, chemical facilities and filters at the Jerseyville, Illinois water treatment plan and enhanced aeration capabilities and other digester improvements at the Coatesville water treatment plant in Pennsylvania. These renewal and improvement projects are typical examples of how the capital we deploy is essential to our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable drinking water and wastewater services. And finally, as John mentioned, our larger acquisitions in 2023 are expected to occur in the second half of the year as compared to 2022, when the first half of the year included our largest acquisition for the year, over $200 million for the City of York's wastewater system. Let's go to Slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states. Sharing with our -- starting with our general rate cases in California and Indiana, both are progressing as expected. In Indiana, hearings are expected in early fall, which follows testimony filed by all parties in July and August. In California, we expect hearings in the fall as well. At the beginning of May, we filed a general rate case in West Virginia, reflecting $340 million in water and wastewater system investments covering 2020 through 2025. We are seeking $45 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges, we would expect an order in February of next year. At the end of June, we filed a general rate case in Kentucky reflecting $330 million in water system investments since the last rate case order in 2019. We are seeking $26 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges to support continued safe and reliable service and recovery of increased production costs. We would expect an order in this case in February of next year. In Missouri, we were pleased to receive a final decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission in May. The negotiated settlement reflects the increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges. Though not specifically noted in the order, our view of the return on equity allowed is 9.75%, and the equity ratio is 50%. Outside of general rate cases, the California Commission issued a decision on June 29 on California American Water's 2021 cost of capital application authorizing an 8.98% ROE with an equity component of 57.04%. The decision was not retroactive and will be effective through the end of 2024. The following day, we filed an advice letter as authorized by the state's water cost of capital mechanism seeking a 52 basis point increase to our ROE in 2023, which was approved on July 25, increasing the return on equity to 9.50% effective July 31. As Susan mentioned, our regulatory execution is a key driver of our results and our team continues to do an excellent job. As we previously discussed, we submitted written comments on the federal EPA's proposed PFOS rule in May. The key concern that we voiced is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated. Our internal and preliminary estimates show that capital investments in excess of $1 billion will be needed by American Water, along with nearly $50 million of annual operating expenses in order to comply with the rule as currently proposed. We are still evaluating the potential impact of our 5-year capital plan, including whether PFOS will drive incremental CapEx in the plan or if some currently planned projects will be completed later beyond the 5-year horizon or both. We expect to have more to share on that in the third quarter earnings call. Related to ongoing PFOS litigation and the announcement of some settlements with manufacturers of PFOS, we are a long way from knowing what these settlements mean for our customers, including if, how and when funds from these settlements or other litigation may ultimately be distributed. We will continue to advocate that the ultimate responsibility for the cleanup of these contaminants should fall to the polluters, and we will continue to work cooperatively with the EPA and with Congress, regulators and policymakers in support of water quality standards that protect customers and communities balanced with affordability. Another topic that's been in the news recently is around certain telecommunication companies and their historical usage of lead insulated cables. While these stories don't relate to American Water, we'd remind you to review the disclosures we've had for many years in our Form 10-K around the replacement of lead service lines in our regulated service territories. We are in great shape related to that replacement program. Finally, on Slide 17, earlier this week, we released our latest sustainability report covering the years 2021 and 2022. This report highlights our commitment to excellent water quality, customer affordability and continued investing in water and wastewater infrastructure and our sustainable business practices and values that align with these commitments. To demonstrate our ESG leadership and commitment to transparency, we also continue to expand and update disclosures related to how we operate the business, some of which we've referenced here. And we're pleased to continue to be recognized by leading ESG rating services such as MSCI for our actions and our disclosures in this space. One final comment before I wrap up. As you know, there have been several weather events this quarter, including the severe flooding in New York State. While we no longer have regulated utility operations there, we do operate the water system and 2 wastewater treatment plants at U.S. Military Academy West Point through our Military Services Group business. Our teams there went above and beyond to ensure West Point could continue to operate and have continued access to safe and reliable water and wastewater services, and we did so safely. Our teams across the entire business are experts at what they do every day. We thank them and are grateful for their commitment and expertise in delivering to those we serve and doing so in a safe and sustainable way.  With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Paul Zimbardo from Bank of America.\nPaul Zimbardo : Great. The first question I had was, I know there was a good number of changes on the drivers within full year '23 guidance. If you could just unpack like where were you seeing that better revenue net O&M strength in the year-to-date or second half, wherever it lands.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Let me comment first and certainly, John can add to it. I think really it's -- you can look on the revenue side, primarily timing of rate cases and the resulting revenue increases and then also additional costs that we have built into those rate cases. We've been talking quite a bit about inflationary impacts and higher chemical costs and production costs, and we've been successful in getting those higher costs built into a number of the cases we did last year. And as those cost increases have gone up, the associated revenue recovery has gone up. So I'd say those are the primary drivers. On the sort of financing cost side, those changes really driven by just the timing of primarily this long-term debt issue we just did and then higher costs associated with short-term debt financing. I think, John, that probably covers the main ones. Any other items to add?\nJohn Griffith: Yes, I think it does. That's right. Paul, we started to pick up New Jersey revenue last September, so that moderates year-over-year growth. And I'd say on from an inflation perspective, we're starting to see production costs moderate as we've come through the second quarter here.\nPaul Zimbardo : Okay. Great. And then on the balance sheet side, I know a great job cleaning up, taking out all that short-term debt. On the long term, 1 question I had was, I noticed you changed the language slightly to equal to or less than 60% debt to total cap versus before it\u2019s just less than 60%. Does that mean you anticipate that trending up closer to 60%? Just overall thoughts on kind of where you stand on that going through the long-term plan?\nJohn Griffith: Yes. Paul, no real change there as we\u2019re thinking about it. As you know, we\u2019re raising financing in a periodic sort of manner. So we do expect to trend up over time until we reset again with equity, but no significant change there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport.\nAngie Storozynski : So first, maybe -- you mentioned the rainy July in New York State. I mean it's for us living in the Mid-Atlantic, it seems like it's been the weather pattern in New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well. So is there any sense how -- if there's an offset to that $0.07 weather benefit from the second quarter thus far in the third quarter?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, Angie, we don't have any sort of prediction so far on impacts in July. I'd just remind you again that our outlook for the year remains on track to hit our expectations, again, on a weather-normalized basis. So just a bit early to tell what impact July may have across the entire territory.\nAngie Storozynski : Okay. Secondly, the exchangeable bonds that you guys did, I mean they came at a low coupon likely -- I mean, probably not something that you have considered in your guidance. So should I think that it's actually a benefit to guidance? And also, how does that tie up to the financing of those 2 big acquisitions that you expect to close later this year? Were they always planned to close still in '23. Again, I'm just trying to see if there's any benefit from an interest expense perspective.\nSusan Hardwick: I'll answer the second part first and then ask John to sort of come the financing impacts. We continue to look very closely at the timing of those 2 transactions. And we've always expected them to be sort of at or close to year-end. That's still our expectation. That's been built in our plan all along. The regulatory process is a bit unpredictable, but we feel confident about the ability to get those wrapped up right towards the end of this year. John, you want to comment on the financing piece.\nJohn Griffith: Angie, I would just say on the financing piece that we set our plan last fall at a time when we can't predict interest rates. And I think where we've come out on the convert is consistent with our guidance and our affirmation of 2023.\nAngie Storozynski : Okay. And my last question on the municipal M&A. So you've been very successful at those very large acquisitions even though some other companies have stumbled from those. Is this very much sort of a deal specific issue. So there's no any deterioration in the regulatory environment or the receptivity of municipalities to sell large assets? I mean, again, we're trying to see if there's a trend, you seem to be way more successful than others in large municipal M&A?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. I think, Angie, I'll say what I always say here, I think we are very good at it. I think we spend a lot of time in these communities, cultivating the relationship. Our teams are very much embedded in these communities. I think they work closely with communities to define the need and to come up with the best solutions to meet those needs. I think that is continuing to be our strongest asset as it relates to acquisitions. I think the prospect for deals also continues to evolve. And I'd say these larger deals have come about I think because circumstances warranted. It doesn't signal a change in our strategy. It doesn't signal a change in what I believe to be the environment either for opportunity or regulatory acceptance or enthusiasm for deals generally. So I'd just say they're circumstantial, and our expertise, I think, continues to be a real advantage we have here.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregg Orrill from UBS.\nGregg Orrill : Regarding the Indiana rate case proceeding on schedule, are you expecting revenue recommendations from interveners? So is that coming up?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, I think the normal process would be to have testimony filed with all the parties in the case, sort of later this summer, early fall. So I think the normal process, we would expect to see sort of full recommendations or positions taken by the various parties through that process.\nGregg Orrill : Okay. Sort of traditional process like other places?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Yes, really nothing different.\nOperator: The next question is from Shar Pourreza from Guggenheim Partners.\nJames Kennedy: It's actually James on for Shar. I guess, just -- First question was just on the PFAS figures, so the $1 billion. I guess, could you just speak to maybe the puts and takes as it relates to your ability to update with the capital plan on the third quarter call. What, I guess, a little bit more color on how we should think about what of that $1 billion can roll into the forthcoming plan?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, it's a good question and it's something obviously we're continuing to work on. And Cheryl alluded to this in her comments, we would expect to have quite a bit more visibility on our third quarter call, partly because our evaluation is certainly ongoing and our continued analysis of our various facilities to see where we may have exposure and what sort of treatment may be necessary. So that process is continuing. But I'd also just say this is the time of year where we're doing all of our work relative to our financial plan. All the various updates throughout the business, and our capital planning is certainly a big part of that. So our normal cadence would be to continue to work through that planning process and be complete with it in the early fall with the expectation that we would roll out our guidance and expectations for the next year and then the next 5-year and even 10-year outlook relative to capital when we get to that third quarter call. So we're just on sort of a normal cadence from a planning perspective. And then, as I said, on the evaluation of potential exposure. We're just still in the process of doing that work. And Cheryl, anything to add there?\nCheryl Norton: No. I would just say that we also continue to collect samples at all these locations to just verify what the levels are and look for any seasonal kinds of variations and such as that. So we're still drilling into the details, but as Susan said, as we go through our regular planning process, we're using our prioritization models and deciding what could we move out or not move out. And so it's a lot of work and the teams really dug into the details right now.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. And I think that is the key. We just need to complete that risk analysis piece, and we'll see how much of this $1 billion ultimately results in incremental capital expansion of the plan versus just shifting to later periods, shifting other work to later periods.\nJames Kennedy: And I guess just the follow-up to that, too, is just the -- so we've got a few different regulations, EPA, a little uncertain over the circular designations. But has any of this changed your near-term approach to wastewater M&A?\nSusan Hardwick: No, I don't think so. We're continuing to look at that as a very important part of our strategy and continuing to look at those opportunities. We think there's a good set of opportunities in that space, largely driven again by just the aging infrastructure and how many of those systems were built initially and then many of them coming to sort of the end of their useful life. So we think the opportunities are plentiful. I would say it doesn't change our strategy relative to that. But I do think, as we think about sort of total capital allocation and from a risk perspective and a growth opportunity perspective, we'll manage all of those opportunities within our capital financing capabilities.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] This concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference call has now concluded. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by commenting on our continued focus on investing in our systems. Slide 15 shows a recap of our capital investment so far in 2023.  As John said, we remain on plan to meet our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of total capital spending for the full year. Our state teams continue to execute each quarter on the multitude of projects that improve our systems. Two examples of the types of projects we're working on are improvements to the lime softening system, chemical facilities and filters at the Jerseyville, Illinois water treatment plan and enhanced aeration capabilities and other digester improvements at the Coatesville water treatment plant in Pennsylvania. These renewal and improvement projects are typical examples of how the capital we deploy is essential to our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable drinking water and wastewater services. And finally, as John mentioned, our larger acquisitions in 2023 are expected to occur in the second half of the year as compared to 2022, when the first half of the year included our largest acquisition for the year, over $200 million for the City of York's wastewater system. Let's go to Slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on the slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate case in our top 10 states. Sharing with our -- starting with our general rate cases in California and Indiana, both are progressing as expected. In Indiana, hearings are expected in early fall, which follows testimony filed by all parties in July and August. In California, we expect hearings in the fall as well. At the beginning of May, we filed a general rate case in West Virginia, reflecting $340 million in water and wastewater system investments covering 2020 through 2025. We are seeking $45 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges, we would expect an order in February of next year. At the end of June, we filed a general rate case in Kentucky reflecting $330 million in water system investments since the last rate case order in 2019. We are seeking $26 million of additional annual revenue, excluding infrastructure surcharges to support continued safe and reliable service and recovery of increased production costs. We would expect an order in this case in February of next year. In Missouri, we were pleased to receive a final decision from the Missouri Public Service Commission in May. The negotiated settlement reflects the increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges. Though not specifically noted in the order, our view of the return on equity allowed is 9.75%, and the equity ratio is 50%. Outside of general rate cases, the California Commission issued a decision on June 29 on California American Water's 2021 cost of capital application authorizing an 8.98% ROE with an equity component of 57.04%. The decision was not retroactive and will be effective through the end of 2024. The following day, we filed an advice letter as authorized by the state's water cost of capital mechanism seeking a 52 basis point increase to our ROE in 2023, which was approved on July 25, increasing the return on equity to 9.50% effective July 31. As Susan mentioned, our regulatory execution is a key driver of our results and our team continues to do an excellent job. As we previously discussed, we submitted written comments on the federal EPA's proposed PFOS rule in May. The key concern that we voiced is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated.

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the second quarter and the first half of 2023. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter compared to $1.20 for the same period last year. In the first 6 months of 2023, earnings were $2.37 per share compared to $2.07 per share in the same period of 2022. The results were in line with our expectations as we knew the first half of the year would be strong compared to last year due to revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings completed in '22, and in early '23 and from infrastructure mechanism filings. We continue to execute on our regulatory strategy, which continues to be the key driver of our results. Revenues in the second quarter were also higher due to increased usage from warm and unusually dry weather in several of our states. Tempering results were higher operating costs, which John will elaborate on further. Moving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023. We invested nearly $1.2 billion in capital projects year-to-date, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. Also, as you will recall, the total capital investment plan for 2023 includes approximately $400 million for acquisitions, including 2 sizable transactions we expect to close in the fourth quarter. Our outlook for future acquisitions remains strong as we have over $550 million of acquisitions under agreement, including those 2 sizable deals. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan. And as we announced last month, we completed a convertible debt issuance of just over $1 billion that achieved the other key element of our 2023 financing plan. Finally, earlier this week, we were pleased to publish our company's latest sustainability report. Cheryl will share a few highlights of the report, but at its core, it tells the story of how we are fulfilling our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service in a very sustainable way to American Water customers. And this has been our mission for over 135 years. Turning to Slide 6. We are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 per share to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. And once again, we are affirming our long-term targets. I continue to believe that our regulatory -- our strong regulatory financing and operational execution is the differentiator from our peers.  Our track record of executing on these fronts gives us confidence and should give investors confidence in our ability to achieve our short-term and our long-term financial targets. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently grow earnings and dividends at a top-tier pace over the next 5 years and beyond. And with that, I'll turn it over to John to cover some second quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John? Yes. Let me comment first and certainly, John can add to it. I think really it's -- you can look on the revenue side, primarily timing of rate cases and the resulting revenue increases and then also additional costs that we have built into those rate cases. We've been talking quite a bit about inflationary impacts and higher chemical costs and production costs, and we've been successful in getting those higher costs built into a number of the cases we did last year.

            "name": "John Griffith",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 8, I'll start by reviewing the successful completion of our 2023 financing plan. As Susan mentioned, and as I covered on the last call, earlier this year, we completed an upsized equity offering for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity is expected to be issued near the end of this 5-year plan, as we've previously communicated. Then last month, we issued just over $1 billion of exchangeable senior notes due in 2026 with an annual interest rate of 3.625%. As we previously disclosed, this exchangeable debt issuance supports our long-term growth as a diversified low-cost funding source that benefits customer affordability and shareholder value. Upon any exchange of the notes, the principal amount will be settled in cash with flexibility to settle any remaining value above the principal amount in cash, shares or a combination thereof at our election. We used the proceeds from both of these transactions to bring our commercial paper balance to zero by quarter end with almost $800 million of cash yet to be utilized, that is earning interest. With our 2023 long-term financing needs now complete, our balance sheet is well positioned to fund our robust water and wastewater investment growth. On Slide 9, we provide a summary of our continued strong financial condition, our total debt-to-capital ratio, net of cash on the balance sheet remains at 54% as of June 30, which is well below our target of 60%. We believe our current debt maturity levels in conjunction with future debt needs are very manageable. And I would remind you, as shown on this slide, of the $720 million of no proceeds that we will receive in 2026 from the sale of HOS completed in 2021. Our laddered approach to long-term debt financings over the years is important to manage cash flows and minimize interest rate risk. And finally, on liquidity, we remain confident that we will have sufficient access to capital for the foreseeable future. Turning to Slide 10. I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $1.44 per share for the quarter of $0.24 per share versus the same period in 2022, and up $0.17 per share on a weather-normalized basis. As you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we have made and continue to make in our systems. As noted, earnings were higher in the quarter by an estimated $0.07 per share due to weather in 2023 due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But we did see unusual weather in the quarter resulting in higher throughput, which we typically don't see during this time of year, our investments in resiliency and our proactive communications to customers around water conservation, ensured that we did not experience any significant operating issues during the quarter. And looking at operating costs, higher pension expense of about $0.04 per share and increased chemical costs of about $0.03 per share, including inflationary pressures were largely mitigated by the higher revenues. Based on the current outlook, we are not expecting the cost of chemicals to decrease in the near term as demand remains elevated. Our operating costs in the second quarter also increased due to a higher employee headcount to support growth in the business. As we've said, our proactive strategy last year to seek [rate] of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom-line impact of those higher costs in 2023. This approach continues in our recently filed cases. Supporting our investment growth, depreciation expense increased $0.06 per share and the cost of additional long-term financing increased $0.11 per share primarily related to share count dilution. As I mentioned last quarter, the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance offsets the avoided expense and the current interest rate environment. We expect the impact to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well based on the current outlook. Turning to Slide 11. Earnings increased $0.30 per share for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, earnings have increased $0.23 per share year-to-date, which, as Susan mentioned, is in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. Before we look at our expected full year 2023 EPS details, I should note that, as you would expect in the year of an equity issuance, our quarterly EPS results may not sum to equal the year-to-date EPS results each quarter. This is simply due to a different amount of average shares outstanding used in the EPS calculations as the year progresses. Turning to Slide 12. I'll echo Susan's comments that our results remain on track to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Here, we provide some updated details related to 2023 guidance that reflect results so far this year, including the completed 2023 financing plan. You can see, for example, that our implied revenue growth for the second half of the year will be strong, though somewhat less than the first half growth as new rates became effective in New Jersey last September. Looking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place, including our strengthened balance sheet to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today. Turning to Slide 13, you'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We closed on 10 acquisitions totaling $33 million across 5 states in the first half of 2023, which demonstrates our continued ability to close deals in many states. We also had 32 transactions under agreement across 10 states through the end of June totaling $555 million and includes both the Butler Area Sewer Authority, wastewater system in Pennsylvania, and the Granite City wastewater treatment plant in Illinois we previously announced. We now expect to close both of these transactions near the end of 2023 pending regulatory approvals for each.  Also included in our acquisitions under agreement is the Towamencin Township Wastewater System in Pennsylvania, we expect to purchase for $104 million as announced back in March. We continue to expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, pending regulatory approval, and we look forward to serving all of these customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. With our track record of closing on acquisitions and executing on our CapEx plans, we are confident that we will achieve our capital investment plan of $2.9 billion for 2023. And when you combine that with the financing we have already completed to fund growth, we believe our outlook for 2023 and beyond is very attractive for investors. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl? Yes, I think it does. That's right. Paul, we started to pick up New Jersey revenue last September, so that moderates year-over-year growth. And I'd say on from an inflation perspective, we're starting to see production costs moderate as we've come through the second quarter here. Yes. Paul, no real change there as we're thinking about it. As you know, we're raising financing in a periodic sort of manner. So we do expect to trend up over time until we reset again with equity, but no significant change there. Angie, I would just say on the financing piece that we set our plan last fall at a time when we can't predict interest rates. And I think where we've come out on the convert is consistent with our guidance and our affirmation of 2023."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the Company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin.\nAaron Musgrave : Thank you, Betsy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the first quarter earnings release and in March 31st Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and earnings per share. Susan Hardwick, our President and CEO, will share highlights of results, 2023 EPS guidance and longer-term target and proposed PFAS rule recently announced by the USCPA. John Griffith, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will cover our first quarter financial results in more detail, discuss our successful equity issuance and we'll close with an update on sizeable acquisitions announced so far this year. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our capital investment plan and active general rate cases and conclude with the few regulatory updates including details of the EPA\u2019s proposed PFAS rule. We will then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we're off to a good start in 2023 with strong financial results. As shown on slide 5, earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter compared to $0.87 per share last year. The increased results were as expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we're pleased to affirm. Here you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful upsized equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan. We also invested well over $500 million of capital in infrastructure in the quarter. In addition, we secured two large acquisitions so far this year, which puts us at over $550 million acquisitions under agreement. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value of quality service. The other significant news in the first quarter for us and the water industry as a whole came from the US Environmental Protection Agency when they released proposed national standards for PFAS. We support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability. We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the US water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges. Providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service to customers has been American Water's mission for over 130 years. We will continue to work cooperatively with the EPA and with Congress, regulators and policymakers in support of water quality standards that protect customers and communities balanced with affordability. Cheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS proposal and our response to it. But I want to assure our customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise and the will to tackle this issue head on and to advocate for reasonable policies and outcomes related to this very important topic. Turning to slide 6. As I mentioned, we are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share as well as our long term targets. We believe our strong regulatory and operational execution is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long term plans, growing earnings and dividends at a top tier pace over the next five years and beyond. Moving on to slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.6550 per share to $0.7075 per share, an 8% increase. We have grown our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 9.7% over the last five years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to many of our investors. And with that, let me turn it over to John to cover some first quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John?\nJohn Griffith: Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 9, I'll start by reviewing the equity issuance completed in March, really the first primary offering of meaningful size for American Water since 2009. As we've said, our plan was to issue in 2023 a significant portion of the $2 billion of expected equity needed in our current five year plan that goes through 2027. We were pleased to see very strong demand for the offering, which was upsized, and the greenshoe fully exercised for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity is expected to be issued near the end of this five year plan. We used the proceeds to bring our commercial paper balance down to zero by quarter end with a modest amount of cash left over. With the equity issuance, our balance sheet is fortified to fund our robust water and wastewater investment well into the future. Our total debt to capital ratio, which at year end was just above our target of 60% or less, has meaningfully to 54% as of quarter end. With our growth plan, this metric will rise somewhat over the next few years until we reset again as we receive in late 2026 the no proceeds from our sale of HOS and issue the remaining equity that is in our current five year plan. So to wrap up on equity, we believe the execution of this issuance is another indicator that the American Water investment thesis is strong, led by our compelling growth story and the leadership role we play in the utility sector. I'd like to take a moment to thank our treasury, legal, IR and many other teams at American Water, as well as our external advisors who worked diligently to prepare us to be ready to execute this transaction early in the year when the window of opportunity emerged. Turning our attention to slide 10, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2022. As you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we are making in our infrastructure, including the acceleration of spend made possible by the proceeds from the sales of New York American Water and Homeowner Services. As we've said consistently since the sales, it takes time to reinvest the sales proceeds and we are beginning to see those impacts. And looking at operating costs. higher pension expense of about $0.03per share and inflationary pressure on chemical, fuel and power costs of about $0.04 per share were largely mitigated by the higher revenues. Our proactive strategy last year to seek rate case recovery in many of our large jurisdictions of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023. As with the rate case we just filed in Indiana, we will be looking to recover higher operating costs in other jurisdictions over the next year though earning a full return on rate based investments and acquisitions continues to be the key driver of our general rate cases. Next, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and interest on additional long term debt increased $0.04 per share due to the $800 million senior note issuance from last May, both supporting our investment growth. Interest expense in the quarter also reflected about $0.04 per share from higher short term interest rates. I would also note that the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance was essentially neutral to EPS when considering the avoided interest cost in the first quarter by paying off commercial paper. We expect dilution from the higher share count net of avoided interest expense to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well. Finally, other net consists primarily of favorable post close adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2022 from the sale of HOS and additional earnings in 2023 from our new Military Services Group contract with Naval Station Mayport in Florida that we were awarded last summer. Turning to slide 11, you'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We had 27 transactions under agreement across nine states through the end of March, including the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania we previously announced, as well as the Towamencin Township wastewater system in Pennsylvania we are purchasing for $104 million as announced in March as part of an agreement to assume that asset purchase agreement from NextEra. Then just a few weeks ago, we were pleased to announce the purchase of the wastewater treatment plant in Granite City, Illinois for $83 million, which puts us at over $550 million of acquisitions under contract. We hope to close on Granite City by the end of 2023 and expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, both pending regulatory approvals, and we look forward to serving those customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous across our footprint. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. Before I turn it over to Cheryl, I'll echo Susan's comment that we're off to a very good start to the year. I'm confident in our ability to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. Looking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place, including our newly strengthened balance sheet, to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton : Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It required significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the dozens of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $100 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of capital investment spending in 2023. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts in timely recovery of these investments, you can see on slide 14 that we already have $279 million in annualized new revenues and rates since January of 2023. This includes $229 million from general rate cases and step increases and $50 million from infrastructure surcharges. We also have $144 million of total annualized revenue requests pending, including two infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Moving on to our regulatory strategy on slide 15, our theme here is around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs. We have consistently engaged with policymakers and regulators to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure and achieve timely recovery. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it levels out bill increases to our customers, making those bills more manageable. The pie chart on the right side of the page also speaks to timely recovery of our investments across our footprint. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we can reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This enables us not only to earn our allowed return, but also to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers. We expect about 75% of capital investment over the next five years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms and through the use of forward test years, which is the key to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term. The ability to execute our regulatory strategies is a critical success factor for continuing to grow our business each year. As water and wastewater industry challenges grow, we'll continue to focus on constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes to help us work through those challenges. Let's go to slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on this slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges, as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate cases in our top ten states. At the end of March, we filed a general rate case in Indiana, reflecting $875 million in water and wastewater system and investments to be made through 2025 to continue providing safe and reliable service. The revenue request also includes an increase in the cost of chemicals and other operating costs that we continue to see. We are seeking to increase revenues over a phased three step process through May 2025 that would result in $87 million of additional annual revenue when fully implemented. In California, our case was filed in July of last year and is progressing as expected so far. We're seeking increased revenues of approximately $95 million over a phased three step process, with rate changes expected to be effective in 2024, 2025 and 2026. We're also still awaiting a ruling from the Commission on the pending cost of capital case. In Missouri, on March 3rd, we were pleased to file a settlement agreement with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The settlement reflects an increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges. A final decision on this matter is expected in the second quarter of 2023. And finally, earlier this week, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the settlement of our rate request, authorizing a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $11 million. Outside of general rate cases, there were a few notable developments since our fourth quarter 2022 call. In California related to the Monterey Water supply project, we signed the Pure Water Monterey expansion agreement following an order issued by the CPUC. We are now allowed to standard ratemaking treatment for the construction funding of the pumps and pipes that were built to support the expansion. Together with the desalination and water reuse projects and process and aquifer storage and recovery online, we believe that a secure water future for the Monterey Peninsula is now possible once the approval process is complete. On the legislative front in Indiana, Senate Bill 180 passed the State House and Senate with bipartisan support and is awaiting the governor's signature where it will become effective immediately. This bill allows for consolidated rates in wastewater systems through Indiana's service enhancement Improvement recovery mechanism. Turning to PFAS, I'll expand on Susan's earlier comments on EPA's proposed rulemaking. While American Water has long been anticipating and preparing for the rulemaking, our initial analyses were primarily based on a federal PFAS standard that would be more in line with the higher treatment limits set by several states. We are carefully reviewing the EPA's proposed drinking water regulation to assess the four parts per trillion limits for PFOA and PFOS, and the application of the hazard index approach for several other chemicals. Our review will assess impacts to our capital and operating expense plan as well as our needed financing. It's logical to assume that the significantly lower treatment level, the number of facilities that will require treatment will be larger, as will the cost. One of our early concerns is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated. Our analysis continues, and upon completion of our preliminary assessment, we'll submit comments on the proposal to the EPA by May 30. As the EPA develops its final rule, which is expected by the end of 2023, we'll have more information to share based upon further review and analysis. To be very clear, though, American Water joins other water organizations in support of the EPA, Congress and other decision makers in implementing reasonable policies aimed at keep harmful PFAS out of drinking water supplies and communities. In addition to the comments we intend to provide on the proposed rule itself, we also expect to provide comments to the EPA and others on many related issues, including the following. We'll ask for an exemption of water and wastewater systems from financial liability for PFAS under USCPA. We'll also ask to ensure all water and wastewater utility providers, regardless of ownership, have equal access to any and all federal and/or state funding related to treating PFAS. In addition, we'll request permanent federal funding for a water and wastewater low income customer assistance program. Providing safe, reliable and affordable water is American Water's business. We'll continue to work productively with the EPA, Congress, regulators, and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protect customers, communities, and the general public. So with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you might have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning, and thank you for the time today. Appreciate all the commentary on the PFAS side, but just want to dig in there a little bit more. Any way to frame the magnitude of capital versus O&M that's particularly levered to an outcome here? At a minimum, is this more of a capital opportunity than an expense concern, or you're kind of flagging both as potential impacts to rates on a go forward basis?\nSusan Hardwick: Hey. Good morning, Rich. Yes, it's a great question. Obviously, as Cheryl indicated, we have a lot of analysis to do with this proposed rule at these treatment limits that are proposed. And, you know Rich, how this works. I mean, there's a process to be worked here in terms of comments and feedback to the EPA about the proposed rule. And as Cheryl said, obviously we're quite supportive of what they're trying to accomplish here. And in fact, even at the four parts per trillion, we don't have huge issue with that. I think the issue is around cost. As Cheryl said, our early expectations here are that the EPA estimates around costs are understated. So I think that'll be part of the response that the industry generally provides back to the EPA. For us, as I said and Cheryl said, we're continuing to evaluate the impacts. And as you know, we've talked about this many times, we use a risk based approach to our capital planning. So as we work these projects into our capital plan, it could very well change that risk profile and move other projects out. So as we think about changes to our overall plan, we still got a lot of work to do to determine that. Specific to your question, though, around capital versus O&M, we think there's a fair amount of both that will be necessary at this level. So there'll be capital requirements to have facilities that are able to facilitate the treatment, and then, of course, there'll be an ongoing operating cost associated with the treatment itself. So lots to be learned yet on this and again, direct impacts to our plan yet to be determined.\nRichard Sunderland: Okay, understood. That's very helpful context. I guess sticking with the cost side, we spent a lot of time last year discussing chemicals costs, and it came up in the walk this year in terms of the rate recovery of those higher costs. Can you speak a little bit more to the recent trends you're seeing there and maybe bridge that back to your expectations last fall when you laid out the latest plan. How do you think about these expenses impacting customer bills over the next few years?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, Rich, good question. And Cheryl and John certainly can weigh in on this, too. But we have seen, I'd say, a continuation of the impacts that we started seeing really in the second quarter of last year. While some of the increases in certain costs may have started to level out a bit, they still are all elevated, and we expect that to continue for some time. I think the real key here and you touched on it, is the work we did in the regulatory arena to address these costs early on. And we've estimated that roughly 75% of the costs we'll experience in \u201823, we've got fully baked into rates as a result of those cases we did last year. And as Cheryl mentioned, or maybe John did in the prepared remarks in the Indiana case we just filed, we've addressed it there, too. So we think we have done as good a job as could be done to address these costs early on so that they don't have bottom line impact. But we continue to see a fair amount of pressure here on the cost side.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So first maybe like the presentation question. So you no longer show us the breakdown of earnings by segment, right, with no bridge for regulated earnings, market based and corporate? Can you give us this breakdown for the quarter?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, I think the waterfall that you have there probably is as good as there is. The impact from the market based business, which is now just military, is very small and on a year-over-year basis, just not much of a variation. The other segment, I think we highlighted the primary driver there, which would have been the gain, the sort of true-up gain on the HOS sale in the first quarter of last year.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. I mean I tried to actually imply from the 10-Q and I couldn't. But anyway, okay, moving on to you didn't mention the weather as a factor in earnings. And that's I think something that we've seen on the electric side and a couple of your water peers have also highlighted as a drag on the quarter. Was that a driver at all?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. First quarter for us is not much of a weather impact year. Cheryl, you want to just talk about seasonality or \u2013\nCheryl Norton : Yes. Our biggest weather impacts are going to be in second and third quarter. Sometimes it will spill over into the fourth quarter, typically the first quarter, unless the weather is really, really severe in one direction or another. We won't see any weather impact at all. And this year, I think the weather was not that dramatic for us to see that impact. So I think we're pretty solid.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then lastly, I noticed that you are pursuing an appeal of that denial of the acquisition adjustment related to the Shorelands acquisition. It looks like a decision will be issued sometime in 2023. So can you, again, I haven't followed it closely, but can you give us a sense of, is this still a long shot? I mean, how important is it for any future growth aspirations you might have? And I know that transaction itself is only $29 million, so that's not that big a deal as far as the goodwill impact. But again, any implications related to this pending case?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, really no implications of any materiality, but Cheryl, you want to comment on status here?\nCheryl Norton : Yes. Angie, yes. The issue is still kind of hanging out there, but there's going to be no real impact to us from a financial perspective. And in all honesty, we found other ways of doing deals so that we're not so worried about the precedents that this decision sets for us. We still believe, like, we have a strong case, but in the grand scheme of things, it really has little to no impact.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then just going back to PFAS, I'm sorry. So I looked at these rules, pretty strict requirements with penalties. Then again, I think that the problem we've seen over the last, I think, couple of decades is that EPA hasn't been really imposing those penalties or really going after the systems that have been non-compliant with the regulations. So I'm just wondering if, how big a difference would there be with this one as far as, for example, your municipal grow, municipal M&A or any sort of additional pressure that should exert on privately or municipally owned systems? Again, because EPA hasn't been particularly diligent in imposing other rules.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, I think it's a fair observation, Angie, and it's obviously one of the things that we'll address in our comments. We think that these rules should apply, obviously, to all providers and that EPA should use its authority to enforce the rules. There is a track record here, so we'll have to, again, sort of comment on that. As it relates to our views on acquisition potential. John, you want to comment on that? We think there could be some opportunity, but I think you've hit on the key issue.\nJohn Griffith: Yes, Angie. I just say that we look at this issue as another reason on the list for why municipals may choose to sell to us in the future.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo with Bank of America.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning, team. And congrats on the successful equity offering. Just curious, did you consider placing the full bill $2 billion of equity for the whole plan to just take it out of the way given the strong demand? And I believe I heard you say that you expect the equity offering to be EPS neutral on full year 2023 versus plan. Was that correct?\nSusan Hardwick: John, you want to comment here?\nJohn Griffith: Sure, yes. On the first part of the question, we tried to remain consistent with the messaging that we had provided to investors in the past. So as we thought about the magnitude of the issuance, we wanted to stay within that range and we did so. With regards to dilution, that's correct. We expect that just given our ability to pay off debt and with where interest rates are, and given how we trade from a valuation perspective, we look at the issuances as EPS neutral.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay, great, then switching topics. I noticed that Indiana legislation as well. Does that influence higher any of the prospective capital or acquisition priorities in the state?\nSusan Hardwick: John, you want to comment on that? Yes, the question really, Paul, is around this consolidated rate issue, that legislation you're referring to.\nPaul Zimbardo: And the additional mechanism from the new legislation that was enacted, it seems like it could help reduce regulatory lag perspectively.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, I think that's probably fair, and I do think it probably creates opportunity around acquisitions. Again, I think it gives us more leverage to grow in Indiana and have used that consolidated revenue mechanism to lessen the bill impact on customers. I think it's a very important piece of legislation from that perspective to, again, sort of facilitate growth.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS.\nGregg Orrill: Yes, thank you. Congratulations. Good morning. I was wondering if I could ask your view on sort of Florida as a market for acquisitions. I think there's legislation that's progressing there on fair value and then just how you're thinking about the pursuit of litigation regarding the PFAS rules to help pay and sort of how that would get folded in versus the timeline for compliance. Thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Well, those are two big topics, Gregg. First, maybe on Florida, let me just comment there. I think and obviously we're following developments there, as we do sort of across the nation around legislative actions, regulatory actions, et cetera. But I'd say our answer is the same as it always is on potential growth into other states. We really have to see an opportunity to grow substantially in a particular state. We look at regulatory environment, legislative environment, those types of things. And we're constantly looking at opportunities. But all of the parts have to sort of come together, I think, for us to do anything significant beyond our existing footprint, which, of course, we like a lot. We think we have optimized our footprint. We like the environments that we're in. We have great opportunities for growth in our existing jurisdictions. And obviously, that's where our focus continues to be. On your second question around PFAS and litigation and impacts there, as Cheryl mentioned, there is litigation and has been for some time around this. And our goal here, I think the industry's goal, is to while we feel responsible for helping to solve the problem and we are best positioned to do the treatment, we do think it's important that those that are responsible for the production of the chemicals also be held responsible. So our states are actively involved in that litigation and will continue to be. And we do think that's an important part of this overall equation that has to be worked through. And again, customer affordability is at the heart of that. We don't think it's necessary or appropriate for customers to pay for things that they really aren't responsible for. So we'll be actively pursuing that litigation along with the rest of the industry.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Jonathan Reader with Wells Fargo.\nJonathan Reader: Hey, good morning, team. I just wanted to build a little bit on Angie's earlier question just regarding kind of the segment breakdown a little bit. Can you give us some directional guidance? I don't think your full year was exactly broken out by the two segments and with kind of other being recast to include what's left of market based and the other historical parent and other segment, I think full year 2022 was $0.19 from that segment, but that included I think it was a $19 million pretax gain. So how should we be thinking about, I guess full year \u201823 kind of overall drag there?\nSusan Hardwick: Boy, Jonathan, we're going to have to go back and look at those numbers. Those numbers don't sound right to me for the prior year, we had some true-up activity related to the HOS sale, and maybe that's getting confused a bit here, but all that's remaining is our military services group and the earnings year-over-year really not much of a variance, and it's a relatively small part of the overall earnings contribution anyway. But we can follow back up on that reconciliation the numbers that you're quoting, because, again, I don't think that's reflective of the size of the business.\nJonathan Reader: Okay. But, I mean, it sounds like if we just strip out maybe that $19 million pretax true-up gain or whatever, that you're kind of thinking the other part of the business is kind of flattish when we look at it from \u201822 to \u201823.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Certainly the military services group operations year-over-year relatively flat. We'll need to verify that $19 million pretax number you're quoting there. That doesn't ring a bell to me. I mean, I know there's a number there. I just don't recall it being that. So we'll have Aaron follow back up with you on that just to make sure we got the right numbers there.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and concludes the conference call.

            "content": "Thanks John, and good morning, everyone. Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter executing on our increased capital plan. It required significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the dozens of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by nearly $100 million in the quarter compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $2.9 billion of capital investment spending in 2023. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts in timely recovery of these investments, you can see on slide 14 that we already have $279 million in annualized new revenues and rates since January of 2023. This includes $229 million from general rate cases and step increases and $50 million from infrastructure surcharges. We also have $144 million of total annualized revenue requests pending, including two infrastructure surcharge proceedings. Moving on to our regulatory strategy on slide 15, our theme here is around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs. We have consistently engaged with policymakers and regulators to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure and achieve timely recovery. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it levels out bill increases to our customers, making those bills more manageable. The pie chart on the right side of the page also speaks to timely recovery of our investments across our footprint. Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we can reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This enables us not only to earn our allowed return, but also to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers. We expect about 75% of capital investment over the next five years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms and through the use of forward test years, which is the key to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term. The ability to execute our regulatory strategies is a critical success factor for continuing to grow our business each year. As water and wastewater industry challenges grow, we'll continue to focus on constructive regulatory and legislative outcomes to help us work through those challenges. Let's go to slide 16 and cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. Shown on this slide is a summary of our pending general rate cases with some key facts for each. In the appendix, you'll also find some details related to infrastructure charges, as well as a snapshot of the key outcomes from the most recent general rate cases in our top ten states. At the end of March, we filed a general rate case in Indiana, reflecting $875 million in water and wastewater system and investments to be made through 2025 to continue providing safe and reliable service. The revenue request also includes an increase in the cost of chemicals and other operating costs that we continue to see. We are seeking to increase revenues over a phased three step process through May 2025 that would result in $87 million of additional annual revenue when fully implemented. In California, our case was filed in July of last year and is progressing as expected so far. We're seeking increased revenues of approximately $95 million over a phased three step process, with rate changes expected to be effective in 2024, 2025 and 2026. We're also still awaiting a ruling from the Commission on the pending cost of capital case. In Missouri, on March 3rd, we were pleased to file a settlement agreement with the Missouri Public Service Commission. The settlement reflects an increase of $95 million in annualized revenues, including $51 million for previously approved infrastructure surcharges. A final decision on this matter is expected in the second quarter of 2023. And finally, earlier this week, the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved the settlement of our rate request, authorizing a total annualized revenue increase of approximately $11 million. Outside of general rate cases, there were a few notable developments since our fourth quarter 2022 call. In California related to the Monterey Water supply project, we signed the Pure Water Monterey expansion agreement following an order issued by the CPUC. We are now allowed to standard ratemaking treatment for the construction funding of the pumps and pipes that were built to support the expansion. Together with the desalination and water reuse projects and process and aquifer storage and recovery online, we believe that a secure water future for the Monterey Peninsula is now possible once the approval process is complete. On the legislative front in Indiana, Senate Bill 180 passed the State House and Senate with bipartisan support and is awaiting the governor's signature where it will become effective immediately. This bill allows for consolidated rates in wastewater systems through Indiana's service enhancement Improvement recovery mechanism. Turning to PFAS, I'll expand on Susan's earlier comments on EPA's proposed rulemaking. While American Water has long been anticipating and preparing for the rulemaking, our initial analyses were primarily based on a federal PFAS standard that would be more in line with the higher treatment limits set by several states. We are carefully reviewing the EPA's proposed drinking water regulation to assess the four parts per trillion limits for PFOA and PFOS, and the application of the hazard index approach for several other chemicals. Our review will assess impacts to our capital and operating expense plan as well as our needed financing. It's logical to assume that the significantly lower treatment level, the number of facilities that will require treatment will be larger, as will the cost. One of our early concerns is that EPA's cost estimates are materially understated. Our analysis continues, and upon completion of our preliminary assessment, we'll submit comments on the proposal to the EPA by May 30. As the EPA develops its final rule, which is expected by the end of 2023, we'll have more information to share based upon further review and analysis. To be very clear, though, American Water joins other water organizations in support of the EPA, Congress and other decision makers in implementing reasonable policies aimed at keep harmful PFAS out of drinking water supplies and communities. In addition to the comments we intend to provide on the proposed rule itself, we also expect to provide comments to the EPA and others on many related issues, including the following. We'll ask for an exemption of water and wastewater systems from financial liability for PFAS under USCPA. We'll also ask to ensure all water and wastewater utility providers, regardless of ownership, have equal access to any and all federal and/or state funding related to treating PFAS. In addition, we'll request permanent federal funding for a water and wastewater low income customer assistance program. Providing safe, reliable and affordable water is American Water's business. We'll continue to work productively with the EPA, Congress, regulators, and policymakers to ensure that the implementation of any final standards protect customers, communities, and the general public. So with that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you might have. Yes. Our biggest weather impacts are going to be in second and third quarter. Sometimes it will spill over into the fourth quarter, typically the first quarter, unless the weather is really, really severe in one direction or another. We won't see any weather impact at all. And this year, I think the weather was not that dramatic for us to see that impact. So I think we're pretty solid. Yes. Angie, yes. The issue is still kind of hanging out there, but there's going to be no real impact to us from a financial perspective. And in all honesty, we found other ways of doing deals so that we're not so worried about the precedents that this decision sets for us. We still believe, like, we have a strong case, but in the grand scheme of things, it really has little to no impact."

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we're off to a good start in 2023 with strong financial results. As shown on slide 5, earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter compared to $0.87 per share last year. The increased results were as expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we're pleased to affirm. Here you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2023, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks. As we announced in March, we completed a very successful upsized equity issuance of $1.7 billion of American Water common stock. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2023 financing plan. We also invested well over $500 million of capital in infrastructure in the quarter. In addition, we secured two large acquisitions so far this year, which puts us at over $550 million acquisitions under agreement. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value of quality service. The other significant news in the first quarter for us and the water industry as a whole came from the US Environmental Protection Agency when they released proposed national standards for PFAS. We support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability. We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the US water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges. Providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service to customers has been American Water's mission for over 130 years. We will continue to work cooperatively with the EPA and with Congress, regulators and policymakers in support of water quality standards that protect customers and communities balanced with affordability. Cheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS proposal and our response to it. But I want to assure our customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise and the will to tackle this issue head on and to advocate for reasonable policies and outcomes related to this very important topic. Turning to slide 6. As I mentioned, we are affirming our 2023 EPS guidance range of $4.72 to $4.82 per share as well as our long term targets. We believe our strong regulatory and operational execution is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long term plans, growing earnings and dividends at a top tier pace over the next five years and beyond. Moving on to slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors increased the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.6550 per share to $0.7075 per share, an 8% increase. We have grown our dividend at a compounded annual growth rate of 9.7% over the last five years, significantly outpacing most of our utility peers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to many of our investors. And with that, let me turn it over to John to cover some first quarter highlights and financial results in more detail. John? Hey. Good morning, Rich. Yes, it's a great question. Obviously, as Cheryl indicated, we have a lot of analysis to do with this proposed rule at these treatment limits that are proposed. And, you know Rich, how this works. I mean, there's a process to be worked here in terms of comments and feedback to the EPA about the proposed rule. And as Cheryl said, obviously we're quite supportive of what they're trying to accomplish here. And in fact, even at the four parts per trillion, we don't have huge issue with that. I think the issue is around cost. As Cheryl said, our early expectations here are that the EPA estimates around costs are understated. So I think that'll be part of the response that the industry generally provides back to the EPA. For us, as I said and Cheryl said, we're continuing to evaluate the impacts. And as you know, we've talked about this many times, we use a risk based approach to our capital planning. So as we work these projects into our capital plan, it could very well change that risk profile and move other projects out. So as we think about changes to our overall plan, we still got a lot of work to do to determine that. Specific to your question, though, around capital versus O&M, we think there's a fair amount of both that will be necessary at this level. So there'll be capital requirements to have facilities that are able to facilitate the treatment, and then, of course, there'll be an ongoing operating cost associated with the treatment itself. So lots to be learned yet on this and again, direct impacts to our plan yet to be determined. Yes, Rich, good question. And Cheryl and John certainly can weigh in on this, too. But we have seen, I'd say, a continuation of the impacts that we started seeing really in the second quarter of last year. While some of the increases in certain costs may have started to level out a bit, they still are all elevated, and we expect that to continue for some time. I think the real key here and you touched on it, is the work we did in the regulatory arena to address these costs early on. And we've estimated that roughly 75% of the costs we'll experience in \u201823, we've got fully baked into rates as a result of those cases we did last year. And as Cheryl mentioned, or maybe John did in the prepared remarks in the Indiana case we just filed, we've addressed it there, too. So we think we have done as good a job as could be done to address these costs early on so that they don't have bottom line impact. But we continue to see a fair amount of pressure here on the cost side. Well, I think the waterfall that you have there probably is as good as there is. The impact from the market based business, which is now just military, is very small and on a year-over-year basis, just not much of a variation. The other segment, I think we highlighted the primary driver there, which would have been the gain, the sort of true-up gain on the HOS sale in the first quarter of last year. Yes. First quarter for us is not much of a weather impact year. Cheryl, you want to just talk about seasonality or \u2013 Yes, really no implications of any materiality, but Cheryl, you want to comment on status here? Yes, I think it's a fair observation, Angie, and it's obviously one of the things that we'll address in our comments. We think that these rules should apply, obviously, to all providers and that EPA should use its authority to enforce the rules. There is a track record here, so we'll have to, again, sort of comment on that. As it relates to our views on acquisition potential. John, you want to comment on that? We think there could be some opportunity, but I think you've hit on the key issue. John, you want to comment here? John, you want to comment on that? Yes, the question really, Paul, is around this consolidated rate issue, that legislation you're referring to. Yes, I think that's probably fair, and I do think it probably creates opportunity around acquisitions. Again, I think it gives us more leverage to grow in Indiana and have used that consolidated revenue mechanism to lessen the bill impact on customers. I think it's a very important piece of legislation from that perspective to, again, sort of facilitate growth. Well, those are two big topics, Gregg. First, maybe on Florida, let me just comment there. I think and obviously we're following developments there, as we do sort of across the nation around legislative actions, regulatory actions, et cetera. But I'd say our answer is the same as it always is on potential growth into other states. We really have to see an opportunity to grow substantially in a particular state. We look at regulatory environment, legislative environment, those types of things. And we're constantly looking at opportunities. But all of the parts have to sort of come together, I think, for us to do anything significant beyond our existing footprint, which, of course, we like a lot. We think we have optimized our footprint. We like the environments that we're in. We have great opportunities for growth in our existing jurisdictions. And obviously, that's where our focus continues to be. On your second question around PFAS and litigation and impacts there, as Cheryl mentioned, there is litigation and has been for some time around this. And our goal here, I think the industry's goal, is to while we feel responsible for helping to solve the problem and we are best positioned to do the treatment, we do think it's important that those that are responsible for the production of the chemicals also be held responsible. So our states are actively involved in that litigation and will continue to be. And we do think that's an important part of this overall equation that has to be worked through. And again, customer affordability is at the heart of that. We don't think it's necessary or appropriate for customers to pay for things that they really aren't responsible for. So we'll be actively pursuing that litigation along with the rest of the industry. Boy, Jonathan, we're going to have to go back and look at those numbers. Those numbers don't sound right to me for the prior year, we had some true-up activity related to the HOS sale, and maybe that's getting confused a bit here, but all that's remaining is our military services group and the earnings year-over-year really not much of a variance, and it's a relatively small part of the overall earnings contribution anyway. But we can follow back up on that reconciliation the numbers that you're quoting, because, again, I don't think that's reflective of the size of the business. Yes. Certainly the military services group operations year-over-year relatively flat. We'll need to verify that $19 million pretax number you're quoting there. That doesn't ring a bell to me. I mean, I know there's a number there. I just don't recall it being that. So we'll have Aaron follow back up with you on that just to make sure we got the right numbers there."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "John Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 9, I'll start by reviewing the equity issuance completed in March, really the first primary offering of meaningful size for American Water since 2009. As we've said, our plan was to issue in 2023 a significant portion of the $2 billion of expected equity needed in our current five year plan that goes through 2027. We were pleased to see very strong demand for the offering, which was upsized, and the greenshoe fully exercised for proceeds of $1.7 billion. The remaining portion of the $2 billion of our currently planned equity is expected to be issued near the end of this five year plan. We used the proceeds to bring our commercial paper balance down to zero by quarter end with a modest amount of cash left over. With the equity issuance, our balance sheet is fortified to fund our robust water and wastewater investment well into the future. Our total debt to capital ratio, which at year end was just above our target of 60% or less, has meaningfully to 54% as of quarter end. With our growth plan, this metric will rise somewhat over the next few years until we reset again as we receive in late 2026 the no proceeds from our sale of HOS and issue the remaining equity that is in our current five year plan. So to wrap up on equity, we believe the execution of this issuance is another indicator that the American Water investment thesis is strong, led by our compelling growth story and the leadership role we play in the utility sector. I'd like to take a moment to thank our treasury, legal, IR and many other teams at American Water, as well as our external advisors who worked diligently to prepare us to be ready to execute this transaction early in the year when the window of opportunity emerged. Turning our attention to slide 10, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter earnings were $0.91 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2022. As you know, we have completed rate cases recently in our larger states and are seeing the increased revenues as a result. These additional revenues are driven by the significant investments we are making in our infrastructure, including the acceleration of spend made possible by the proceeds from the sales of New York American Water and Homeowner Services. As we've said consistently since the sales, it takes time to reinvest the sales proceeds and we are beginning to see those impacts. And looking at operating costs. higher pension expense of about $0.03per share and inflationary pressure on chemical, fuel and power costs of about $0.04 per share were largely mitigated by the higher revenues. Our proactive strategy last year to seek rate case recovery in many of our large jurisdictions of rising production costs and expected higher pension costs has positioned us favorably to limit the bottom line impact of those higher costs in 2023. As with the rate case we just filed in Indiana, we will be looking to recover higher operating costs in other jurisdictions over the next year though earning a full return on rate based investments and acquisitions continues to be the key driver of our general rate cases. Next, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and interest on additional long term debt increased $0.04 per share due to the $800 million senior note issuance from last May, both supporting our investment growth. Interest expense in the quarter also reflected about $0.04 per share from higher short term interest rates. I would also note that the EPS impact of the higher share count from our equity issuance was essentially neutral to EPS when considering the avoided interest cost in the first quarter by paying off commercial paper. We expect dilution from the higher share count net of avoided interest expense to be approximately neutral to EPS for the full year as well. Finally, other net consists primarily of favorable post close adjustments recorded in the first quarter of 2022 from the sale of HOS and additional earnings in 2023 from our new Military Services Group contract with Naval Station Mayport in Florida that we were awarded last summer. Turning to slide 11, you'll see that we are set up for strong growth through acquisitions in 2023 and beyond. We had 27 transactions under agreement across nine states through the end of March, including the Butler Area Sewer Authority wastewater system in Pennsylvania we previously announced, as well as the Towamencin Township wastewater system in Pennsylvania we are purchasing for $104 million as announced in March as part of an agreement to assume that asset purchase agreement from NextEra. Then just a few weeks ago, we were pleased to announce the purchase of the wastewater treatment plant in Granite City, Illinois for $83 million, which puts us at over $550 million of acquisitions under contract. We hope to close on Granite City by the end of 2023 and expect to close on Towamencin by midyear 2024, both pending regulatory approvals, and we look forward to serving those customers. Of course, as we close on transactions, the work to build and refill the acquisition pipeline is continuous across our footprint. Our pipeline of over 1.3 million customer connections is a strong leading indicator that supports this piece of our earnings growth triangle. Before I turn it over to Cheryl, I'll echo Susan's comment that we're off to a very good start to the year. I'm confident in our ability to achieve our 2023 EPS guidance of $4.72 to $4.82 per share. Looking ahead, I am pleased that we have the right fundamentals in place, including our newly strengthened balance sheet, to achieve our long-term financial targets, which we are also affirming today. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our capital investment, rate case and other regulatory updates. Cheryl? Yes, Angie. I just say that we look at this issue as another reason on the list for why municipals may choose to sell to us in the future. Sure, yes. On the first part of the question, we tried to remain consistent with the messaging that we had provided to investors in the past. So as we thought about the magnitude of the issuance, we wanted to stay within that range and we did so. With regards to dilution, that's correct. We expect that just given our ability to pay off debt and with where interest rates are, and given how we trade from a valuation perspective, we look at the issuances as EPS neutral."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations Website. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some Safe Harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the third quarter earnings release and in our September 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. John Griffith, our President, will share highlights of third quarter and year-to-date results and will comment on our 2025 EPS guidance and longer-term targets. David Bowler, our Executive Vice President and CFO, will discuss our year-to-date financial results in more detail, general rate case updates, our 2025 outlook and our 5-year financing plan. Cheryl Norton, our Executive Vice President and COO, will then discuss our new capital investment plan, including the expected impact of EPA's lead and copper rule improvements, and we'll conclude with comments on customer affordability and our acquisition outlook. Susan Hardwick, our CEO, will conclude with a look at our compelling investment thesis. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President, John Griffith.\nJohn Griffith: Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how happy we are to have David in the role of CFO, after having served as our Deputy CFO and Treasurer. You'll hear more from David shortly. And likewise, as we noted last quarter, I'm pleased to hand the business development baton to Cheryl, whose oversight of our state presidents and her role as Chief Operating Officer is key to our business development activities as we continue to drive enhanced focus on origination activities at the state level. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights from the third quarter and year-to-date periods. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, in line with our expectations, adding to an already strong 2024. Earnings were $1.80 per share for the quarter compared to $1.66 for the same period last year. In the first nine months of 2024, earnings were $4.17 per share compared to $4.03 for the same period last year. Our results reflect the clear execution of our plan in 2024, which David and Cheryl will discuss further. These results give us confidence to affirm our 2024 EPS guidance of $5.25 to $5.30 per share, which, as you'll recall from last quarter, represents our narrowing of guidance to the top half of the previous guidance range. As a reminder, our 2024 and 2025 EPS guidance ranges include $0.10 per share of incremental interest income from the amendment of the HOS note earlier this year, which is on top of the interest income from the original note terms that we are replacing with earnings from the regulated business. As we've said in the past, repayment of the note is a component of our long-term financing plan as a source of funding for our growth. I also want to highlight that just a few days ago, we closed the $230 million acquisition of the Wastewater System Assets of Butler Area Sewer Authority in Pennsylvania. Our Pennsylvania team assisted by the corporate business development team worked hard to complete this deal, which adds 15,000 customers who we are pleased to begin serving. Turning to Slide 6. We are initiating our 2025 earnings guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 per share. This represents 8% EPS growth in 2025 compared to our weather-normalized 2024 EPS guidance, which David will discuss in further detail. As we roll out our updated 5-year plan today, we are affirming our long-term targets, including 7% to 9% EPS and dividend compounded annual growth rates. As a regulated water and wastewater utility, rate base growth, regulatory and capital execution and operational excellence are the key drivers of growth for our company. We expect to achieve 8% to 9% rate base growth over the next decade, driven by the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth 3 years ago to meet reliability, resiliency and compliance needs. Our rate base growth includes our regulated acquisition strategy, which drives a growing customer base, as well as the organic revenue growth opportunities we expect from our military services group. Along with our affordability and sustainability leadership, we believe these are the drivers of American Water's very competitive and sustainable shareholder return. In today's closing remarks, Susan will share her thoughts on our position as a premium regulated utility. In closing, on Slide 7, I want to emphasize that we expect to achieve consistent EPS growth within the 7% to 9% range through 2029 and beyond. We are demonstrating in 2024 and with our guidance for 2025 that the business plan we set forth following the sale of HOS is strong and compelling. Our commitment to solving problems for our customers remains steadfast, including addressing PFAS, letting copper and aging infrastructure, among other challenges. No other water and wastewater utility has the combination of the scale, geographic diversity and expertise that we have. This foundation, coupled with the capital investment needs in our industry uniquely positions American Water to achieve consistently strong earnings growth for many years to come. One final note, before I turn it over to David. As you know, earlier this month, we notified stakeholders of unauthorized activity within our computer networks and systems, which we determined to be the result of a cybersecurity incident. Importantly, none of the company's water or wastewater facilities were impacted by this incident. While the investigation of the incident by a dedicated team of professionals is ongoing, we do not expect that this incident will have a material effect on the company or its financial condition or results of operations. With that, I'll hand it over to David to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. David?\nDavid Bowler: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started with results, let me first say how excited I am to assume the role of CFO at American Water and continue my work with this great team. I also look forward to meeting many of you at EEI in a couple of weeks. Turning to slide 9. Let me provide a few more details on year-to-date results. Consolidated earnings were $4.17 per share, up $0.14 per share compared to the same period in 2023 and up $0.18 per share on a weather-normalized basis. As noted, earnings in 2024 were higher by an estimated $0.07 per share as a result of weather in the second and third quarters as compared to $0.11 per share of favorable weather in the second and third quarters of 2023. Excluding the impacts of weather, revenues increased by $0.84 per share, driven primarily by general rate case outcomes in 2023 and thus far in 2024. And looking at operating costs, O&M was higher by $0.19 per share, driven primarily by employee-related costs and other increases to support growth in the business as we expected. Production costs related to fuel, power and chemicals were also slightly higher compared to this period in 2023. Next, general taxes, which are comprised of property and gross receipts taxes were higher by $0.06 per share with the increase in property tax tied to the level of capital investment and higher gross receipts tax driven by higher revenue, primarily in New Jersey. Depreciation increased $0.21 per share and long-term financing costs increased $0.28 per share both as expected in support of our investment growth. The higher long-term financing cost includes interest on the $1 billion convertible note issuance from last June, the $1.4 billion senior note issuance in this February as well as $0.07 of dilution from last year's equity issuance. And finally, we had $0.07 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of Homeowner Services. As we've stated, we will continue to break this out quarterly so investors can track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy without this additional interest income. I will also note in the appendix, you will find details on the third quarter EPS, which has many of the same drivers as the year-to-date results. On slide 10, I will review the latest regulatory activity in our states. First, on completed cases. We received an order from the New Jersey Commission in September approving without modification, our settlement agreement of an additional $80 million in annualized revenues that was effective September 15. The commission again approved an allowed return on equity of 9.6% and an equity layer of 55%. New Jersey continues to be a constructive state that is supportive of investment to serve our customers well. Turning to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in seven jurisdictions. These cases are centered around the capital investments we have made and will continue to make in these states. In Missouri, we originally filed a rate case with a proposal for a full future test year, which the commission declined to accept at this time. However, the commission provided an allowance for discrete adjustments that recognize investments through May 2025. While not the ruling we wanted in this case, we are encouraged by the conversations we've had with the commission and are continuing to work on a legislative path for a future test year in Missouri. Otherwise, our case in Missouri is progressing as expected. In Illinois, we received a proposed decision from the administrative law judge on October 24, recommending a 9.84% return on equity and a 49% equity layer. A final order in this case is expected no later than December 17 with new rates implemented January 1, 2025. In Virginia, on September 20, we filed a black box settlement with the Virginia Commission, which agreed to a $15 million annualized increase in revenues compared to our ask of $20 million. The settlement stipulation also specified a return on equity of 9.7%, which matches the current allowed return and a capital structure with an equity component of 45.67%, which compares to the current approved cap structure of 40.73%. The settlement remains subject to commission review and approval. In California, we expect the final rate case decision on December 5 with new rates retroactive to January 1, 2024. As a reminder, we reached a partial settlement agreement in November 2023 with the CPUC's Public Advocates Office that would address our revenue requirement request but did not address rate design or certain other matters, including a request for continuation of a revenue stabilization mechanism. Decoupling is a critical tool for conservation efforts in California as it supports reliability and protection of water supply, which will help shape the future economic and environmental health of the communities we serve there. Once we receive the order later this year, we will determine whether we need to pursue further recourse in the state related to decoupling. On slide 11, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2025 results and our newly established EPS guidance range of $5.65 to $5.75 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by the returns on the capital invested to serve our customers. Cheryl will walk you through how our capital investment has grown and the specifics of the plan included in this update. As we talked about previously, 2024 is year three of our accelerated capital plan following the 2021 HOS sale. So we see that ramp-up partially reflected in earnings in 2025, both from base rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year. Also critical to our growth strategy is our ability to prudently manage the operating cost it takes to serve our customers. While we continue to have a strong culture of operating efficiencies and cost management, we do expect O&M increases in 2025 from higher production costs, including purchased water, fuel and power, annual wage increases as well as additional costs to serve our customers from recent acquisitions. The focus on operating cost efficiencies goes to the heart of the customer affordability construct we want to protect, which is closely aligned with the interest of regulators and ultimately investors in managing affordability of customer bills. The increases in general taxes, depreciation and long-term financing are driven by the continued capital investments in the system. And while I'm not called out on this slide, I'd like to note that our Military Services group still adds incrementally to our earnings growth expectation as shown in our growth outlook. MSG's great work on 18 military installations it serves, has built trust and resulted in the US government allocating additional funds for improvement projects, driving increased revenues. Turning to slide 12. I will provide a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile before closing with our five-year financing plan update. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, net of the $127 million of cash on hand remains at 56%, which is well within our target of less than 60%. Our expected dividend payout ratio for 2024 of 58% is also within our target range of 55% to 60%. I want to affirm that investors can expect our company to continue to be focused on these targets over the long-term. With our continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we also remain confident that we will have access to capital for the foreseeable future. In fact, we just extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility, which has a capacity of $2.75 billion by one year to October 2029. Our diversified banking relationships with some of the largest and strongest banks in the world, coupled with our fully regulated business model and strong credit ratings gives us great confidence around our liquidity. In addition, our laddered approach to long-term debt financing over the years has been very important in environments like the current one in managing cash flows and minimizing interest rate risk, which contributes to managing customer affordability and our short duration between general rate cases driven by our investment allows us to minimize the lag we may experience related to recovery of financing costs. From this position of balance sheet strength, let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of our five-year financing plan that will fund the increased capital plan. In our prior five-year plan covering 2024 to 2028, we expected a total of $1 billion of equity financing in the middle of that plan. That amount and timing remains unchanged. Our updated financing plan now covering 2025 to 2029 includes an estimated total of $2.5 billion of external equity issuances with the additional $1.5 billion expected near the end of the plan and all, of course, subject to market conditions. The level and timing of anticipated external equity is tied very simply to our need to fund growth and maintain our strong financial position. Investors should expect equity financing to occur routinely as determined by our investment program, rate case cycle and is appropriate to maintain our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Since we are already in alignment with our targets for debt to cap and dividend payout, we have the flexibility to adjust these plans and respond to market conditions when they change for the benefit of customers and investors alike. Finally, I'll wrap up noting that our current financing plan for calendar year 2025 includes $1.5 billion to $2 billion of long-term debt financing and no equity financing. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our five-year capital plan, our recent acquisition activity and outlook and affordability. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton : Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 15, I'll start with a discussion of our current long-term capital plan. For 2025, we expect our investment spending level to be $3.3 billion. From 2025 to 2029, we expect to invest $17 billion to $18 billion, an increase of about $1 billion over our previous five-year plan. This level of spending reflects the result of our consistent risk-based project planning. Along with risk, customer affordability is a key variable in our analysis, which I'll speak more about shortly. The increase in the current plan compared to last year is a combination of increased spending to meet compliance requirements for EPA's lead and copper rule improvements or LCRI, and rolling the plan forward a year. As you are aware, in October, the EPA issued the final LCRI, which sets a deadline near the end of 2037 for lead replacement by water utility providers for assets under their control, among other stipulations. American Water consistently meets water quality standards related to lead and copper rules across our footprint, and we are supportive of new or revised water quality standards such as LCRI. Removing the risk of lead service lines over time is absolutely the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. We are now expecting to spend about $1 billion over the next five years related to LCRI or about twice the rate of our recent annual spending, and we are still planning to invest approximately $1 billion in capital to comply with EPA's PFAS rule. In total, looking out over the next decade, we expect to invest about $40 billion to $42 billion in our regulated systems and acquisitions, which is $5 billion higher than the previous 10-year plan. One of our key initiatives with this higher level of investment is the expansion of our infrastructure renewal and replacement program. I want to finish this slide by acknowledging that our teams have done a great job executing our accelerated capital investment plans these last few years. We have consistently met our capital deployment goal each year, and we're on pace to do it again by spending $3.3 billion this year, which includes acquisition investments. These investments are crucial to continuing to deliver safe and clean water and ensure continued reliability of service to our customers. On Slide 16, I want to emphasize that timely capital recovery, which for us covers about 75% of our capital investments is foundational to promoting consistently excellent customer service and affordability. Investing in needed infrastructure on a continuous basis drives consistency of reliability of our services and of water quality. It also enables us to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers, which helps promote affordable monthly bills. And by reducing regulatory lag, timely capital recovery allows us to more closely earn our allowed return and better deliver consistent earnings growth. The pie chart on the right side of the page shows the breakdown of our capital spend by purpose over the next decade. While the vast majority of our capital is dedicated to basic replacement of aging pipes, we are also focused on fortifying our systems through resilient spending and preparing our systems for environmental compliance through investments in water quality. For example, we've recently invested $9 million in Sheridan, Indiana to help solve the community's sewer overflow issues that had restricted the community from growing due to EPA noncompliance. And in Hopewell, Virginia, we constructed a 2.5 million gallon storage tank to support proper water storage capacity. We have dozens of stories just like this that demonstrate the vital need for the capital investments we're making. And as we approach the 50th anniversary of the SAFE Drinking Water Act later this year, we know there is still much work to be done in our country and that our expertise in helping communities solve their drinking water issues will be needed for decades to come. Turning to Slide 17. You can see that we expect these capital investments in infrastructure and in acquisitions will grow regulated rate base at a long-term rate of 8% to 9%. Rate base growth, of course, will drive earnings growth. We believe the higher degree of visibility to our capital investment plan, combined with the low-risk nature of the plan, uniquely positions American Water in the utility sector and is fundamental to our investment thesis. Turning to Slide 18, where I'll cover customer affordability. We remain very focused on balancing customer affordability and the magnitude of the necessary investments in our plans. As I mentioned, customer affordability is a key variable in our annual capital planning analysis. We once again believe that the average residential water bill across our footprint as a percentage of median household income will continue to be below 1% throughout our five-year plan. Another recent example of the affordability programs we offer is in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania American Water expanded its H2O Help to Others discount program to customers with an income of up to 200% of the federal poverty level, up from 150% of that level. This change will expand discounted service to an additional 55,000 Pennsylvania American Water customers. We also expanded the H2O Help to Others grant program for customers up to 250% of the federal poverty level from 200%. Of note, as part of its acquisition of BASA, Pennsylvania American Water already committed to increase its shareholder contribution to the H2O Help to Others grant program by $3.5 million over five years, which will assist more customers through this important affordability program. Turning to our discussion of growth through acquisitions. Let me first say that I'm excited to lead our growing business development teams at the state and corporate level. On Slide 19, you'll see that we have successfully closed on six systems totaling $349 million through October 30, which added almost 50,000 new customers so far this year. Included in this total, as John mentioned earlier, is the big news in Pennsylvania from just a few days ago that we closed on the Butler Area Sewer Authority Wastewater System acquisition for $230 million. We remain very confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline and our ability to grow there. Looking ahead, we also continue to be well positioned for strong growth through acquisitions across many states with 43,400 customer connections totaling $169 million under agreement as of yesterday. Two quick highlights there. We have received commission approval of the acquisition of the Silver Creek, Indiana Water system and expect to close on it very soon. And in Maryland, we received commission approval in our first fair market value acquisition in the state, and we look forward to serving the former Severn Water Company customers. As we've mentioned over the last 18 to 24 months, we have invested more resources and added personnel to our business development teams and are starting to see that investment bear fruit with increased opportunities across our footprint. This expanded team, along with a more focused process for deal origination is driving a larger pipeline of potential acquisitions, now over 1.5 million connections compared to the previous pipeline of 1.3 million customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Susan for some closing thoughts. Susan?\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Cheryl, and I'm happy to be batting cleanup for us here today. You've heard from John, David, and Cheryl, a recap of our long-term strategy, and it should sound very consistent. Beyond our words, though, we have a proven track record of execution on our plans, including achieving our EPS guidance year after year. I fully expect 2025 to be another successful year, demonstrating consistent execution of our plans. Slide 21 is a compilation of the unique competitive advantages that we have at American Water that make us stand out as a premium utility. I've been on all sides of the regulated utility industry in the U.S. throughout my 40-year career, gas, electric and now water and wastewater. I know very well that there are some other great companies in the utility industry, ones that could cite three, four or maybe more of these qualities on their own resume. But what makes American Water unique from all of the others, though, in my opinion, is the collection of all of these attributes in a single investment opportunity. But let me be specific and call out just a few of these key attributes. American Water, without any dispute, is a top-tier performer on earnings and dividend growth. We have a geographic and resulting regulatory diversity that is rivaled by few. That diversity reduces risk period. And speaking of risk, our capital plan is low risk on a number of measures like decades of need and basic infrastructure renewal at the core of our plan. Our investment appeal based on our company's mission, values and these distinguishing fundamentals is compelling. Our mission is to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to the customers we are privileged to serve and to those that we hope to serve in the future that today are in need of the services we deliver. We can fulfill this mission and provide a fair return to our investors. Look, American Water has been doing this work since 1886. That's nearly 140 years, but there's much left to be done. Some may question and some do still today, the sense of urgency that we exhibit as we execute this investment plan. The sense of urgency is driven by the tremendous need, simply put. We will continue to do this work and deliver the superior returns our investors expect. It is a privilege to lead the 6,500 member team that is committed to and focused on delivering solutions to our customers. And you, our investors, make it possible for this important work to continue. And with that, I'll turn it back to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Richard Sunderland of JPMorgan. Go ahead, please.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for the time today.\nSusan Hardwick: Good morning, Rich.\nRichard Sunderland: So I've been getting a lot of questions on the financing plan and hoping you can walk through the $1.5 billion equity increase versus the $1 billion CapEx increase. Are there any timing factors to the financing plan driving equity higher than the incremental CapEx, like maybe capturing some of the years six through 10 equity in this current five-year plan?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, it's a good question, Rich. And obviously, we've seen a lot of commentary on that overnight and this morning as you all have been digesting the new plan here. I think it's as simple as a continued growing investment plan, as you've noted, and our continued focus on the strong balance sheet. We take very seriously the strength of the balance sheet and the metrics associated with that, and we've been very transparent on what those are. And we'll continue to finance the plan, the growing plan to maintain those expectations. I think it's pretty simple to think about it in those terms. The timing, I think, is maybe what's tripping people up a bit, but I think you just need to think about the size of our plan, the long-term nature of our plan, the outlook that we've provided from a long-term perspective here and our continued focus on that balance sheet. It's all just directly tied to those key objectives we have. And David, John, anything to add from your perspective here?\nJohn Griffith: No, I think you've really covered it, Susan.\nDavid Bowler: Yes. Maybe I'll just add one comment, Rich, which is if we think about the $1 billion increase in our five-year plan investment plan, keep in mind that even if we increased -- we didn't -- if we did not increase the five-year plan at all, right, we would still intend to raise equity in the latter part of the new plan period, right? We are growing the company 8% to 9% rate base growth. We generate a lot of internal cash flow. We raise debt, but we'll always be raising equity periodically to fund what we consider to be a robust capital plan. So I'd say the $1 billion increase in the five-year plan incrementally increased the amount of equity that we will be raising, but we'll always be in the business of periodically raising equity.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. That's very clear. And maybe I'll pick up on that last point and just unpack that a little bit more, because if you look at last year's update and then this year's update on the full balance of sources, the cash flow guidance uptick last year was larger than the uptick this year, maybe $2 billion versus $1 billion. I'm curious, if you could just unpack a little bit more of what's going on there in terms of your assumptions and expectations embedded in that? Are there any factors we should think about the roll forward last year versus the roll forward this year purely on the cash flow guidance?\nDavid Bowler: Rich, I think one factor that we have incorporated in here would be related to alternative minimum tax as a driver where we fully expect to be a cash taxpayer starting in 2025.\nJohn Griffith: And Rich, I would just add to that, that yes, as you recall, Rich, when we first accelerated our CapEx plan back in 2021, what we found is that we are investing even more capital than that accelerated plan. And so the enhanced capital investment that we're seeing is generating additional internal cash flow.\nRichard Sunderland: Perfect. Very helpful commentary. Thank you. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: The next question comes from Durgesh Chopra of Evercore ISI. You ahead please.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey, team. Good morning. David, congrats.\nDavid Bowler: Good morning.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, Susan. Nice job batting the closing remarks here. And David, congrats and look forward to working with you.\nDavid Bowler: Thanks.\nDurgesh Chopra: Yeah, absolutely. So maybe just guys, get your perspective on the strategy in Pennsylvania. As you roll this plan forward, how are you thinking about CapEx in the state versus previous assumptions, and then the rate case filing strategy in light of the order? Just any color you can offer there would be great. Thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Yeah, Rich, probably not a lot to add from our discussion last quarter. As we've continued to emphasize, our capital planning process is really risk-based. We're really looking at where the need is the greatest, and we'll allocate capital first according to that need. And then to the extent there are opportunities to continue to enhance service in those areas -- other areas, we'll look at those opportunities. I think that process has continued, and I think you'll continue to see us make significant investment in Pennsylvania, so no change there. And I'd also say -- and again, we talked about this last quarter as it relates to our rate case outcome there, while the ROE might have been lower than we had hoped for, we certainly have that built in this plan, and you can see us continue to emphasize strong growth rates year-over-year, our 2025 expected growth at 8%, all fully reflected in our plan. So we're moving forward.\nDurgesh Chopra: That's helpful, Susan. Thank you. And then, David, maybe I could just quickly follow-up. You talked about the AMT and being a full cash taxpayer in 2025. Could you help us with what like dollar amount of cash payments are you expecting in 2025 and going forward?\nDavid Bowler: Yes. I think you can think of it in the range of $100 million, plus or minus a year in cash taxes paid as part of AMT.\nDurgesh Chopra: Awesome. Thanks, again.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Angie Storozynski of Seaport. Go ahead, please\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So just one somewhat of a random question. So I'm just wondering, if you guys are making any plans on any changes in how you procure electricity. I mean I'm looking at the states where you operate, it seems like you will be exposed to quite an inflation in the cost of electricity. And so, are you trying to maybe lock in some of those prices ahead of time? And are you concerned about, for example, the affordability argument when the electricity prices were to go meaningfully up?\nDavid Bowler: Good morning, Angie, yes, good question. And we might have touched on this a little bit, I think, last quarter. But certainly, it's a major focus for us. Electricity costs are a big cost associated with the work that we do. And to that end, we have multiple long-term contracts already in place. I think some as far out as 2029. So we have this risk, I'd say, fairly well mitigated through our current contracting strategy.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. Changing topics. So you've obviously extended your growth rate. I think we're all looking at your earnings power beyond '26, right, when you lose the benefit of interest income. So I mean, what fills up that $0.10? Is it that you sort of step up the level of spending? Is it that you're hopeful for additional municipal M&A? I'm just wondering, again, how you can bridge the gap.\nDavid Bowler: Yes, Angie, we certainly have addressed this, I think a couple of times. I'll ask John to sort of reiterate what our view is here.\nJohn Griffith: Thanks for the question, Angie. As you recall back in 2021, when we put the note into place, we accelerated our capital plan at that point in time, increasing the 5-year plan by a couple of billion dollars at that point. And in the context of another question earlier, what we found is we've not only achieved that, I would say, but more. And so when you -- and we're always injecting equity into our operating companies to generate incremental regulated earnings. And that's really what's driving our ability to replace the interest income from the note. If you think about the interest income from the note, a lot of people look at it on an incremental basis and say, okay, there's effectively $0.20 of earnings going away, and that's from the $720 million note, it's 7% interest that we built into our 7% to 9% guidance forecast back in 2021. What people need to remember is we are bringing in $795 million, which is the original $720 million plus the earn-out payment that was rolled into the note. And if you think about that $795 million as -- that's avoiding incremental capital issuance, whether it's equity or debt. So if you're -- if you assume that we're avoiding long-term debt with that $795 million, pick a long-term interest rate, 5.5%, whatever you want to make up as a long-term debt interest rate. That result -- that offsets that $0.20, not all of it, but it gets you, call it, $0.17 or so. And we're really only filling kind of a $0.03 hole there. Nothing -- and so people kind of can't forget about the right side of the page that, yes, the interest income is going away, but we do have capital that we're avoiding incremental debt with. I would also note, Angie, that it's good for people to keep in mind that the final maturity date on the note is December 2026. But the borrower can call the note as of December 2025. And so it -- we'll see when the note gets taken out, but that's something just -- we could see it earlier than December 2026.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. And then lastly, on the frequency of rate cases. So again, we're trying to sort of understand what happened with the last rate case in Pennsylvania. And obviously, some of it was the frequency of the rate case filings. So I'm just wondering one could argue that you're filing rate cases more often, not just in Pennsylvania, but in other states because you really have to hit your allowed ROEs and the realized ROE has to be close -- as close as possible to the allowed. So I mean, how do you see it in your plan? I mean, are you assuming that in every jurisdiction, you basically hit that allowed ROE and that's what drives the earnings growth? What if there is some either slippage in those rate cases or the negative outcome of some of them?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes. Angie, on the rate case strategy, and I think we've been trying to make this point for a couple of years now. What really drives our rate case cycling is the need and the investment. We just continue to believe there is such tremendous need to do the work that we're doing that we've accelerated our capital investment program accordingly. And the more investment we make, the greater the growth in the rate base and the need for timely recovery. Now we have mechanisms and other approaches to get essentially 75% of that investment recovered what we would call sort of more timely, through periodic adjustments, but we still have the remaining investment that is subject to traditional regulatory process and the need to get timely recovery of that investment, along with the size of the investment is what drives that cycling. So our -- we don't build a rate case cycle just to hit a rate of return. We build it because that's how we're investing, and that's what the regulatory process calls for. So that's really what's behind the strategy. It's the need.\nAngie Storozynski: Awesome, thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Angie.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session and American Water's third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 15, I'll start with a discussion of our current long-term capital plan. For 2025, we expect our investment spending level to be $3.3 billion. From 2025 to 2029, we expect to invest $17 billion to $18 billion, an increase of about $1 billion over our previous five-year plan. This level of spending reflects the result of our consistent risk-based project planning. Along with risk, customer affordability is a key variable in our analysis, which I'll speak more about shortly. The increase in the current plan compared to last year is a combination of increased spending to meet compliance requirements for EPA's lead and copper rule improvements or LCRI, and rolling the plan forward a year.

Removing the risk of lead service lines over time is absolutely the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers. We are now expecting to spend about $1 billion over the next five years related to LCRI or about twice the rate of our recent annual spending, and we are still planning to invest approximately $1 billion in capital to comply with EPA's PFAS rule. In total, looking out over the next decade, we expect to invest about $40 billion to $42 billion in our regulated systems and acquisitions, which is $5 billion higher than the previous 10-year plan. One of our key initiatives with this higher level of investment is the expansion of our infrastructure renewal and replacement program. I want to finish this slide by acknowledging that our teams have done a great job executing our accelerated capital investment plans these last few years.

Pennsylvania American Water expanded its H2O Help to Others discount program to customers with an income of up to 200% of the federal poverty level, up from 150% of that level. This change will expand discounted service to an additional 55,000 Pennsylvania American Water customers. We also expanded the H2O Help to Others grant program for customers up to 250% of the federal poverty level from 200%. Of note, as part of its acquisition of BASA, Pennsylvania American Water already committed to increase its shareholder contribution to the H2O Help to Others grant program by $3.5 million over five years, which will assist more customers through this important affordability program. Turning to our discussion of growth through acquisitions. Let me first say that I'm excited to lead our growing business development teams at the state and corporate level. On Slide 19, you'll see that we have successfully closed on six systems totaling $349 million through October 30, which added almost 50,000 new customers so far this year. Included in this total, as John mentioned earlier, is the big news in Pennsylvania from just a few days ago that we closed on the Butler Area Sewer Authority Wastewater System acquisition for $230 million. We remain very confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline and our ability to grow there. Looking ahead, we also continue to be well positioned for strong growth through acquisitions across many states with 43,400 customer connections totaling $169 million under agreement as of yesterday. Two quick highlights there. We have received commission approval of the acquisition of the Silver Creek, Indiana Water system and expect to close on it very soon. And in Maryland, we received commission approval in our first fair market value acquisition in the state, and we look forward to serving the former Severn Water Company customers.

This expanded team, along with a more focused process for deal origination is driving a larger pipeline of potential acquisitions, now over 1.5 million connections compared to the previous pipeline of 1.3 million customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Susan for some closing thoughts. Susan?"

            "content": "Thanks, Aaron, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how happy we are to have David in the role of CFO, after having served as our Deputy CFO and Treasurer. You'll hear more from David shortly. And likewise, as we noted last quarter, I'm pleased to hand the business development baton to Cheryl, whose oversight of our state presidents and her role as Chief Operating Officer is key to our business development activities as we continue to drive enhanced focus on origination activities at the state level. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights from the third quarter and year-to-date periods. As we announced yesterday, we delivered strong financial results in the third quarter, in line with our expectations, adding to an already strong 2024. Earnings were $1.80 per share for the quarter compared to $1.66 for the same period last year. In the first nine months of 2024, earnings were $4.17 per share compared to $4.03 for the same period last year. Our results reflect the clear execution of our plan in 2024, which David and Cheryl will discuss further. These results give us confidence to affirm our 2024 EPS guidance of $5.25 to $5.30 per share, which, as you'll recall from last quarter, represents our narrowing of guidance to the top half of the previous guidance range. As a reminder, our 2024 and 2025 EPS guidance ranges include $0.10 per share of incremental interest income from the amendment of the HOS note earlier this year, which is on top of the interest income from the original note terms that we are replacing with earnings from the regulated business. As we've said in the past, repayment of the note is a component of our long-term financing plan as a source of funding for our growth. I also want to highlight that just a few days ago, we closed the $230 million acquisition of the Wastewater System Assets of Butler Area Sewer Authority in Pennsylvania. Our Pennsylvania team assisted by the corporate business development team worked hard to complete this deal, which adds 15,000 customers who we are pleased to begin serving. Turning to Slide 6. We are initiating our 2025 earnings guidance of $5.65 to $5.75 per share. This represents 8% EPS growth in 2025 compared to our weather-normalized 2024 EPS guidance, which David will discuss in further detail. As we roll out our updated 5-year plan today, we are affirming our long-term targets, including 7% to 9% EPS and dividend compounded annual growth rates. As a regulated water and wastewater utility, rate base growth, regulatory and capital execution and operational excellence are the key drivers of growth for our company. We expect to achieve 8% to 9% rate base growth over the next decade, driven by the accelerated CapEx plan we put forth 3 years ago to meet reliability, resiliency and compliance needs. Our rate base growth includes our regulated acquisition strategy, which drives a growing customer base, as well as the organic revenue growth opportunities we expect from our military services group. Along with our affordability and sustainability leadership, we believe these are the drivers of American Water's very competitive and sustainable shareholder return. In today's closing remarks, Susan will share her thoughts on our position as a premium regulated utility. In closing, on Slide 7, I want to emphasize that we expect to achieve consistent EPS growth within the 7% to 9% range through 2029 and beyond. We are demonstrating in 2024 and with our guidance for 2025 that the business plan we set forth following the sale of HOS is strong and compelling. Our commitment to solving problems for our customers remains steadfast, including addressing PFAS, letting copper and aging infrastructure, among other challenges. No other water and wastewater utility has the combination of the scale, geographic diversity and expertise that we have. This foundation, coupled with the capital investment needs in our industry uniquely positions American Water to achieve consistently strong earnings growth for many years to come. One final note, before I turn it over to David. As you know, earlier this month, we notified stakeholders of unauthorized activity within our computer networks and systems, which we determined to be the result of a cybersecurity incident. Importantly, none of the company's water or wastewater facilities were impacted by this incident. While the investigation of the incident by a dedicated team of professionals is ongoing, we do not expect that this incident will have a material effect on the company or its financial condition or results of operations. With that, I'll hand it over to David to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. David? No, I think you've really covered it, Susan. And Rich, I would just add to that, that yes, as you recall, Rich, when we first accelerated our CapEx plan back in 2021, what we found is that we are investing even more capital than that accelerated plan. And so the enhanced capital investment that we're seeing is generating additional internal cash flow. Thanks for the question, Angie. As you recall back in 2021, when we put the note into place, we accelerated our capital plan at that point in time, increasing the 5-year plan by a couple of billion dollars at that point. And in the context of another question earlier, what we found is we've not only achieved that, I would say, but more. And so when you -- and we're always injecting equity into our operating companies to generate incremental regulated earnings. And that's really what's driving our ability to replace the interest income from the note. If you think about the interest income from the note, a lot of people look at it on an incremental basis and say, okay, there's effectively $0.20 of earnings going away, and that's from the $720 million note, it's 7% interest that we built into our 7% to 9% guidance forecast back in 2021. What people need to remember is we are bringing in $795 million, which is the original $720 million plus the earn-out payment that was rolled into the note. And if you think about that $795 million as -- that's avoiding incremental capital issuance, whether it's equity or debt. So if you're -- if you assume that we're avoiding long-term debt with that $795 million, pick a long-term interest rate, 5.5%, whatever you want to make up as a long-term debt interest rate. That result -- that offsets that $0.20, not all of it, but it gets you, call it, $0.17 or so. And we're really only filling kind of a $0.03 hole there. Nothing -- and so people kind of can't forget about the right side of the page that, yes, the interest income is going away, but we do have capital that we're avoiding incremental debt with. I would also note, Angie, that it's good for people to keep in mind that the final maturity date on the note is December 2026. But the borrower can call the note as of December 2025. And so it -- we'll see when the note gets taken out, but that's something just -- we could see it earlier than December 2026."

            "name": "David Bowler",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Before I get started with results, let me first say how excited I am to assume the role of CFO at American Water and continue my work with this great team. I also look forward to meeting many of you at EEI in a couple of weeks. Turning to slide 9. Let me provide a few more details on year-to-date results. Consolidated earnings were $4.17 per share, up $0.14 per share compared to the same period in 2023 and up $0.18 per share on a weather-normalized basis. As noted, earnings in 2024 were higher by an estimated $0.07 per share as a result of weather in the second and third quarters as compared to $0.11 per share of favorable weather in the second and third quarters of 2023. Excluding the impacts of weather, revenues increased by $0.84 per share, driven primarily by general rate case outcomes in 2023 and thus far in 2024. And looking at operating costs, O&M was higher by $0.19 per share, driven primarily by employee-related costs and other increases to support growth in the business as we expected. Production costs related to fuel, power and chemicals were also slightly higher compared to this period in 2023. Next, general taxes, which are comprised of property and gross receipts taxes were higher by $0.06 per share with the increase in property tax tied to the level of capital investment and higher gross receipts tax driven by higher revenue, primarily in New Jersey. Depreciation increased $0.21 per share and long-term financing costs increased $0.28 per share both as expected in support of our investment growth. The higher long-term financing cost includes interest on the $1 billion convertible note issuance from last June, the $1.4 billion senior note issuance in this February as well as $0.07 of dilution from last year's equity issuance. And finally, we had $0.07 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of Homeowner Services. As we've stated, we will continue to break this out quarterly so investors can track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy without this additional interest income. I will also note in the appendix, you will find details on the third quarter EPS, which has many of the same drivers as the year-to-date results. On slide 10, I will review the latest regulatory activity in our states. First, on completed cases. We received an order from the New Jersey Commission in September approving without modification, our settlement agreement of an additional $80 million in annualized revenues that was effective September 15. The commission again approved an allowed return on equity of 9.6% and an equity layer of 55%. New Jersey continues to be a constructive state that is supportive of investment to serve our customers well. Turning to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in seven jurisdictions. These cases are centered around the capital investments we have made and will continue to make in these states. In Missouri, we originally filed a rate case with a proposal for a full future test year, which the commission declined to accept at this time. However, the commission provided an allowance for discrete adjustments that recognize investments through May 2025. While not the ruling we wanted in this case, we are encouraged by the conversations we've had with the commission and are continuing to work on a legislative path for a future test year in Missouri. Otherwise, our case in Missouri is progressing as expected. In Illinois, we received a proposed decision from the administrative law judge on October 24, recommending a 9.84% return on equity and a 49% equity layer. A final order in this case is expected no later than December 17 with new rates implemented January 1, 2025. In Virginia, on September 20, we filed a black box settlement with the Virginia Commission, which agreed to a $15 million annualized increase in revenues compared to our ask of $20 million. The settlement stipulation also specified a return on equity of 9.7%, which matches the current allowed return and a capital structure with an equity component of 45.67%, which compares to the current approved cap structure of 40.73%. The settlement remains subject to commission review and approval. In California, we expect the final rate case decision on December 5 with new rates retroactive to January 1, 2024. As a reminder, we reached a partial settlement agreement in November 2023 with the CPUC's Public Advocates Office that would address our revenue requirement request but did not address rate design or certain other matters, including a request for continuation of a revenue stabilization mechanism. Decoupling is a critical tool for conservation efforts in California as it supports reliability and protection of water supply, which will help shape the future economic and environmental health of the communities we serve there. Once we receive the order later this year, we will determine whether we need to pursue further recourse in the state related to decoupling. On slide 11, we provide some considerations regarding our outlook for 2025 results and our newly established EPS guidance range of $5.65 to $5.75 per share. First, as you would expect, our growth will be driven by the returns on the capital invested to serve our customers. Cheryl will walk you through how our capital investment has grown and the specifics of the plan included in this update. As we talked about previously, 2024 is year three of our accelerated capital plan following the 2021 HOS sale. So we see that ramp-up partially reflected in earnings in 2025, both from base rate cases and infrastructure mechanisms. Recent regulated acquisitions that are being incorporated into active or just completed rate cases will also drive growth next year. Also critical to our growth strategy is our ability to prudently manage the operating cost it takes to serve our customers. While we continue to have a strong culture of operating efficiencies and cost management, we do expect O&M increases in 2025 from higher production costs, including purchased water, fuel and power, annual wage increases as well as additional costs to serve our customers from recent acquisitions. The focus on operating cost efficiencies goes to the heart of the customer affordability construct we want to protect, which is closely aligned with the interest of regulators and ultimately investors in managing affordability of customer bills. The increases in general taxes, depreciation and long-term financing are driven by the continued capital investments in the system. And while I'm not called out on this slide, I'd like to note that our Military Services group still adds incrementally to our earnings growth expectation as shown in our growth outlook. MSG's great work on 18 military installations it serves, has built trust and resulted in the US government allocating additional funds for improvement projects, driving increased revenues. Turning to slide 12. I will provide a look at our balance sheet and liquidity profile before closing with our five-year financing plan update. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, net of the $127 million of cash on hand remains at 56%, which is well within our target of less than 60%. Our expected dividend payout ratio for 2024 of 58% is also within our target range of 55% to 60%. I want to affirm that investors can expect our company to continue to be focused on these targets over the long-term. With our continued focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet, we also remain confident that we will have access to capital for the foreseeable future. In fact, we just extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility, which has a capacity of $2.75 billion by one year to October 2029. Our diversified banking relationships with some of the largest and strongest banks in the world, coupled with our fully regulated business model and strong credit ratings gives us great confidence around our liquidity. In addition, our laddered approach to long-term debt financing over the years has been very important in environments like the current one in managing cash flows and minimizing interest rate risk, which contributes to managing customer affordability and our short duration between general rate cases driven by our investment allows us to minimize the lag we may experience related to recovery of financing costs. From this position of balance sheet strength, let's turn to Slide 13 for a review of our five-year financing plan that will fund the increased capital plan. In our prior five-year plan covering 2024 to 2028, we expected a total of $1 billion of equity financing in the middle of that plan. That amount and timing remains unchanged. Our updated financing plan now covering 2025 to 2029 includes an estimated total of $2.5 billion of external equity issuances with the additional $1.5 billion expected near the end of the plan and all, of course, subject to market conditions. The level and timing of anticipated external equity is tied very simply to our need to fund growth and maintain our strong financial position. Investors should expect equity financing to occur routinely as determined by our investment program, rate case cycle and is appropriate to maintain our strong balance sheet and credit metrics. Since we are already in alignment with our targets for debt to cap and dividend payout, we have the flexibility to adjust these plans and respond to market conditions when they change for the benefit of customers and investors alike. Finally, I'll wrap up noting that our current financing plan for calendar year 2025 includes $1.5 billion to $2 billion of long-term debt financing and no equity financing. With that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our five-year capital plan, our recent acquisition activity and outlook and affordability. Cheryl? Yes. Maybe I'll just add one comment, Rich, which is if we think about the $1 billion increase in our five-year plan investment plan, keep in mind that even if we increased -- we didn't -- if we did not increase the five-year plan at all, right, we would still intend to raise equity in the latter part of the new plan period, right? We are growing the company 8% to 9% rate base growth. We generate a lot of internal cash flow. We raise debt, but we'll always be raising equity periodically to fund what we consider to be a robust capital plan. So I'd say the $1 billion increase in the five-year plan incrementally increased the amount of equity that we will be raising, but we'll always be in the business of periodically raising equity. Rich, I think one factor that we have incorporated in here would be related to alternative minimum tax as a driver where we fully expect to be a cash taxpayer starting in 2025. Good morning. Thanks. Yes. I think you can think of it in the range of $100 million, plus or minus a year in cash taxes paid as part of AMT. Good morning, Angie, yes, good question. And we might have touched on this a little bit, I think, last quarter. But certainly, it's a major focus for us. Electricity costs are a big cost associated with the work that we do. And to that end, we have multiple long-term contracts already in place. I think some as far out as 2029. So we have this risk, I'd say, fairly well mitigated through our current contracting strategy. Yes, Angie, we certainly have addressed this, I think a couple of times. I'll ask John to sort of reiterate what our view is here."

            "content": "Thanks, Cheryl, and I'm happy to be batting cleanup for us here today. You've heard from John, David, and Cheryl, a recap of our long-term strategy, and it should sound very consistent. Beyond our words, though, we have a proven track record of execution on our plans, including achieving our EPS guidance year after year. I fully expect 2025 to be another successful year, demonstrating consistent execution of our plans. Slide 21 is a compilation of the unique competitive advantages that we have at American Water that make us stand out as a premium utility. I've been on all sides of the regulated utility industry in the U.S. throughout my 40-year career, gas, electric and now water and wastewater. I know very well that there are some other great companies in the utility industry, ones that could cite three, four or maybe more of these qualities on their own resume. But what makes American Water unique from all of the others, though, in my opinion, is the collection of all of these attributes in a single investment opportunity. But let me be specific and call out just a few of these key attributes. American Water, without any dispute, is a top-tier performer on earnings and dividend growth. We have a geographic and resulting regulatory diversity that is rivaled by few. That diversity reduces risk period. And speaking of risk, our capital plan is low risk on a number of measures like decades of need and basic infrastructure renewal at the core of our plan. Our investment appeal based on our company's mission, values and these distinguishing fundamentals is compelling. Our mission is to provide safe, clean, reliable and affordable services to the customers we are privileged to serve and to those that we hope to serve in the future that today are in need of the services we deliver. We can fulfill this mission and provide a fair return to our investors. Look, American Water has been doing this work since 1886. That's nearly 140 years, but there's much left to be done. Some may question and some do still today, the sense of urgency that we exhibit as we execute this investment plan. The sense of urgency is driven by the tremendous need, simply put. We will continue to do this work and deliver the superior returns our investors expect. It is a privilege to lead the 6,500 member team that is committed to and focused on delivering solutions to our customers. And you, our investors, make it possible for this important work to continue. And with that, I'll turn it back to our operator to begin Q&A and take any questions you may have. Good morning, Rich. Yes, it's a good question, Rich. And obviously, we've seen a lot of commentary on that overnight and this morning as you all have been digesting the new plan here. I think it's as simple as a continued growing investment plan, as you've noted, and our continued focus on the strong balance sheet. We take very seriously the strength of the balance sheet and the metrics associated with that, and we've been very transparent on what those are. And we'll continue to finance the plan, the growing plan to maintain those expectations. I think it's pretty simple to think about it in those terms. The timing, I think, is maybe what's tripping people up a bit, but I think you just need to think about the size of our plan, the long-term nature of our plan, the outlook that we've provided from a long-term perspective here and our continued focus on that balance sheet. It's all just directly tied to those key objectives we have. And David, John, anything to add from your perspective here? Thanks, Rich. Yeah, Rich, probably not a lot to add from our discussion last quarter. As we've continued to emphasize, our capital planning process is really risk-based. We're really looking at where the need is the greatest, and we'll allocate capital first according to that need. And then to the extent there are opportunities to continue to enhance service in those areas -- other areas, we'll look at those opportunities. I think that process has continued, and I think you'll continue to see us make significant investment in Pennsylvania, so no change there. And I'd also say -- and again, we talked about this last quarter as it relates to our rate case outcome there, while the ROE might have been lower than we had hoped for, we certainly have that built in this plan, and you can see us continue to emphasize strong growth rates year-over-year, our 2025 expected growth at 8%, all fully reflected in our plan. So we're moving forward. Yes. Angie, on the rate case strategy, and I think we've been trying to make this point for a couple of years now. What really drives our rate case cycling is the need and the investment. We just continue to believe there is such tremendous need to do the work that we're doing that we've accelerated our capital investment program accordingly. And the more investment we make, the greater the growth in the rate base and the need for timely recovery. Now we have mechanisms and other approaches to get essentially 75% of that investment recovered what we would call sort of more timely, through periodic adjustments, but we still have the remaining investment that is subject to traditional regulatory process and the need to get timely recovery of that investment, along with the size of the investment is what drives that cycling. So our -- we don't build a rate case cycle just to hit a rate of return. We build it because that's how we're investing, and that's what the regulatory process calls for. So that's really what's behind the strategy. It's the need. Thanks, Angie."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations Web site. The audio webcast archive will be available for one year on American Water's Investor Relations website. I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin\nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some Safe Harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the second quarter earnings release and in our June 30 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC. And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share refer to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions. With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's CEO, Susan Hardwick.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. As we announced yesterday, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter and first half of 2024. Earnings were $1.42 per share for the quarter, compared to $1.44 for the same period last year. In the first 6 months of 2024 and 2023, earnings were $2.37 per share. The results for both periods were in line with our expectations. Our expectations were based on the timing of revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings and infrastructure mechanism filings expected to be effective in the latter half of 2024, which I'll speak more about shortly. With our year-to-date execution and customer usage declines being a bit less than we had planned for so far in 2024, we have raised our 2024 EPS guidance by narrowing it to the top half of the guidance range. Our expectations for 2024 are now $5.25 per share to $5.30 per share. John will share more about our results and guidance a bit later. Moving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2024. We invested $1.4 billion in capital projects year-to-date, again, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. We were also very pleased to add 43,000 customers in our first half of the year from acquisitions and organic growth. Our outlook for future acquisitions remained very strong as we have nearly $500 million in acquisitions under agreement. And earlier this week, we were pleased to publish our company's latest sustainability report for 2023. It reflects how we are fulfilling our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service in a very sustainable manner to American Water customers. This has been our mission for over 135 years and counting. Turning to Slide 6 and back to the topic of regulatory recovery, I want to acknowledge the great work of our state and corporate regulatory teams as they continue to successfully execute on our regulatory strategy. We have completed four cases already in 2024 in Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, all of which authorized 100% of the capital investments we have made or will make in each state. We also have several other general rate cases and timely infrastructure recovery mechanisms currently in front of regulators that I'm confident will be reasonably decided. Cheryl will provide some additional updates on our active general rate cases a little later. Let's zoom out for a minute, though. I want to remind investors that we strategically choose to operate in a diverse set of regulatory environments that we believe have been and will remain supportive of water and wastewater utility investments and consolidation. As I told you earlier this year, American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work that we do across our footprint. Policymakers in our states often understand that historic $20 or $30 per month water bills don't equate to adequately invested systems or the highest quality services for residents. Those relatively low legacy rates often signal significant underinvestment, below average reliability and/or water quality, wastewater overflow issues, or all of the above. That's why policymakers frequently encourage American Water to keep growing, keep investing, and keep solving problems in their states. We often are called on by regulators and policymakers when there is a need for experts to take over a failing community water system. We have a very recent example of just that in the state of Pennsylvania. As you know, we just completed our rate case in Pennsylvania, and the Commission released its order in that case on July 22. It was a case that reflected $1 billion of investment since our last case, which was decided just a short 18 months ago. It's important to note that the Commission approved 100% of the capital invested or to be invested by the end of the future test year of June 30, 2025. There is no dispute about the investments being made and the absolute need for the investment to continue to update our systems to ensure that citizens of Pennsylvania, where we operate, are confident in their water and wastewater service. Certainly, we've received comments about the pace of our regulatory strategy in Pennsylvania. What drives that pace is the need, plain and simple. And of course that pace of investment leads to increased customer bills. We're focused on that issue in every aspect of our regulatory planning and the efforts we continue to drive to ensure customer affordability, from cost management and driving efficiencies, to innovative tariff approaches, to a direct customer assistance. At the end of the day, though, the need for investment is not decreasing. As you assess the recent Pennsylvania order outcome, it's helpful to understand the reconciliation of the order findings to our request. Really there are only two or three things that reconcile the full difference. Recall that we requested a revenue increase of about $200 million and an ROE of 10.95%. An ROE request, which is fully reflective of an increasingly risky business because of higher capital costs, new and emerging regulations, and an increasing need for resiliency, to name just a few of the drivers. The ROE differential between our request and the commission's unprecedented and frankly unsupported finding of 9.45% is $71 million of revenue. Additionally, the Butler Area Sewer Authority acquisition, though fully approved by the commission previously, was removed from the revenue requirement because the transaction is not yet closed. That impact is $23 million of requested revenue. The remaining $11 million delta from our request to the final authorized revenue requirement is made up of a few cost-of-service items. In summary, the order found our request to be fully reasonable, but for the ROE finding. We will continue to be very present in Pennsylvania as we serve our customers, but we will evaluate what is the -- what this result means to our overall allocation of capital investment among our various states. Investors certainly expect a fair return, and it is part of our mission to provide that opportunity while fully serving our customers. Selectively, we believe there is a very long runway of investment opportunities in the communities we serve across our 14 states for organic CapEx and for growth through acquisitions. And further, we believe the regulatory and legislative environments in our 14 states continue to be conducive to earning a fair and reasonable return on the investments we're making and that you, our investors, are counting on. We do all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value of quality service and sustainable operations, which leads us to Slide 7, and what I believe are the drivers of American Water's very competitive and sustainable shareholder return built on the foundation of the regulatory execution I just discussed. This quarter we are again affirming our long-term targets, including both earnings and dividend growth targets at an industry-leading pace of 7% to 9% over the next 5 years and beyond. This affirmation is based on our clear top-tier growth, capital growth plan, and our solid regulatory and operational execution. Our track record of execution on these fronts gives us confidence and should give investors confidence in our ability to achieve our short-term and our long-term financial targets. Finally, let me spend just a few minutes on the leadership news we detailed in our earnings release. I'm excited to release [ph] John has been named President of American Water. This is a decision the American Water Board and I have worked on for some time, and it really is about our intentional effort to build a pipeline of talent through career development to ensure we have a strong leadership foundation for the long-term. With this shift, I will continue to lead the overall strategic direction of our company as the CEO, and as an American Water Board member. John will lead the continued execution of our strategies and daily operations. He will continue to report to me and our Executive Leadership team will report to John. Cheryl will expand her COO role and now lead Business Development. When you consider how she has led our increased capital program, her extensive water quality expertise given the ever-increasing regulations, and her reputation in this industry. This is a natural expansion of her role as we continue to bring solutions to even more communities across the country. David Bowler, who you will hear from next quarter, has been named Executive Vice President and CFO, and Nick Furia has been named Vice President and Treasurer. Let me just say a few words about John, Cheryl, David and Nick, as we are really pleased to have all four expand their roles. You know John well. He has more than 25 years of industry knowledge and expertise and significant experience in leading high-performance teams, strategy development, and execution. Most importantly, he has a deep understanding of our company's purpose and a strong commitment to our customers, employees, and shareholders. Cheryl has more than 35 years of experience and expertise. She has led our lab, served as President in three of our states, and does an incredible job leading all areas of our operations. She, too, has a strong sense of the purpose of American Water. David has nearly 20 years of deep experience in the utility industry and has been our Deputy CFO and Treasurer since 2022. He has significant experience in all aspects of financial management and strategy, including finance strategy and planning, treasury, accounting, enterprise risk and capital markets. And Nick Furia has 10 years of experience with American Water and has served as our Assistant Treasurer since 2021, overseeing key treasury-related functions, including financing, cash flow, liquidity, overall cap structure management. He also served as the Director of Acquisitions at American Water and has nearly 20 years of experience in accounting and finance roles. All have a strong commitment to the success of our company and are well suited for their new and expanded roles. We firmly believe we have further solidified an already top talent leadership team. Our leadership team and the American Water Board of Directors are excited about these changes and highly confident this team will support the execution of our plans now and well into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our recent regulatory updates, affordability and the capital plan. Cheryl?\nCheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am about today's leadership news, and I look forward to working even more closely with our business development team to provide water and wastewater solutions to many more new communities. I'm also very confident that we have the right team for the long-term success of this company. On Slide 9, I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. In Pennsylvania, as Susan just laid out, the commission issued an order in July authorizing an additional $99 million in annualized revenues effective August 7. There are two other items from the order worth noting. The PUC encouraged Pennsylvania American Water to set a target donation to its hardship fund of an additional $1 million. Of note, as part of its acquisition of the Butler Area Sewer Authority, Pennsylvania American Water already committed to increase its shareholder contribution to the H2O Help to Others grant program by $3.5 million over 5 years. As you know, the BASA acquisition was approved by the PUC in November of 2023, but it was appealed to the Commonwealth Court. So the PUC approved expansion of these assistance programs awaits a decision from that court. Regarding the water quality issues raised in the order, we acknowledged that some customers in the Northeast part of our Pennsylvania service area experience temporary aesthetic disturbances associated with system improvements and operational maintenance. Let me be clear. Our water meets all state and federal drinking water regulations. We take customer comments about water quality very seriously and will work with the Commission on the matters raised. As part of this commitment, we attempted personal outreach to every customer who raised a water quality concern during the public hearings to better understand and resolve their issues. With 33 Pennsylvania American Water's water treatment plants nationally recognized with the Director's Awards for participating in the EPA's Partnership for Safe Water. We are fully committed to high-quality, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services. Switching over to Kentucky, the Commission there issued an order on May 3 authorizing an additional $11 million in annualized revenues. Since the company had implemented interim rates effective February 6 based on the requested revenue of $26 million. The order requires a refund with interest to customers retroactive to this date. It does not include the infrastructure surcharge revenues of $10 million, which add to our investment recovery in the state. We filed with the Commission a petition for a rehearing of the rate case order seeking clarification or correction of certain quantifications with respect to the authorized amount of annualized revenues. Of the handful of issues we have raised, the one of most significance appears to be a mathematical error that once corrected would result in a higher revenue requirement. We expect resolution of this proceeding later in 2024. Turning to active cases, you can see we have general rate cases in progress in seven jurisdictions. All of these cases are centered around the capital investments we've made and will continue to make in these states, and all of them are proceeding as we expected. On July 1, we filed a general rate case in Missouri, reflecting a $1.5 billion in system investments, covering January 2023 through May 2026. We are seeking $148 million of additional annual revenue. Rate cases in Missouri usually take up to 11 months, and we expect new rates to become effective mid-2025. In Illinois, the next milestones in the case will be evidentiary hearings in August, followed by briefing from all parties in September, and then a proposed order due in October. In California, we still expect a final rate case decision in the second half of 2024. New rates will be implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024. As a reminder, we reached the partial settlement agreement in November of 2023 with the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, which would address our revenue requirement -- request, but does not address rate design or certain other matters, including our request for continuation of a revenue stability mechanism. Also of note, the California Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion concluding that the Commission erred when it prohibited water utilities from proposing to continue their water revenue adjustment mechanisms. According -- accordingly, the court vacated the portion of the Commission's 2020 decision relating to this prohibition. Decoupling is a critical tool for conservation efforts in California. Adequate water supply reliability for all uses is essential to the future economic and environmental health of the communities we serve there. In New Jersey, as outlined in the procedural schedule, the company is in confidential settlement discussions among the parties to the proceeding and we hope to have a resolution soon. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 10 that we have $266 million in annualized new revenues and rates so far in 2024. This includes $176 million from general rate cases and step increases and $90 million from infrastructure surcharges. In total, we have $546 million of total annualized revenue requests pending. Most of the annual authorized revenues we are expecting in 2024, have effective dates which will have a stronger impact on financial results in the second half of the year. Moving to Slide 11, and a topic you've heard us cover just about every quarter, customer affordability. And as we've said, we are very focused on balancing customer affordability and the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. An example of this is included in the Missouri general rate case we filed on July 1st. We are proposing a new income-based discounted rate for customers below 150% of the federal poverty level. We also currently offer assistance through our H2O Help to Others program, which is available to any Missouri American Water customer and meets the basic needs criteria as set by the community action agency caseworkers. We also continue to strongly advocate for a permanent, federally funded, low-income water assistance program similar to what's been in place for many years for gas and electric utility customers and what was temporarily in place for water customers during COVID. Turning to Slide 12. As Susan reviewed earlier, highlighted here is an example of the constructive regulatory and legislative environments we operate in. Our theme here is not only around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs, but also around offering affordability programs and tariffs to those customers who need it the most. As I alluded to earlier, American Water has consistently engaged with policymakers and regulators over the years to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure to serve the long-term best interest of our customers while also achieving timely recovery. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it promotes affordability by leveling out customer ability bill impacts over time, making those bills more manageable for our customers. I'd like to point out that we offer affordability programs in most of our states, which is something we have been doing for some time now. We also have specific low income tariffs enacted in four of our biggest states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, and West Virginia. And as I mentioned on the last slide, we are seeking to add Missouri to this list once our general rate case concludes next year. Lastly, Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams again did a great job in the quarter executing on our increased capital plan. They safely completed the hundreds of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by almost $200 million in the first half of 2024, compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.1 billion of capital investment in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John?\nJohn Griffith: Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. I, too, look forward to all of our new roles. We have a great future ahead of us and much work to do as we continue to make communities stronger through the essential water and wastewater services we provide. Turning to Slide 15, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $1.42 per share for the quarter, down $0.02 per share versus the same period in 2023, but up $0.02 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Recently completed rate cases in Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky, in addition to rate outcomes achieved last year, are driving increased revenues. While weather led to a net unfavorable impact on earnings quarter-over-quarter of an estimated $0.04 per share, earnings in the second quarter of 2024 were favorably impacted by an estimated $0.03 per share of weather due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in New Jersey, while earnings were favorably impacted in Q2 of 2023 by an estimated $0.07 per share of weather due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. And looking at operating costs, increased employee-related costs caused O&M to increase $0.03 per share, as expected, from normal wage increases somewhat offset by lower headcount. Production costs related to fuel, power, and chemicals costs were flat compared to this period in 2023. Next, depreciation increased $0.07 per share, and long-term financing costs increased $0.11 per share, both as expected, in support of our investment growth. Long-term financing costs include interest on the $1 billion convertible note issuance from last June and the $1.4 billion long-term senior note issuance this February. And finally, we had $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS. We will continue to break this out quarterly so investors will be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy without this additional interest income. Turning to Slide 16, earnings were flat for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, earnings have increased $0.04 per share year-to-date, which as Susan mentioned, is in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. Turning to our discussion of growth through acquisitions, on Slide 17 you'll see that we successfully closed on five systems for $119 million through June 30, which added approximately 33,400 new customers. The newest additions include the water and wastewater systems in Salem, New Jersey, and Cape Charles, Virginia, which followed the Granite City, Illinois, Wastewater Treatment Plant acquisition we closed in Q1. We've also added 9,600 customers through organic growth through June 30. We continue to be well-positioned for strong growth through acquisitions, with 59,000 customer connections and $483 million under agreement as of quarter end. Many states in our footprint are contributing to this total, which mirrors the broad-based pipeline of opportunities we have in progress across the country. As a reminder, we have received PUC approval for the acquisition of the 15,000-customer BASA wastewater system in Pennsylvania. The PUC's approval is under appeal, and we await a decision from the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court to proceed with closing. On June 13, the Pennsylvania Commission voted to adopt revisions to procedures around Act 12 fair market value. The provisions in this final order were largely the same as the proposed version we covered on the first quarter call. And as we said on the first quarter call, we believe these provisions are a constructive step for continued consolidation in Pennsylvania as they reaffirm the core principles of Act 12. We do expect the closing of current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline. Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial position. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of June 30, net of our $48 million of cash on hand as 56%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. And finally, on Slide 19, yesterday we announced that we are raising our 2024 EPS guidance by narrowing it to the top half of the range we first disclosed in February. The 2024 EPS guidance range is now $5.25 to $5.30, from $5.20 to $5.30 previously, and still on a weather-normalized basis. As Susan mentioned, this change is driven by lower-than-expected declines in customer usage, which is something we track closely and now believe we can count on for the remainder of the year. Coupled with the fact that we have several revenue increases effective in Q2 and Q3, we expect second half 2024 will deliver financial results to achieve this narrow guidance range. This puts us on track to deliver 8.5% EPS growth in 2024 at the new midpoint. Our high-level outlook for 2024 otherwise remains unchanged from what we previously disclosed, and we again affirm our long-term financial targets. We believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth, coupled with our affordability position and DSG leadership, will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and our position as the largest and most geographically diversified water and wastewater utility in the country distinguish us from all other utilities. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Durgesh Chopra from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDurgesh Chopra: Hey team, good morning. First off, congrats on all the leadership announcements here to all of you.\nJohn Griffith: Good morning, Durgesh. Thanks.\nDurgesh Chopra: Good morning, Susan. Susan, thank you for all the color you provided as it relates to Pennsylvania rate case. I'm just thinking about how, if at all, this changes your regulatory strategy in the state, the timing of rate cases, the ask, the capital spending, how should we think about that just thinking about the impacts of the order?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, I think it's a great question. It's obviously something we're going to continue to analyze very closely as we continue to work on our plan update for the fall. But as we said in prepared remarks, the need is not going away. The state of infrastructure and the need for continued focus on improvements and resiliency is not declining in any way, so we know we have investments that need to made in Pennsylvania. We will need to look, though, at how we -- how and how much capital we allocate to the state of Pennsylvania relative to our other states, given this low ROE result in Pennsylvania. It is a real balance of shareholder expectations and the allocation of capital that we really need to think through. Again, we're not going to compromise service. We're not going to compromise safety in any way, but as we think about the pace at which we are making investments, we do have to take into account the return opportunity provided to investors. So I think it's just a question, Durgesh, we're going to have to continue to evaluate a bit, and we'll have more to say about that as we get into sort of our fall planning and updates that we'll provide later in the fall. In total, we don't expect our capital plans to change at all. We again know that the need exists across our entire territory and to the extent we shift dollars from one state to the other should not impact our total expectations.\nDurgesh Chopra: Got it. That's very helpful. That's all I have. Thank you.\nJohn Griffith: Thanks, Durgesh.\nOperator: The next question comes from Richard Sunderland from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nRichard Sunderland: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the time today and congratulations as well for all the leadership updates.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Rich.\nRichard Sunderland: Following up on the capital reallocation question earlier, understand the considerations you just laid out particularly around ROE, but wanted to ask this specific to M&A in Pennsylvania. Is that something you're also looking at potentially slowing the pace of acquisitions in the state?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, again, I think there's so many opportunities in all of our states really from a acquisition growth perspective and we know we've got a great pipeline in Pennsylvania, a lot of good opportunities there and our team continues to work very, very hard to identify those opportunities and move them all along. And we're not going to slow that pace at all. I think if there's a pace issue at all in Pennsylvania, it will really be around just the environment-related to fair market value and the commission's process they put in place to review acquisitions, which we think, by the way, is very positive. We think the approach the commission has taken there to really put some guidelines around looking at acquisitions and benefits being provided to customers we think will be helpful. But it's still a difficult environment to get those transactions across the finish line. So again, our view is we don't change anything about what we're doing. We'll see how the process works with all the parties involved in those types of proceedings and how the commission handles all of that through the approval process.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. That's helpful commentary there. And then separately, you pointed out the 2H weighting to earnings and very clear what the drivers of that are. I guess thinking about this dynamic over your forecast period, how do you see your EPS profile tracking over the period? Do you expect any lumpiness in results?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, I'll probably turn to John on that. John, you want to comment there?\nJohn Griffith: Rich, not lumpiness. So we maintain our 7% to 9% long-term growth. We've been asked a question in the past off of what base year? We don't pick a base year. As you know, we came out of a transition in 2021 selling HOS, selling New York. That was '21 to '22, '22 to '23, we were inside of the 7% to 9%. We expect to be this year. And we frankly think our goal is that it shouldn't matter a lot what year somebody picks. We do, as everyone is aware, have the note coming due in 2026, but that's an event that we've been planning for and we will continue to plan for. So we are not -- so we expect to remain in the 7% to 9% range.\nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Thank you for the time today, I'll leave it there.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Rich.\nOperator: The next question comes from Paul Zimbardo from Jefferies. please go ahead.\nPaul Zimbardo: Hi, good morning, team. Thanks for taking the call.\nSusan Hardwick: Hey, good morning, Paul.\nCheryl Norton: Good morning.\nPaul Zimbardo: Great. My first question was just if you could unpack a little bit some of the detailed guidance changes within the subcomponents, like in particular, you mentioned that decline -- lower-than-expected decline of customer usage, like how much of that was the guidance raised and just if that carries forward, also there's some moves in like MSG and other. If you could just help unpack some of the more material pieces in the change.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, John can add to it. I just say high-level, Paul, that's really it. We've continued to track customer usage trends pre and post-COVID, and we've certainly expected some measure of customer behavior, and it's probably not tracked quite as we'd expected, and that's really the driver, I think, of what we're seeing so far in results this year and the reason that we've increased our guidance by narrowing the range. John, anything to add there?\nJohn Griffith: If you think about kind of a midpoint to midpoint change, Paul, we're talking about a few cents here. So I think you've -- I think Susan got it right.\nSusan Hardwick: Yes.\nPaul Zimbardo: Okay, great. And then just to follow-up on Durgesh's, Rich's questions about Pennsylvania. Does the commentary about like potentially shift CapEx around also carry to interest in M&A in Pennsylvania? I know it's been kind of a long arduous road and the changes legislative at the commission. Just any change in your views about kind of growing inorganically in Pennsylvania as well?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, as I said, Paul, just a minute ago, I think in response to Rich's question, it really doesn't change our behavior. We've got a very dynamic and robust process in Pennsylvania to identify opportunities. We've got a great team there that's very focused on identifying opportunities and we will continue that. We think that the guidance that the Commission has laid out to analyze these transactions going forward is very helpful. But as I said, it's an environment where multiple parties have opinions relative to these transactions. And so we'll have to see how that continues to play out before the Commission. Again, we think the guidelines are helpful and our part doesn't change in terms of our interest in growing through acquisition in the state of Pennsylvania.\nPaul Zimbardo: Great. Thank you. Very clear. And also congrats again to everyone on the leadership changes.\nSusan Hardwick: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski from Seaport. Please go ahead.\nAngie Storozynski: Thank you. So, just again, I know it was just one decision in Pennsylvania, but I'm wondering, this is the largest rate base for your company. The ROE reduction is quite substantial versus, again, you had a black box settlement that again versus the 10% we were all counting on. So, as you look to the future, I mean, is there an offset to this lower profitability of the largest asset in your portfolio or is it just that you're still within the range and so that's why you're reiterating your growth rate from an earnings perspective?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, Angie, I think it's, again, sort of a good question. First I would just remind folks, and I don't know, back in the back of our deck, we've got detail around rate base on the various jurisdictions. Of course, it changes quickly because we are so active in the regulatory environment, but I think you will see the gap closing from Pennsylvania to some of our other larger states pretty quickly in terms of rate base. We have been making significant investments all across our territory. So while Pennsylvania is large, we have many other states that are gaining ground in terms of size of investment. I think the other answer to your question, though, we addressed in prepared remarks that across our 14 states, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to invest. This need is the same across the country. The need for investment in infrastructure and replacement and resiliency, which I think doesn't get enough of a play. The resiliency issue is a huge one as we see climate changing in different ways in different parts of the country. So we need to continue to focus on our resiliency investment. We have a ton of opportunity across all of our states to deploy capital. So as I said, I think in response to the first question, we don't envision any change in our total capital spending. Where we spend it, we will continue to look at.\nAngie Storozynski: Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Angie.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jonathan Reeder from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Reeder: Hey, good morning, team, and congrats on the management leadership announcements today.\nSusan Hardwick: Good morning, Jonathan.\nJonathan Reeder: I wanted to build on a couple of the questions that have already been asked, but where exactly does that legal challenge related to Butler, stand? And how soon do you think that's going to get resolved by the Commonwealth Court?\nSusan Hardwick: Well, I think that's really it. It's in the court and we're waiting. I don't know that we have a whole lot more to add in terms of timing, mostly because we don't have any idea. I think the court will act when it's prepared to do so. And we are really just at this point waiting on the court's decision.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. But there's no like precedent in terms of how long from the point that the challenge was filed or are you just waiting on the court order or all the processes played out at this point?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, not really. We've looked at that, but we don't really see any definitive pattern here that would give us the ability to kind of predict timing.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. I understand that. On the [indiscernible] deal, I know that's the other kind of large pending one in PA for you. With the fair market value revisions, because that one need to like potentially be recut or what\u2019s the latest thoughts on when that will be filed and potentially approved and closed?\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, it's in limbo, too. John or Cheryl, you want to comment on current status there?\nJohn Griffith: Yes, Jonathan, we're still moving forward with the approval process on [indiscernible] in terms of going to the PUC. So there's no additional update on that.\nJonathan Reeder: Has the filing been made with the PUC or not yet?\nJohn Griffith: Not Yet.\nJonathan Reeder: Not yet.\nJohn Griffith: Okay.\nJonathan Reeder: All right. And then I did want to dive a little deeper into Paul's question earlier about the components like, I saw, there's a 15% increase in the lower end of the revenue. Is that all due to the lower-than-expected declines in customer usage, or was there even more like downside cushion baked into the previous 105 to 125 range around uncertainty related to the PA outcome or something like that?\nSusan Hardwick: John, you want to cover that?\nJohn Griffith: Sure. Jonathan, I think you said it right. We are seeing on the demand side a little bit lower or not as much customer usage decline as we expected to see. And that's a significant driver for the change here.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. And that's lower weather normalized customer usage, right?\nJohn Griffith: Correct.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. What about the long-term financing headwind? I saw the midpoint there came down by like $0.075. Is that it all relate to the pushback and the expected closing dates are like Butler and [indiscernible]? No, the financing, Jonathan, really just relates to the timing of the financings that we've done today. In terms of the convert that we issued last June and then the straight debt that we issued this year.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. So the ...\nSusan Hardwick: Yes, I think that's the bulk of it. There is a little bit of an impact from just the delayed closing on the BASA acquisition too since we have not financed that essentially. So there's a little bit of contribution there too.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. Yes, no, I thought the last time you updated it, you had already done that February $1.4 billion offer. And so I thought that was already wrapped in there.\nSusan Hardwick: Well, we've been sort of waiting on the closing of that for a while. So we probably didn't have fully baked in our expectations around that earlier in the year.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. Thank you for that. And then on the MSG and other, I guess, kind of what caused it to turn into a potential headwind in '24 versus like kind of a $0.05 benefit. Is that something that is kind of ongoing or is it timing-related or \u2026?\nJohn Griffith: No, that's not an ongoing MSG issue. That's just a collection of smaller modest puts and takes that are one-offs.\nJonathan Reeder: Okay. All right. Great. Thank you so much for the time today. I appreciate it.\nSusan Hardwick: Thanks, Jonathan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. The next question comes from Aditya Gandhi from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nAditya Gandhi: Good morning, Susan, Cheryl, and John. Can you hear me?\nSusan Hardwick: We can. Good morning, Aditya.\nAditya Gandhi: Good morning. Congratulations on the leadership updates. I just wanted to follow-up on one of the Pennsylvania questions that was asked earlier as it relates to the lower ROE and your 7% to 9% EPS CAGR. I understand you just reaffirmed it today, but in the interim, while the rate base in your other states picks up, should we be expecting an impact where you're maybe trending towards the lower end of your range in the near term, or are there any other levels or offsets that we should be considering?\nSusan Hardwick: I would say in a word, no. We raised our guidance by narrowing the range to the upper half, and we obviously were taking into account this decision on Pennsylvania. So, no impact, and we reaffirmed our long-term targets.\nAditya Gandhi: Got it. Okay. And have there been any material updates on the PFAS multi-district litigation where you're still waiting for proceeds from some of the defendants there?\nSusan Hardwick: Cheryl, you want to cover that?\nCheryl Norton: Yes, sure. Yes, so we have submitted all of our data that was requested to determine what that payout would be. And now we're just waiting to hear that they've closed that period. It was supposed to close last week. And it could get extended, but we think that the date will hold firm. But now we just have to wait for them to do all the calculations to determine what the payout will be. We don't know for sure when that's going to happen.\nAditya Gandhi: Got it. That's all I had. Thank you.\nOperator: Seeing [ph] that there are no further questions, this concludes our question-and-answer session. The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by saying how excited I am about today's leadership news, and I look forward to working even more closely with our business development team to provide water and wastewater solutions to many more new communities. I'm also very confident that we have the right team for the long-term success of this company. On Slide 9, I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. In Pennsylvania, as Susan just laid out, the commission issued an order in July authorizing an additional $99 million in annualized revenues effective August 7. There are two other items from the order worth noting. The PUC encouraged Pennsylvania American Water to set a target donation to its hardship fund of an additional $1 million. Of note, as part of its acquisition of the Butler Area Sewer Authority, Pennsylvania American Water already committed to increase its shareholder contribution to the H2O Help to Others grant program by $3.5 million over 5 years. As you know, the BASA acquisition was approved by the PUC in November of 2023, but it was appealed to the Commonwealth Court. So the PUC approved expansion of these assistance programs awaits a decision from that court. Regarding the water quality issues raised in the order, we acknowledged that some customers in the Northeast part of our Pennsylvania service area experience temporary aesthetic disturbances associated with system improvements and operational maintenance. Let me be clear. Our water meets all state and federal drinking water regulations. We take customer comments about water quality very seriously and will work with the Commission on the matters raised. As part of this commitment, we attempted personal outreach to every customer who raised a water quality concern during the public hearings to better understand and resolve their issues. With 33 Pennsylvania American Water's water treatment plants nationally recognized with the Director's Awards for participating in the EPA's Partnership for Safe Water. We are fully committed to high-quality, reliable and affordable water and wastewater services. Switching over to Kentucky, the Commission there issued an order on May 3 authorizing an additional $11 million in annualized revenues. Since the company had implemented interim rates effective February 6 based on the requested revenue of $26 million. The order requires a refund with interest to customers retroactive to this date. It does not include the infrastructure surcharge revenues of $10 million, which add to our investment recovery in the state. We filed with the Commission a petition for a rehearing of the rate case order seeking clarification or correction of certain quantifications with respect to the authorized amount of annualized revenues. Of the handful of issues we have raised, the one of most significance appears to be a mathematical error that once corrected would result in a higher revenue requirement. We expect resolution of this proceeding later in 2024. Turning to active cases, you can see we have general rate cases in progress in seven jurisdictions. All of these cases are centered around the capital investments we've made and will continue to make in these states, and all of them are proceeding as we expected. On July 1, we filed a general rate case in Missouri, reflecting a $1.5 billion in system investments, covering January 2023 through May 2026. We are seeking $148 million of additional annual revenue. Rate cases in Missouri usually take up to 11 months, and we expect new rates to become effective mid-2025. In Illinois, the next milestones in the case will be evidentiary hearings in August, followed by briefing from all parties in September, and then a proposed order due in October. In California, we still expect a final rate case decision in the second half of 2024. New rates will be implemented retroactively to January 1, 2024. As a reminder, we reached the partial settlement agreement in November of 2023 with the CPUC's Public Advocates Office, which would address our revenue requirement -- request, but does not address rate design or certain other matters, including our request for continuation of a revenue stability mechanism. Also of note, the California Supreme Court issued a unanimous opinion concluding that the Commission erred when it prohibited water utilities from proposing to continue their water revenue adjustment mechanisms. According -- accordingly, the court vacated the portion of the Commission's 2020 decision relating to this prohibition. Decoupling is a critical tool for conservation efforts in California. Adequate water supply reliability for all uses is essential to the future economic and environmental health of the communities we serve there. In New Jersey, as outlined in the procedural schedule, the company is in confidential settlement discussions among the parties to the proceeding and we hope to have a resolution soon. To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 10 that we have $266 million in annualized new revenues and rates so far in 2024. This includes $176 million from general rate cases and step increases and $90 million from infrastructure surcharges. In total, we have $546 million of total annualized revenue requests pending. Most of the annual authorized revenues we are expecting in 2024, have effective dates which will have a stronger impact on financial results in the second half of the year. Moving to Slide 11, and a topic you've heard us cover just about every quarter, customer affordability. And as we've said, we are very focused on balancing customer affordability and the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. An example of this is included in the Missouri general rate case we filed on July 1st. We are proposing a new income-based discounted rate for customers below 150% of the federal poverty level. We also currently offer assistance through our H2O Help to Others program, which is available to any Missouri American Water customer and meets the basic needs criteria as set by the community action agency caseworkers. We also continue to strongly advocate for a permanent, federally funded, low-income water assistance program similar to what's been in place for many years for gas and electric utility customers and what was temporarily in place for water customers during COVID. Turning to Slide 12. As Susan reviewed earlier, highlighted here is an example of the constructive regulatory and legislative environments we operate in. Our theme here is not only around timely, consistent recovery of investments and operating costs, but also around offering affordability programs and tariffs to those customers who need it the most. As I alluded to earlier, American Water has consistently engaged with policymakers and regulators over the years to find the best ways to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure to serve the long-term best interest of our customers while also achieving timely recovery. When we achieve timely and consistent recovery, it promotes affordability by leveling out customer ability bill impacts over time, making those bills more manageable for our customers. I'd like to point out that we offer affordability programs in most of our states, which is something we have been doing for some time now. We also have specific low income tariffs enacted in four of our biggest states, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois, and West Virginia. And as I mentioned on the last slide, we are seeking to add Missouri to this list once our general rate case concludes next year. Lastly, Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams again did a great job in the quarter executing on our increased capital plan. They safely completed the hundreds of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by almost $200 million in the first half of 2024, compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.1 billion of capital investment in 2024. With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John? Good morning. Yes, sure. Yes, so we have submitted all of our data that was requested to determine what that payout would be. And now we're just waiting to hear that they've closed that period. It was supposed to close last week. And it could get extended, but we think that the date will hold firm. But now we just have to wait for them to do all the calculations to determine what the payout will be. We don't know for sure when that's going to happen."

            "name": "Susan Hardwick",
            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. Let's turn to Slide 5, and I'll start by covering some highlights of the first half of the year. As we announced yesterday, we delivered solid financial results in the second quarter and first half of 2024. Earnings were $1.42 per share for the quarter, compared to $1.44 for the same period last year. In the first 6 months of 2024 and 2023, earnings were $2.37 per share. The results for both periods were in line with our expectations. Our expectations were based on the timing of revenue increases from several general rate case proceedings and infrastructure mechanism filings expected to be effective in the latter half of 2024, which I'll speak more about shortly. With our year-to-date execution and customer usage declines being a bit less than we had planned for so far in 2024, we have raised our 2024 EPS guidance by narrowing it to the top half of the guidance range. Our expectations for 2024 are now $5.25 per share to $5.30 per share. John will share more about our results and guidance a bit later. Moving on to some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2024. We invested $1.4 billion in capital projects year-to-date, again, reflecting great work by our teams responsible for planning and completing these investments. We were also very pleased to add 43,000 customers in our first half of the year from acquisitions and organic growth. Our outlook for future acquisitions remained very strong as we have nearly $500 million in acquisitions under agreement. And earlier this week, we were pleased to publish our company's latest sustainability report for 2023. It reflects how we are fulfilling our mission of providing safe, clean, reliable and affordable water and wastewater service in a very sustainable manner to American Water customers. This has been our mission for over 135 years and counting. Turning to Slide 6 and back to the topic of regulatory recovery, I want to acknowledge the great work of our state and corporate regulatory teams as they continue to successfully execute on our regulatory strategy. We have completed four cases already in 2024 in Indiana, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Pennsylvania, all of which authorized 100% of the capital investments we have made or will make in each state. We also have several other general rate cases and timely infrastructure recovery mechanisms currently in front of regulators that I'm confident will be reasonably decided. Cheryl will provide some additional updates on our active general rate cases a little later. Let's zoom out for a minute, though. I want to remind investors that we strategically choose to operate in a diverse set of regulatory environments that we believe have been and will remain supportive of water and wastewater utility investments and consolidation. As I told you earlier this year, American Water continues to receive tremendous support at the state and federal level for the work that we do across our footprint. Policymakers in our states often understand that historic $20 or $30 per month water bills don't equate to adequately invested systems or the highest quality services for residents. Those relatively low legacy rates often signal significant underinvestment, below average reliability and/or water quality, wastewater overflow issues, or all of the above. That's why policymakers frequently encourage American Water to keep growing, keep investing, and keep solving problems in their states. We often are called on by regulators and policymakers when there is a need for experts to take over a failing community water system. We have a very recent example of just that in the state of Pennsylvania. As you know, we just completed our rate case in Pennsylvania, and the Commission released its order in that case on July 22. It was a case that reflected $1 billion of investment since our last case, which was decided just a short 18 months ago. It's important to note that the Commission approved 100% of the capital invested or to be invested by the end of the future test year of June 30, 2025. There is no dispute about the investments being made and the absolute need for the investment to continue to update our systems to ensure that citizens of Pennsylvania, where we operate, are confident in their water and wastewater service. Certainly, we've received comments about the pace of our regulatory strategy in Pennsylvania. What drives that pace is the need, plain and simple. And of course that pace of investment leads to increased customer bills. We're focused on that issue in every aspect of our regulatory planning and the efforts we continue to drive to ensure customer affordability, from cost management and driving efficiencies, to innovative tariff approaches, to a direct customer assistance. At the end of the day, though, the need for investment is not decreasing. As you assess the recent Pennsylvania order outcome, it's helpful to understand the reconciliation of the order findings to our request. Really there are only two or three things that reconcile the full difference. Recall that we requested a revenue increase of about $200 million and an ROE of 10.95%. An ROE request, which is fully reflective of an increasingly risky business because of higher capital costs, new and emerging regulations, and an increasing need for resiliency, to name just a few of the drivers. The ROE differential between our request and the commission's unprecedented and frankly unsupported finding of 9.45% is $71 million of revenue. Additionally, the Butler Area Sewer Authority acquisition, though fully approved by the commission previously, was removed from the revenue requirement because the transaction is not yet closed. That impact is $23 million of requested revenue. The remaining $11 million delta from our request to the final authorized revenue requirement is made up of a few cost-of-service items. In summary, the order found our request to be fully reasonable, but for the ROE finding. We will continue to be very present in Pennsylvania as we serve our customers, but we will evaluate what is the -- what this result means to our overall allocation of capital investment among our various states. Investors certainly expect a fair return, and it is part of our mission to provide that opportunity while fully serving our customers. Selectively, we believe there is a very long runway of investment opportunities in the communities we serve across our 14 states for organic CapEx and for growth through acquisitions. And further, we believe the regulatory and legislative environments in our 14 states continue to be conducive to earning a fair and reasonable return on the investments we're making and that you, our investors, are counting on. We do all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value of quality service and sustainable operations, which leads us to Slide 7, and what I believe are the drivers of American Water's very competitive and sustainable shareholder return built on the foundation of the regulatory execution I just discussed. This quarter we are again affirming our long-term targets, including both earnings and dividend growth targets at an industry-leading pace of 7% to 9% over the next 5 years and beyond. This affirmation is based on our clear top-tier growth, capital growth plan, and our solid regulatory and operational execution. Our track record of execution on these fronts gives us confidence and should give investors confidence in our ability to achieve our short-term and our long-term financial targets. Finally, let me spend just a few minutes on the leadership news we detailed in our earnings release. I'm excited to release [ph] John has been named President of American Water. This is a decision the American Water Board and I have worked on for some time, and it really is about our intentional effort to build a pipeline of talent through career development to ensure we have a strong leadership foundation for the long-term. With this shift, I will continue to lead the overall strategic direction of our company as the CEO, and as an American Water Board member. John will lead the continued execution of our strategies and daily operations. He will continue to report to me and our Executive Leadership team will report to John. Cheryl will expand her COO role and now lead Business Development. When you consider how she has led our increased capital program, her extensive water quality expertise given the ever-increasing regulations, and her reputation in this industry. This is a natural expansion of her role as we continue to bring solutions to even more communities across the country. David Bowler, who you will hear from next quarter, has been named Executive Vice President and CFO, and Nick Furia has been named Vice President and Treasurer. Let me just say a few words about John, Cheryl, David and Nick, as we are really pleased to have all four expand their roles. You know John well. He has more than 25 years of industry knowledge and expertise and significant experience in leading high-performance teams, strategy development, and execution. Most importantly, he has a deep understanding of our company's purpose and a strong commitment to our customers, employees, and shareholders. Cheryl has more than 35 years of experience and expertise. She has led our lab, served as President in three of our states, and does an incredible job leading all areas of our operations. She, too, has a strong sense of the purpose of American Water. David has nearly 20 years of deep experience in the utility industry and has been our Deputy CFO and Treasurer since 2022. He has significant experience in all aspects of financial management and strategy, including finance strategy and planning, treasury, accounting, enterprise risk and capital markets. And Nick Furia has 10 years of experience with American Water and has served as our Assistant Treasurer since 2021, overseeing key treasury-related functions, including financing, cash flow, liquidity, overall cap structure management. He also served as the Director of Acquisitions at American Water and has nearly 20 years of experience in accounting and finance roles. All have a strong commitment to the success of our company and are well suited for their new and expanded roles. We firmly believe we have further solidified an already top talent leadership team. Our leadership team and the American Water Board of Directors are excited about these changes and highly confident this team will support the execution of our plans now and well into the future. And with that, I'll turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about our recent regulatory updates, affordability and the capital plan. Cheryl? Yes, I think it's a great question. It's obviously something we're going to continue to analyze very closely as we continue to work on our plan update for the fall. But as we said in prepared remarks, the need is not going away. The state of infrastructure and the need for continued focus on improvements and resiliency is not declining in any way, so we know we have investments that need to made in Pennsylvania. We will need to look, though, at how we -- how and how much capital we allocate to the state of Pennsylvania relative to our other states, given this low ROE result in Pennsylvania. It is a real balance of shareholder expectations and the allocation of capital that we really need to think through. Again, we're not going to compromise service. We're not going to compromise safety in any way, but as we think about the pace at which we are making investments, we do have to take into account the return opportunity provided to investors. So I think it's just a question, Durgesh, we're going to have to continue to evaluate a bit, and we'll have more to say about that as we get into sort of our fall planning and updates that we'll provide later in the fall. In total, we don't expect our capital plans to change at all. We again know that the need exists across our entire territory and to the extent we shift dollars from one state to the other should not impact our total expectations. Thanks, Rich. Yes, again, I think there's so many opportunities in all of our states really from a acquisition growth perspective and we know we've got a great pipeline in Pennsylvania, a lot of good opportunities there and our team continues to work very, very hard to identify those opportunities and move them all along. And we're not going to slow that pace at all. I think if there's a pace issue at all in Pennsylvania, it will really be around just the environment-related to fair market value and the commission's process they put in place to review acquisitions, which we think, by the way, is very positive. We think the approach the commission has taken there to really put some guidelines around looking at acquisitions and benefits being provided to customers we think will be helpful. But it's still a difficult environment to get those transactions across the finish line. So again, our view is we don't change anything about what we're doing. We'll see how the process works with all the parties involved in those types of proceedings and how the commission handles all of that through the approval process. Yes, I'll probably turn to John on that. John, you want to comment there? Thanks, Rich. Hey, good morning, Paul. Yes, John can add to it. I just say high-level, Paul, that's really it. We've continued to track customer usage trends pre and post-COVID, and we've certainly expected some measure of customer behavior, and it's probably not tracked quite as we'd expected, and that's really the driver, I think, of what we're seeing so far in results this year and the reason that we've increased our guidance by narrowing the range. John, anything to add there? Yes. Yes, as I said, Paul, just a minute ago, I think in response to Rich's question, it really doesn't change our behavior. We've got a very dynamic and robust process in Pennsylvania to identify opportunities. We've got a great team there that's very focused on identifying opportunities and we will continue that. We think that the guidance that the Commission has laid out to analyze these transactions going forward is very helpful. But as I said, it's an environment where multiple parties have opinions relative to these transactions. And so we'll have to see how that continues to play out before the Commission. Again, we think the guidelines are helpful and our part doesn't change in terms of our interest in growing through acquisition in the state of Pennsylvania. Great. Thank you. Yes, Angie, I think it's, again, sort of a good question. First I would just remind folks, and I don't know, back in the back of our deck, we've got detail around rate base on the various jurisdictions. Of course, it changes quickly because we are so active in the regulatory environment, but I think you will see the gap closing from Pennsylvania to some of our other larger states pretty quickly in terms of rate base. We have been making significant investments all across our territory. So while Pennsylvania is large, we have many other states that are gaining ground in terms of size of investment. I think the other answer to your question, though, we addressed in prepared remarks that across our 14 states, we have a lot of opportunity to continue to invest. This need is the same across the country. The need for investment in infrastructure and replacement and resiliency, which I think doesn't get enough of a play. The resiliency issue is a huge one as we see climate changing in different ways in different parts of the country. So we need to continue to focus on our resiliency investment. We have a ton of opportunity across all of our states to deploy capital. So as I said, I think in response to the first question, we don't envision any change in our total capital spending. Where we spend it, we will continue to look at. Thanks, Angie. Good morning, Jonathan. Well, I think that's really it. It's in the court and we're waiting. I don't know that we have a whole lot more to add in terms of timing, mostly because we don't have any idea. I think the court will act when it's prepared to do so. And we are really just at this point waiting on the court's decision. Yes, not really. We've looked at that, but we don't really see any definitive pattern here that would give us the ability to kind of predict timing. Yes, it's in limbo, too. John or Cheryl, you want to comment on current status there? John, you want to cover that? Yes, I think that's the bulk of it. There is a little bit of an impact from just the delayed closing on the BASA acquisition too since we have not financed that essentially. So there's a little bit of contribution there too. Well, we've been sort of waiting on the closing of that for a while. So we probably didn't have fully baked in our expectations around that earlier in the year. Thanks, Jonathan. We can. Good morning, Aditya. I would say in a word, no. We raised our guidance by narrowing the range to the upper half, and we obviously were taking into account this decision on Pennsylvania. So, no impact, and we reaffirmed our long-term targets. Cheryl, you want to cover that?"

            "name": "John Griffith",
            "content": "Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. I, too, look forward to all of our new roles. We have a great future ahead of us and much work to do as we continue to make communities stronger through the essential water and wastewater services we provide. Turning to Slide 15, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $1.42 per share for the quarter, down $0.02 per share versus the same period in 2023, but up $0.02 per share on a weather-normalized basis. Recently completed rate cases in Indiana, West Virginia, and Kentucky, in addition to rate outcomes achieved last year, are driving increased revenues. While weather led to a net unfavorable impact on earnings quarter-over-quarter of an estimated $0.04 per share, earnings in the second quarter of 2024 were favorably impacted by an estimated $0.03 per share of weather due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in New Jersey, while earnings were favorably impacted in Q2 of 2023 by an estimated $0.07 per share of weather due to warm and dry conditions, primarily in Missouri, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. And looking at operating costs, increased employee-related costs caused O&M to increase $0.03 per share, as expected, from normal wage increases somewhat offset by lower headcount. Production costs related to fuel, power, and chemicals costs were flat compared to this period in 2023. Next, depreciation increased $0.07 per share, and long-term financing costs increased $0.11 per share, both as expected, in support of our investment growth. Long-term financing costs include interest on the $1 billion convertible note issuance from last June and the $1.4 billion long-term senior note issuance this February. And finally, we had $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS. We will continue to break this out quarterly so investors will be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from its core regulated strategy without this additional interest income. Turning to Slide 16, earnings were flat for the year-to-date period compared to the same period last year, driven by many of the same factors as in the second quarter. On a weather-normalized basis, earnings have increased $0.04 per share year-to-date, which as Susan mentioned, is in line with our expectations for the first half of the year. Turning to our discussion of growth through acquisitions, on Slide 17 you'll see that we successfully closed on five systems for $119 million through June 30, which added approximately 33,400 new customers. The newest additions include the water and wastewater systems in Salem, New Jersey, and Cape Charles, Virginia, which followed the Granite City, Illinois, Wastewater Treatment Plant acquisition we closed in Q1. We've also added 9,600 customers through organic growth through June 30. We continue to be well-positioned for strong growth through acquisitions, with 59,000 customer connections and $483 million under agreement as of quarter end. Many states in our footprint are contributing to this total, which mirrors the broad-based pipeline of opportunities we have in progress across the country. As a reminder, we have received PUC approval for the acquisition of the 15,000-customer BASA wastewater system in Pennsylvania. The PUC's approval is under appeal, and we await a decision from the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court to proceed with closing. On June 13, the Pennsylvania Commission voted to adopt revisions to procedures around Act 12 fair market value. The provisions in this final order were largely the same as the proposed version we covered on the first quarter call. And as we said on the first quarter call, we believe these provisions are a constructive step for continued consolidation in Pennsylvania as they reaffirm the core principles of Act 12. We do expect the closing of current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline. Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial position. Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of June 30, net of our $48 million of cash on hand as 56%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%. And finally, on Slide 19, yesterday we announced that we are raising our 2024 EPS guidance by narrowing it to the top half of the range we first disclosed in February. The 2024 EPS guidance range is now $5.25 to $5.30, from $5.20 to $5.30 previously, and still on a weather-normalized basis. As Susan mentioned, this change is driven by lower-than-expected declines in customer usage, which is something we track closely and now believe we can count on for the remainder of the year. Coupled with the fact that we have several revenue increases effective in Q2 and Q3, we expect second half 2024 will deliver financial results to achieve this narrow guidance range. This puts us on track to deliver 8.5% EPS growth in 2024 at the new midpoint. Our high-level outlook for 2024 otherwise remains unchanged from what we previously disclosed, and we again affirm our long-term financial targets. We believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth, coupled with our affordability position and DSG leadership, will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and our position as the largest and most geographically diversified water and wastewater utility in the country distinguish us from all other utilities. With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator to begin Q&A. Good morning, Durgesh. Thanks. Thanks, Durgesh. Rich, not lumpiness. So we maintain our 7% to 9% long-term growth. We've been asked a question in the past off of what base year? We don't pick a base year. As you know, we came out of a transition in 2021 selling HOS, selling New York. That was '21 to '22, '22 to '23, we were inside of the 7% to 9%. We expect to be this year. And we frankly think our goal is that it shouldn't matter a lot what year somebody picks. We do, as everyone is aware, have the note coming due in 2026, but that's an event that we've been planning for and we will continue to plan for. So we are not -- so we expect to remain in the 7% to 9% range. If you think about kind of a midpoint to midpoint change, Paul, we're talking about a few cents here. So I think you've -- I think Susan got it right. Yes, Jonathan, we're still moving forward with the approval process on [indiscernible] in terms of going to the PUC. So there's no additional update on that. Not Yet. Okay. Sure. Jonathan, I think you said it right. We are seeing on the demand side a little bit lower or not as much customer usage decline as we expected to see. And that's a significant driver for the change here. Correct. No, that's not an ongoing MSG issue. That's just a collection of smaller modest puts and takes that are one-offs."

As a reminder, this call is being recorded and is also being live webcast with an accompanying slide presentation through the company's Investor Relations website. The audio webcast archive will be available for 1 year on American Water's Investor Relations website.  \n I would now like to introduce your host for today's call, Aaron Musgrave, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Musgrave, you may begin. \nAaron Musgrave: Thank you, Betsy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today's call. At the end of our prepared remarks, we will open the call for your questions. Let me first go over some safe harbor language. Today, we will be making forward-looking statements that represent our expectations regarding our future performance or other future events. These statements are predictions based on our current expectations, estimates and assumptions. However, since these statements deal with future events, they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from the results indicated or implied by such statements. \n Additional information regarding these risks, uncertainties and factors as well as a more detailed analysis of our financials and other important information is provided in the first quarter earnings release and in our March 31 Form 10-Q, each filed yesterday with the SEC.  And finally, all statements during this presentation related to earnings and earnings per share referred to diluted earnings and diluted earnings per share. After our prepared remarks, we'll then close by answering your questions.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to American Water's President and CEO, Susan Hardwick. \nM. Hardwick: Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we started 2024 with solid financial results. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter compared to $0.91 last year. The increased results were as we expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we are pleased to affirm.  First quarter 2024 results included $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS, which reflected the higher interest rate and the successful earn-out of the $75 million contingent consideration as we detailed in our February call. Here, you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2024, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks.  \n As we announced in late February, we completed a successful long-term debt issuance of $1.4 billion. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2024 financing plan. We also invested well over $600 million of capital in infrastructure this quarter. In addition, we completed a large acquisition and filed general rate cases in several states in accordance with the traditional process of earning a return on the capital investments we have made. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value for quality service and sustainable operations, which we highlighted in our disclosures we published in early April as noted on this slide.  \n The other significant news so far in 2024 for us and the water industry as a whole came on April 10 when the EPA announced the final national primary drinking water regulations for 6 PFAS chemicals. Cheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS water quality standards, but I want to reiterate that we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality.  I want to again assure our customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise to tackle this issue head on. And in fact, we have demonstrated that in many locations for some time now.  \n Turning to Slide 6. This quarter, we again -- we are, again, affirming our long-term targets for both earnings and dividend growth at 7% to 9%. This affirmation is based upon clear top-tier capital growth plan and our strong regulatory and operational execution that I believe is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long-term plans, growing earnings and dividends at an industry-leading pace over the next 5 years and beyond. \n Moving on to Slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.7075 per share to $0.765 per share, an 8.1% increase. We have grown our dividend consistently over the last 5 years, significantly outpacing virtually all of our utility peers, while maintaining a consistent payout ratio of less than 60%.  Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to our investors.  \n And with that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about PFAS, recent regulatory updates, affordability and rate base growth. Cheryl? \nCheryl Norton: Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to Slide 9 and reviewing the U.S. EPA's drinking water rule on PFAS published in April. As Susan stated, we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges that the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability.  We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the U.S. water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges. EPA's final rule was unchanged in terms of the drinking water limit of 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS. However, the federal timeline to comply was extended from 3 years to 5 years in the final rule.  The federal compliance window now includes the 2-year extension that states would have been allowed to grant the water systems for capital improvements. \n As always, we will work with our state regulators to incorporate any additional state specific guidance related to implementing the new federal rule, including maximum contaminant level guidelines. Based upon our preliminary analysis of this new PFAS rule and assuming states don't adopt more stringent limits, we currently do not anticipate any change to our estimate of $1 billion of capital and our estimate of up to $50 million annually of operating expenses to comply with the rule.  We also do not currently expect the new limits set by the EPA for 3 additional PFAS compounds to impact these estimates. \n Through a separate rule-making in April, U.S. EPA also designated PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances under CERCLA. As a reminder, we continue to actively advocate and support bipartisan federal legislation that would provide PFAS liability protections under CERCLA for water and wastewater systems as passive receivers of PFAS.  Previously, we've disclosed that we remained a party to 2 settlements so far with 3M and DuPont coming out of the multi-district litigation, or MDL lawsuit. As we shared, we believe this is the best path to recouping the most dollars possible from PFAS manufacturers in an expedient manner for our customers. The MDL Court issued its final approval of the DuPont and 3M settlements in February and March of this year, respectively. The amount of proceeds to be received from each settlement is still pending.  \n Turning to Slide 10. I'll cover the latest regulatory activity in our states. In West Virginia, the Commission issued an order authorizing an additional $18 million in annualized revenues effective February 25. We also received an order for $7 million of additional revenue related to our DSIC request, effective March 1.  In Indiana, the Commission issued an order authorizing an additional $66 million in annualized revenues effective over a phased 3-step process through May 2025. They also approved a new rate design that provides 1,500 gallons of water usage at no additional cost above the fixed monthly customer charge for all water customers. The change will allow Indiana American to provide low-cost basic water service for customers on fixed incomes that use a lower volume of water than the typical residential customer. With this change, the cost for the typical residential water customer using 1,500 gallons will be approximately $20 per month. This is just one example of the many innovative ways we are addressing customer affordability.  \n Turning to active cases. You can see we have general rate cases in progress in 8 jurisdictions. All of these cases are centered around the capital investments we've made and will continue to make in these states. Our cases in California, Virginia, New Jersey and Illinois are progressing well as expected. In Illinois, the next milestones in the case will be staff and intervenor testimony in May, followed by our rebuttal in June. In New Jersey, the next milestones in the case will be staff and intervenor testimony in July, followed by our rebuttal in September and evidentiary hearings in October.  In Kentucky, we expect an order any day now as the story deadline for the Commission to act is May 7. Interim rates in Kentucky were implemented on February 6. \n In Pennsylvania, we expect new rates to be effective in August for the case we filed last year that was driven by $1 billion of vital capital investment. The next milestones expected in the case are a proposed decision from the ALJ likely in May and a final order in July. We expect a constructive outcome that reflects the State of Pennsylvania's long-standing support for needed capital investment that improves infrastructure for the benefit of customers.  And finally, on the rate case front, just yesterday, we filed general rate cases in Iowa and Tennessee. And last week, we filed notice with the Missouri Public Service Commission that we plan to file a case by midyear. \n On the legislative front, 3 state bills were passed and signed that will incrementally help water utilities in those states in the areas of lead service line replacements, expediency of approval of smaller acquisitions and fire hydrant maintenance.  To show the magnitude of our regulatory execution efforts, you can see on Slide 11 that we have $98 million in annualized new revenues in rates since January. This includes $43 million from general rate cases and step increases and $55 million from infrastructure surcharges. In total, we have $636 million of total annualized revenue request pending.  \n Moving to Slide 12 and a topic you've heard us cover just about every quarter, customer affordability. As we've said, we are very focused on balancing customer affordability and the magnitude of the system investments that are needed. Our industry and our company are in very good relative positions in terms of affordability or wallet share. Our system-wide average residential water customer bill is $55 to $65 per month. The investment plan we have in place will allow us to stay within our consolidated target for residential water bills of 1% or less of median household income. That analysis is supported by U.S. Census Bureau data specific to the geographies we serve that project rising levels of median household income in these communities. \n At the same time, we realize we must continue to involve our strategies around rate design and programs to assist our customers who are challenged with affordability, as I described earlier, with what we're doing in Indiana as an example. As another example, just last month, California American Water announced an additional $8 million in bill relief for customers who faced financial hardship due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding comes through a California program that utilizes Federal American Rescue Plan Act funds. This brings the total benefit for challenged California American Water customers to $15 million under the program. We also continue to strongly advocate for a permanent federally funded low-income water assistance program, similar to what's been in place for many years for electric and gas utility customers. And we are continuing our focus on technology, efficiencies of scale and cost management to deliver on customer affordability especially as regulatory demand such as the final PFAS rule and the proposed lead and copper rule improvement increased capital needs.  \n Lastly, Slide 13 shows that our state and corporate leaders and their teams did a great job in the first quarter, executing on our increased capital plan. It required significant effort to safely and efficiently deliver the hundreds of projects that improved our systems and drove capital investment higher by almost $200 million in the quarter, compared to the same period last year. This result keeps us on pace to hit our goal of approximately $3.1 billion of capital investment in 2024.  The pie charts on the right side of the page speak to timely recovery and the nature of our investments across our footprint. As we share with regulators and legislators, our capital spending is driven by a risk-based strategy, balanced by a focus on affordability. For us, infrastructure renewal includes the basics of replacing older damaged pipe, but it also includes proactively meeting our standards related to lead service line replacements. \n As we have said many times before, we firmly believe removing the risk of lead service lines over time is the right thing to do for the health and safety of our customers.  Through capital recovery mechanisms and forward test years, we can reduce regulatory lag and lessen the reliance on general rate cases. This not only helps us to seek to earn our allowed return, but also to mitigate the size of general rate increases for our customers. We expect at least 75% of capital investments over the next 5 years to be recoverable through infrastructure mechanisms and through the use of forward test years, which is the key to driving modest bill increases and to unlocking a more consistent annual earnings growth pattern for the long term.  \n With that, I'll hand it over to John to cover our financial results and plans in further detail. John? \nJohn Griffith: Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 15, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2023. As Cheryl mentioned, we have completed rate cases recently in Indiana and West Virginia in addition to rate outcomes achieved last year and we are seeing increased revenues as a result.  And looking at O&M, production costs from increased fuel, power and chemicals as well as increased employee-related costs caused O&M to increase $0.07 per share. \n Next, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and long-term financing costs increased $0.11 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth. Long-term financing costs include interest on the $1 billion convertible note we issued last June and the $1.4 billion long-term senior note issued in February along with $0.04 of dilution related to the $1.7 billion of equity we issued last March.  Short-term financing provided a benefit of $0.07 per share, primarily from interest earned on the cash reserves we held during the quarter. Other net consists of net unfavorable onetime nonoperating items year-over-year. And finally, as Susan mentioned, we had $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS.  \n We will continue to break this out quarterly, so our investors will be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from our core regulated strategy without this additional interest income.  \n On Slide 16, you'll see that we successfully closed on the Granite City, Illinois Wastewater Treatment Plant acquisition in the first quarter. This acquisition will help ensure we can provide high-quality service to the customers in Granite City we already serve. We continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions with over 60,000 customer connections and over $500 million under agreement as of quarter end. Many states in our footprint are contributing to this total, which mirrors the broad-based pipeline of opportunities we have in progress across the country.  Of the over 60,000 customers represented by signed agreements, nearly 20,000 have already been approved by the State Public Utility Commission. This includes the 15,000 customers in the Butler Area Sewer Authority, or BASA Wastewater System acquisition in Pennsylvania. We continue to expect BASA to close in the near future. This also includes the water and wastewater systems in Cape Charles, Virginia, which we closed just last week and marked the second acquisition completed under Virginia's fair market value law enacted in 2020. We look forward to serving our new Cape Charles customers.  \n As we've discussed before and as we lay out on this slide, the environment in Pennsylvania related to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive. We are very confident that the core principles of the original Act 12, fair market value law, will remain in place and continue to have good support since so much consolidation is still needed in Pennsylvania to address the underinvestment in infrastructure. In the meantime, closing of current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline.  We are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania driven by the need for system consolidation and upgrading all for the benefit of communities who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service.  \n Slide 17 summarizes our successful long-term debt financing completed in February. The offering was for $1.4 billion and included $700 million of 10-year notes at 5.15% and $700 million of 30-year notes at 5.45%. Our treasury team did a very nice job proactively executing on our main financing plan objective for the year amidst a challenging interest rate environment. These proceeds will fund our regulated businesses' growth and were used to pay off a maturing senior note and outstanding commercial paper of which we had a zero balance at quarter end.  Though the current higher interest rate environment is challenging, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with the challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances, and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the benefit of our customers and shareholders.  \n And finally, Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition. In March, S&P affirmed our solid single A investment-grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio, which followed Moody's affirmation of its rating and outlook for us in January. We are confident our FFO to debt ratio will continue to support our current credit ratings.  Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of March 31 net of our $584 million of cash on hand is 56%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%.  \n In closing, what you've heard today should sound very familiar. Our focus is on execution at every level. We believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and strategy separate us from all other utilities. And our execution includes the outstanding efforts by our Military Services Group to proudly serve the 18 military installations in our footprint.  \n With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator and take any questions you may have. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Richard Sunderland with JPMorgan. \nRichard Sunderland: Can you hear me? \nM. Hardwick: Yes, we can. \nRichard Sunderland: Great. First, I want to start on the Pennsylvania front. With the rate case, curious about the path forward and if settlement is still an option or if litigating is just the path to close out? And then separately, on Pennsylvania, the fair market value revisions, do you see that 1.68 cap limiting willingness to sell at all? \nM. Hardwick: Yes. Good questions, Rich. I think first on the rate case, I would say probably just where we are in the process. I'd say settlement is probably unlikely at this stage. And as Cheryl, I think, outlined, we would expect some activity by the Commission here in the next probably several weeks, and then we'll wrap that case up later in the summer. So I don't expect to settle at this point. And again, we're pleased with where we are in the process related to that case. \n On fair market value, lots going on, obviously there, and we'll continue to watch those activities. And obviously, we're involved in discussions around any potential changes that may get made. I think in terms of what impact some of those changes may have on community's interest in selling, I think it's just wait and see. I think so many of these communities need the help, and we're quite confident in our ability to help them. And I think our focus always is on coming up with the right solution for these communities, and we'll continue to do that. So we'll certainly work with whatever framework that is provided to us by regulators and legislators in this respect. \nRichard Sunderland: Got it. Appreciate the commentary there. And then separately, on Slide 9, the latest around these new circular designations, curious how you view litigation risk under these new classifications or anything we should be thinking about on the litigation front, given the commentary around the liability protections that you also referenced? \nM. Hardwick: Yes. And Cheryl certainly can weigh in here too. I think our view is we'll continue to be proactive here in trying to get resolution to a CERCLA designation. But we're also just confident in our ability to execute our plan here to be compliant with the rules. We've been doing it for some time in many of our jurisdictions already. So we're quite confident in our plans and don't expect this to be a huge risk for us. Cheryl, anything you want to add? \nCheryl Norton: Yes, I would just add that we're working really hard on the legislative front to get the language fixed so that we are protected from those CERCLA rules, and we'll continue down that path. We've had lots of conversations with EPA around this, and their intent is not for us to be impacted by that, but those conversations will continue until we get to a solution that we're all really comfortable with. \nOperator: The next question comes from Angie Storozynski with Seaport. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: I do want to go back to Pennsylvania rate case. I understand the sensitivity around it, but there are just a number of issues raised in it by I mean many intervenors, the commission itself about how often you file rate cases, the allowed ROE? I mean you guys mentioned a number of other rate cases that seem to be going smoothly, but I'm just wondering if there's -- if there are any thoughts about a change in the strategy of still how often you file rate cases, any impact of these comments that you're seeing on the level of capital investments, especially in Pennsylvania. Again, I don't think that we've ever seen filings like these in Pennsylvania. \nM. Hardwick: Yes, Angie, it's a good question. And again, we remain very confident in our plans, both in terms of how we execute them and the regulatory process that supports the work that we're doing in the State of Pennsylvania. There's just tremendous need in the State of Pennsylvania as there is in many of the jurisdictions that we operate in. So our focus on investment is really around the need for infrastructure improvement and we'll continue to do that work. I think the Pennsylvania case is a great example of that. We spent over $1 billion or will have spent over $1 billion in that case, and it's all focused on rate base growth. It is all focused on infrastructure renewal and replacement and the necessary work to be done in the State of Pennsylvania to bring these systems up to appropriate standards so that we can consistently provide safe and reliable water service. \n So we're -- again, we remain very confident in our plan and our ability to navigate the regulatory arena. And there is, of course, some observation around the speed with which we're filing these cases, and I think it is directly tied to the pace of our spend. We've really increased the level of spend, again, driven by the need. And when you really look at the time line of this case, it's really not much different than other water peers in the state of Pennsylvania. We may be ahead just a bit by than our nearest competitor in the state, but not by much in terms of pace. And so I don't think it's that unusual. And again, it's all driven by the need for investment and the work that we're doing to improve the quality of service in the State of Pennsylvania. \nAgnieszka Storozynski: Okay. And then just one other point, which is being mentioned is the inclusion of a pending acquisition in that rate case. I thought that, that's happened in the past. So I'm a little bit surprised that this is a point that is being raised. And I'm wondering if this has anything to do with the changes that are happening to Act 12. You guys referenced that it could take longer for to get regulatory approvals for some of these pending acquisitions. And I'm assuming that, that is in response to those questions being raised in this rate case. But I'm just wondering, again, going forward, how do you expect actually these many deals to be approved or reflected in rates? \nM. Hardwick: Yes. I think it's probably a fair assumption to say that all of this is getting a bit tied together. The landscape around the potential legislative changes in fair market value, I think, do sort of spill over into the rate case analysis a bit. And to be clear, we included in this case, acquisitions that we have approved and expected to close during this period of time. And so as the commission sorts through that, obviously, they've got to take into consideration the status of those acquisitions and their findings in the case, which we would fully expect them to do. \n I think on a go-forward basis, we wouldn't expect there to be really any change in how we consider acquisitions in future rate cases. \nOperator: The next question comes from Gregg Orrill with UBS. \nGregg Orrill: More of a general question just in might have covered this before, but on sort of the impact of with so many discussions are around these days, just data center presence and how that impacts your growth and any constraints that, that has on your business? \nM. Hardwick: Yes, it's a good question. Cheryl, you want to talk about any preliminary thoughts we have about potential water usage in some of these large data center moves. \nCheryl Norton: Yes, Gregg, we haven't seen a big uptake in the amount of water that our customers are asking for related to the data center moves at all. So we're thinking that's a minimal impact for us unlike our electric utility peers. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Aditya Gandhi with Wolfe Research. \nAditya Gandhi: Can you hear me? \nM. Hardwick: We can. \nAditya Gandhi: Just on the PFAS legislation that you're advocating for, could you give us some color on whether it's attached to other related bills? And if there's any sort of milestones we should be watching for there? And then could you also just explain what steps you're taking to sort of secure support on both sides of the aisle as it relates to legislation. \nM. Hardwick: Sure. Yes. Cheryl, do you want to take that? \nCheryl Norton: Yes, sure. So there has been legislation filed both on the Senate and the House side that it's the Water Systems PFAS Liability Act. On the house side, it's 7944 and I'm trying to see -- I don't have the Senate number, but this act would help protect us along with some other industries as a passive receiver and so we work really hard on both sides of the aisle all the time to connect with our legislators and also educate them on the real issues at hand. We've had some really great conversations on the Hill and are hopeful that this still will continue to move forward both in the House and the Senate, so that we can push this forward. And I think you would just watch for the key things like getting out of committee, getting a floor vote. And so we'll continue to push that forward and update you in these calls as things unfold there. \nM. Hardwick: And Cheryl, it is stand-alone, right? There's nothing else defined. \nCheryl Norton: Yes. It's not tied to anything else except to try to protect passive users or passive receivers from this liability. \nAditya Gandhi: Right. That's helpful. And maybe just 1 follow-up there. Is there a particular timeline by which you're expecting this legislation to either pass or by when -- by when should we know whether this thing is going to pass or not? \nCheryl Norton: Yes. I think it's impossible to anticipate the timeline. We would love to say it will be all completed by the next couple of months, but it could take much longer. The political process is really challenging at times. So we think we've got good support, and we'll continue to push on it as fast as we can, but there's just no timeline for it. \nM. Hardwick: We do think it probably helps a bit that we now have the final rules out. We've been working on this particular angle for quite some time even before the final rule was published. So now that the final rule is here, that sort of eliminates one reason why legislators didn't want to take this issue up. If they were waiting to see what the final rule was, and that was sort of an excuse to not address this issue, I think that's been removed from their list of reasons not to move. So hopefully, that helps, and we'll see continued movement here. \nCheryl Norton: Yes. And in addition, the EPA said that they want to be able to use discretion. So part of this is some discretionary flexibility for them because they did not intend by designating these compounds as hazardous substances that it would apply to water and wastewater utilities. So they're planning to use discretion, but we think it's a much tighter protection to have this legislation. So we'll continue to pursue that in addition to working with EPA. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. That concludes our conference call today. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Cheryl Norton",
            "content": "Thanks, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Let me start by turning to Slide 9 and reviewing the U.S. EPA's drinking water rule on PFAS published in April. As Susan stated, we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality. These contaminants are among the multiple challenges that the water industry faces regarding water quality, quantity and reliability.  We remain steadfast in our commitment to be a leader in the U.S. water and wastewater industry and a provider of solutions to these challenges. EPA's final rule was unchanged in terms of the drinking water limit of 4 parts per trillion for PFOA and PFOS. However, the federal timeline to comply was extended from 3 years to 5 years in the final rule.

            "content": "Thank you, Cheryl, and good morning, everyone. Turning to Slide 15, I'll provide some further insights into our financial results for the quarter. Earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter, up $0.04 per share versus the same period in 2023. As Cheryl mentioned, we have completed rate cases recently in Indiana and West Virginia in addition to rate outcomes achieved last year and we are seeing increased revenues as a result.  And looking at O&M, production costs from increased fuel, power and chemicals as well as increased employee-related costs caused O&M to increase $0.07 per share. \n Next, depreciation increased $0.06 per share and long-term financing costs increased $0.11 per share, both as expected in support of our investment growth. Long-term financing costs include interest on the $1 billion convertible note we issued last June and the $1.4 billion long-term senior note issued in February along with $0.04 of dilution related to the $1.7 billion of equity we issued last March.  Short-term financing provided a benefit of $0.07 per share, primarily from interest earned on the cash reserves we held during the quarter. Other net consists of net unfavorable onetime nonoperating items year-over-year. And finally, as Susan mentioned, we had $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS.  \n We will continue to break this out quarterly, so our investors will be able to track the ongoing growth of American Water from our core regulated strategy without this additional interest income.  \n On Slide 16, you'll see that we successfully closed on the Granite City, Illinois Wastewater Treatment Plant acquisition in the first quarter. This acquisition will help ensure we can provide high-quality service to the customers in Granite City we already serve. We continue to be set up for strong growth through acquisitions with over 60,000 customer connections and over $500 million under agreement as of quarter end. Many states in our footprint are contributing to this total, which mirrors the broad-based pipeline of opportunities we have in progress across the country.  Of the over 60,000 customers represented by signed agreements, nearly 20,000 have already been approved by the State Public Utility Commission. This includes the 15,000 customers in the Butler Area Sewer Authority, or BASA Wastewater System acquisition in Pennsylvania. We continue to expect BASA to close in the near future. This also includes the water and wastewater systems in Cape Charles, Virginia, which we closed just last week and marked the second acquisition completed under Virginia's fair market value law enacted in 2020. We look forward to serving our new Cape Charles customers.  \n As we've discussed before and as we lay out on this slide, the environment in Pennsylvania related to acquisitions is undergoing change, which we think is ultimately necessary and positive. We are very confident that the core principles of the original Act 12, fair market value law, will remain in place and continue to have good support since so much consolidation is still needed in Pennsylvania to address the underinvestment in infrastructure. In the meantime, closing of current pending transactions will likely take more time than usual, but to be clear, we are confident in our Pennsylvania acquisition pipeline.  We are continuing to invest in regulated acquisition opportunities in Pennsylvania driven by the need for system consolidation and upgrading all for the benefit of communities who deserve safe and reliable water and wastewater service.  \n Slide 17 summarizes our successful long-term debt financing completed in February. The offering was for $1.4 billion and included $700 million of 10-year notes at 5.15% and $700 million of 30-year notes at 5.45%. Our treasury team did a very nice job proactively executing on our main financing plan objective for the year amidst a challenging interest rate environment. These proceeds will fund our regulated businesses' growth and were used to pay off a maturing senior note and outstanding commercial paper of which we had a zero balance at quarter end.  Though the current higher interest rate environment is challenging, we are in a position of strength on a number of fronts in dealing with the challenge. Our strategy of issuing debt at the holding company level allows us to take advantage of our scale and pricing debt issuances, and we will remain proactive in managing risk and achieving a low cost of capital to the benefit of our customers and shareholders.  \n And finally, Slide 18 is a summary of our continued strong financial condition. In March, S&P affirmed our solid single A investment-grade credit rating and stable outlook and noted our improved FFO to debt ratio, which followed Moody's affirmation of its rating and outlook for us in January. We are confident our FFO to debt ratio will continue to support our current credit ratings.  Our total debt-to-capital ratio as of March 31 net of our $584 million of cash on hand is 56%, which is comfortably within our long-term target of less than 60%.  \n In closing, what you've heard today should sound very familiar. Our focus is on execution at every level. We believe our industry-leading EPS and dividend growth and ESG leadership will continue to be highly valued and rewarded by investors. We believe these aspects of our business and strategy separate us from all other utilities. And our execution includes the outstanding efforts by our Military Services Group to proudly serve the 18 military installations in our footprint.  \n With that, I'll turn it back over to our operator and take any questions you may have."

            "content": "Thanks, Aaron. Good morning, everyone. As we announced yesterday, we started 2024 with solid financial results. As shown on Slide 5, earnings were $0.95 per share for the quarter compared to $0.91 last year. The increased results were as we expected and put us on track to achieve our full year earnings guidance, which we are pleased to affirm.  First quarter 2024 results included $0.02 per share of additional interest income from the February 2024 amendment of the seller note related to the sale of HOS, which reflected the higher interest rate and the successful earn-out of the $75 million contingent consideration as we detailed in our February call. Here, you can also see a recap of some of our other key accomplishments so far in 2024, and John and Cheryl will add to these in their remarks.  \n As we announced in late February, we completed a successful long-term debt issuance of $1.4 billion. This delivered on the highest priority in our 2024 financing plan. We also invested well over $600 million of capital in infrastructure this quarter. In addition, we completed a large acquisition and filed general rate cases in several states in accordance with the traditional process of earning a return on the capital investments we have made. We did all of this while keeping customer bills affordable and staying true to our high value for quality service and sustainable operations, which we highlighted in our disclosures we published in early April as noted on this slide.  \n The other significant news so far in 2024 for us and the water industry as a whole came on April 10 when the EPA announced the final national primary drinking water regulations for 6 PFAS chemicals. Cheryl will elaborate further on the PFAS water quality standards, but I want to reiterate that we fully support the EPA's efforts to protect drinking water quality.  I want to again assure our customers, regulators, investors and other stakeholders that American Water has the expertise to tackle this issue head on. And in fact, we have demonstrated that in many locations for some time now.  \n Turning to Slide 6. This quarter, we again -- we are, again, affirming our long-term targets for both earnings and dividend growth at 7% to 9%. This affirmation is based upon clear top-tier capital growth plan and our strong regulatory and operational execution that I believe is a positive differentiator from our peers. As we've done in the past, we expect to consistently deliver on our annual and long-term plans, growing earnings and dividends at an industry-leading pace over the next 5 years and beyond. \n Moving on to Slide 7. As we announced yesterday, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend from $0.7075 per share to $0.765 per share, an 8.1% increase. We have grown our dividend consistently over the last 5 years, significantly outpacing virtually all of our utility peers, while maintaining a consistent payout ratio of less than 60%.  Looking ahead, we continue to expect to grow our dividend at 7% to 9% per year on average, which is in line with our compelling 7% to 9% EPS growth target. Our Board and management team understand and appreciate how important the dividend component of our total shareholder return is to our investors.  \n And with that, let me turn it over to Cheryl to talk more about PFAS, recent regulatory updates, affordability and rate base growth. Cheryl? Yes, we can. Yes. Good questions, Rich. I think first on the rate case, I would say probably just where we are in the process. I'd say settlement is probably unlikely at this stage. And as Cheryl, I think, outlined, we would expect some activity by the Commission here in the next probably several weeks, and then we'll wrap that case up later in the summer. So I don't expect to settle at this point. And again, we're pleased with where we are in the process related to that case. \n On fair market value, lots going on, obviously there, and we'll continue to watch those activities. And obviously, we're involved in discussions around any potential changes that may get made. I think in terms of what impact some of those changes may have on community's interest in selling, I think it's just wait and see. I think so many of these communities need the help, and we're quite confident in our ability to help them. And I think our focus always is on coming up with the right solution for these communities, and we'll continue to do that. So we'll certainly work with whatever framework that is provided to us by regulators and legislators in this respect. Yes. And Cheryl certainly can weigh in here too. I think our view is we'll continue to be proactive here in trying to get resolution to a CERCLA designation. But we're also just confident in our ability to execute our plan here to be compliant with the rules. We've been doing it for some time in many of our jurisdictions already. So we're quite confident in our plans and don't expect this to be a huge risk for us. Cheryl, anything you want to add? Yes, Angie, it's a good question. And again, we remain very confident in our plans, both in terms of how we execute them and the regulatory process that supports the work that we're doing in the State of Pennsylvania. There's just tremendous need in the State of Pennsylvania as there is in many of the jurisdictions that we operate in. So our focus on investment is really around the need for infrastructure improvement and we'll continue to do that work. I think the Pennsylvania case is a great example of that. We spent over $1 billion or will have spent over $1 billion in that case, and it's all focused on rate base growth. It is all focused on infrastructure renewal and replacement and the necessary work to be done in the State of Pennsylvania to bring these systems up to appropriate standards so that we can consistently provide safe and reliable water service. \n So we're -- again, we remain very confident in our plan and our ability to navigate the regulatory arena. And there is, of course, some observation around the speed with which we're filing these cases, and I think it is directly tied to the pace of our spend. We've really increased the level of spend, again, driven by the need. And when you really look at the time line of this case, it's really not much different than other water peers in the state of Pennsylvania. We may be ahead just a bit by than our nearest competitor in the state, but not by much in terms of pace. And so I don't think it's that unusual. And again, it's all driven by the need for investment and the work that we're doing to improve the quality of service in the State of Pennsylvania. Yes. I think it's probably a fair assumption to say that all of this is getting a bit tied together. The landscape around the potential legislative changes in fair market value, I think, do sort of spill over into the rate case analysis a bit. And to be clear, we included in this case, acquisitions that we have approved and expected to close during this period of time. And so as the commission sorts through that, obviously, they've got to take into consideration the status of those acquisitions and their findings in the case, which we would fully expect them to do. \n I think on a go-forward basis, we wouldn't expect there to be really any change in how we consider acquisitions in future rate cases. Yes, it's a good question. Cheryl, you want to talk about any preliminary thoughts we have about potential water usage in some of these large data center moves. We can. Sure. Yes. Cheryl, do you want to take that? And Cheryl, it is stand-alone, right? There's nothing else defined. We do think it probably helps a bit that we now have the final rules out. We've been working on this particular angle for quite some time even before the final rule was published. So now that the final rule is here, that sort of eliminates one reason why legislators didn't want to take this issue up. If they were waiting to see what the final rule was, and that was sort of an excuse to not address this issue, I think that's been removed from their list of reasons not to move. So hopefully, that helps, and we'll see continued movement here."
