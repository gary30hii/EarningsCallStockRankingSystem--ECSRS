If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I\u2019d like to welcome you to IBM\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Presentation. I\u2019m here with Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll post today\u2019s prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.\nArvind Krishna: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today, and I\u2019m pleased to be speaking with the investment community again. Over the next 15 minutes, I\u2019ll talk about where we stand in the execution of our strategy as we begin 2021, and how we are running the company to align with the strategy. I\u2019ll provide a perspective on the current environment and our results. Then, in the spirit of being as transparent with you as possible, I will speak to our expectations for the next two years. Jim Kavanaugh will then cover the quarter, give more detail on the separation process for our Managed Infrastructure Services business. I\u2019ve also asked Martin Schroeter to join us to make a few comments as the recently named CEO of this business. Jim will conclude with additional color on our 2021 expectations, and then Jim and I will take your questions. I\u2019d ask you to please bear with us if we go slightly longer than usual on this call. When I was appointed CEO in April, I laid out my approach to growing the value of the company, which is straightforward. We will significantly increase our focus on our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, the two most important transformational journeys for our clients. In the nine months since then, we have taken a series of important actions to redefine our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. This is where we are focusing the bulk of our efforts, time and investments. In spite of the many challenges in 2020, we have made good progress. In 2021, we believe you will see that progress showing up in our results. With that said, we know it\u2019s not necessarily going to be a straight line. The operating environment remains difficult because of what clients are experiencing at the moment. We can see that in the quarter just passed. Our revenue was slightly behind typical seasonality, but we finished strong in free cash flow, which is important, as it\u2019s the fuel for investments.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks Arvind. I\u2019ll go through our performance and then wrap up with a perspective of how the actions we\u2019ve taken in 2020 position us to deliver on these financial objectives. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $20.4 billion of revenue. We expanded our gross profit margin. With a significant charge for structural actions that improve our go-forward position, we reported operating earnings per share of $2.07. We generated free cash flow of $10.8 billion for the year. And we have strong liquidity with a cash position of over $14 billion. The fourth quarter is our seasonally largest transactional quarter, and I\u2019ll remind you that a year ago we had a very strong software performance and our first full quarter of z15 availability. We knew that given our product cycle dynamics and the pressure from the current environment that the fourth quarter of 2020 would be our most challenging, in terms of year-to-year revenue performance. Ninety days ago, we expected revenue and operating earnings per share to be in line with historical third to fourth quarter seasonality. In 2020, our fourth quarter revenue came in slightly below our typical seasonality, while EPS was at the higher end of the historical range, before the charge for structural actions. And we had a good finish to the year in free cash flow. The challenging environment we\u2019ve seen since March continued, with a shift in clients\u2019 buying behaviors and priorities. Given the level of macroeconomic uncertainty, more clients tended to move toward shorter duration engagements, impacting our software revenue. But we did have a good IBM Z performance relative to where we are at in the product cycle. We also continue to see good demand in offerings that support our clients\u2019 digital transformations, and we\u2019re driving strong adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. Arvind mentioned we now have 2,800 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. For perspective, that\u2019s more than a thousand new enterprise clients since we acquired Red Hat. Red Hat continued its strong performance with normalized revenue growth of 17%. That\u2019s slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by subscription growth. Strong subscription bookings contributed to over 20% backlog growth, and the Red Hat backlog is over $5 billion for the first time. Global Business Services continues to drive adoption of OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks, and over the course of 2020 we accelerated the number of GBS engagements using Red Hat technology, with 260 engagements for the year. We\u2019ve discussed the economics of a platform model, with the software and services revenue multiple anywhere from 3x to 8x the platform revenue. Our full stack cloud capabilities, from infrastructure up through our cloud services, generated over $25 billion of cloud revenue in 2020, which is up 20% over the prior year. IBM is a high value business \u2013 generating ample profit and free cash flow to invest for future growth and support our dividend policy. We again expanded our operating gross profit margin, up 70 basis points in the fourth quarter and 130 basis points for the year, with expansion across software, services and systems. This operating leverage at the gross margin level enables higher investment in innovation, in skills and in ecosystem. Our fourth quarter pre-tax profit also reflects a charge of over $2 billion for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model, and reinvest the savings to accelerate growth. This charge is $260 million, or about $0.25 of EPS less than what we discussed back in October, driven by a few countries, primarily in Europe, with government restrictions on certain employment actions in the current environment. This charge did not have much impact on our fourth quarter cash flow, and we generated over $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and $10.8 billion for the year. Our free cash flow performance in 2020 was driven by working capital improvements and contribution from Red Hat, net of related interest. This was offset by increases in net capital expenditures to scale our cloud infrastructure, and workforce rebalancing payments from previous actions. We continued to have high free cash flow realization, which was well above 100% as expected. We ended the year with a cash balance of $14.3 billion, which is up over $5 billion while our debt was down $1.4 billion, with $4.5 billion of debt maturities in the fourth quarter. Now, let me turn to the segments, starting with Cloud and Cognitive Software. Revenue was down 7% in the quarter, and gross margin was up 20 basis points. This year has proven to be a challenging transactional environment, especially in the fourth quarter, which is our largest transactional base. As I said, we had particularly strong software performance a year ago, when revenue was up 10%. The fourth quarter of 2019 was the peak of our Enterprise License Agreement or ELA cycle, which renew about every three years, on average. With the uncertainty our clients are facing in the current environment, we\u2019re seeing many of them opt for shorter duration ELAs. This dynamic, in combination with the large seasonal volume of ELAs in the fourth quarter, pressured the fourth quarter\u2019s software revenue performance. At the same time, our renewal rates for subscription and support improved this quarter, in fact it was the strongest year-to-year increase in some time. This is evidence of our clients extending their commitment to our software solutions. In this environment, our hybrid cloud and AI solutions like Red Hat and Cloud Paks are resonating with clients. In Cloud and Data Platforms, revenue was up 6%. Red Hat delivered double-digit growth in both Infrastructure and App Development and emerging technologies. We continue to gain share in both product areas, instantiating the importance of our hybrid cloud platform and the Linux foundation to our clients. Earlier this month, Red Hat announced plans to acquire StackRox, a leader and innovator in container and Kubernetes-Native Security This further enhances Red Hat OpenShift, the industry\u2019s leading enterprise hybrid cloud platform. Within cloud and data platforms, we\u2019re also building out our integration offerings, bringing AI-powered automation across the portfolio through key partnerships and new innovation. During the quarter, we acquired Instana, an application performance monitoring and observability company. We also expanded our partnership with ServiceNow to develop a joint solution around Watson AIOps, an IBM solution which helps enterprises to self-detect, diagnose and respond to IT anomalies in real time. And we continue to enhance the Cloud Pak for automation, which grew at a strong double-digit rate this quarter. Our Cognitive Applications revenue was down less than 2%. We had growth in security, fueled by our modernized Cloud Pak for Security and services. This was offset by a weaker performance in solutions concentrated in industries more impacted by the current environment, like Tririga, which is focused on commercial real estate. As expected, our software performance was most impacted by Transaction Processing Platforms. Clients\u2019 prioritization of OpEx over CapEx was amplified this quarter. With our strong seasonal mix toward transactional revenue and the ELA dynamics I just described. In Cloud and Cognitive Software, we remain focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and will continue to invest in our portfolio as we head into 2021. In Global Business Services, revenue declined 5%, which was about a point sequential improvement from the third quarter. And we had gross margin expansion of 260 basis points. Our book-to-bill in the quarter was strong, contributing to backlog growth for GBS. While there remains some market uncertainty, clients are looking to accelerate their digital reinventions by leveraging business transformation services built on hybrid cloud. Our offerings are aligned to this high-value opportunity with a clear focus on reimagining workflows using AI and modernizing the underlying application infrastructures through hybrid cloud. We see this in our GBS results. First, our GBS cloud revenue grew at a double-digit rate for the quarter and the year. And is now almost $6 billion annually. Second, our Global Process Services\u2019 revenue returned to growth, as we deliver efficiency and flexibility to our clients\u2019 processes by infusing innovative technology and redesigning workflows. And third, our consulting signings grew 8%, driven by advisory work for application modernization, and enabled by our unique and experiential Garage Methodology. In Application Management, our performance reflects a continued shift from traditional on-prem services to building and managing cloud applications. Our incumbency in Application Management creates the opportunity and trust to be the partner of choice for their digital journey. This GBS incumbency plays an important role in driving adoption of Red Hat\u2019s hybrid cloud platform. As I mentioned earlier, our GBS Red Hat engagements accelerated through the year. We had 75 engagements in the fourth quarter, with clients including BMW, Humana, Samsung Electronics, Ikea and Costco. And, similar to last quarter, approximately one-third of our quarterly Cloud Pak revenue resulted from GBS engagements. To continue this momentum, we are investing in ecosystems, resources, offerings and skills. Arvind mentioned we have announced five GBS acquisitions in the last few months. Nordcloud and Taos provide cloud native development, multi-cloud migration, and platform engineering solutions that advance our clients\u2019 cloud journeys. And, 7Summits, a leading Salesforce partner, Truqua, a leading SAP partner, and Expertus, a leading digital payments solutions provider, are collectively at the center of our clients\u2019 digital transformations. Finally, the investments we have made in our delivery capabilities, such as our innovative dynamic delivery model, have resulted in improved delivery quality, which are reflected in our net promoter scores and our gross margin expansion. Turning to Systems, revenue was down 19%, driven by product cycle dynamics, while our gross margin expanded 380 basis points. We saw the product cycle dynamics play out in IBM Z, Power and Storage. Power revenue was down at a level consistent with last quarter, and Storage revenue was also down, driven by high-end storage tied to the IBM Z cycle. IBM Z revenue was down 24% as we\u2019ve wrapped on the strong growth in the fourth quarter last year, when we were up 63%. 90 days ago, I mentioned that clients in sectors like banking and financial markets made purchases early in the cycle to manage through robust market volatility, while those in select other industries focused on cash preservation, elongating z15 adoption. We\u2019ve made up ground in the quarter, and improved adoption in some of the lagging industries. IBM Z delivered growth for the year despite a second half wrap on the product cycle and within a challenging environment. This reflects the importance of this high-value, secure and scalable platform with cloud native development capabilities. Based on this performance, we expect z15 to be fairly consistent with prior cycles. And, looking back over a longer period of time, our installed base of MIPS is over 3.5 times the level of a decade ago, with 60% of our install base now in new workload areas like Linux. The Systems portfolio continues to deliver critical and lasting value to our enterprise client base, in support of our hybrid cloud strategy. Turning to GTS, while revenue was down 8%, we expanded gross margin by 70 basis points. We had strong contract renewals and added a number of new clients. As Arvind mentioned, at the beginning of October we announced the spinoff of our Managed Infrastructure Services business into a separate public company, which we\u2019re referring to as NewCo for now. We are making good progress on that work and remain on track to complete by the end of the year. As we discussed in October, this process is complex and includes working with clients to ensure a smooth transition to NewCo as the world\u2019s leading infrastructure services provider, optimizing the business model to improve its financial profile and executing upon the necessary financial, legal and regulatory milestones to enable the transaction. I\u2019ll give you some additional color on each of these three areas. First, from a client perspective, we are deeply engaged with our clients that make up the $62 billion of backlog, and they are strongly supportive. We are seeing client confidence in NewCo\u2019s long-term value proposition to manage and modernize mission-critical infrastructures. This quarter we had wins at clients such as the Dutch Ministry of Defense, Fung Group, and Bankinter. In the fourth quarter, we signed 11 new logo deals, which is more than double the prior year, and one of the highest in the last couple of years. Our renewal rates of existing contracts this quarter were also at the higher end of our historical performance. However, while we had a strong pipeline as we entered the quarter, with the announcement, as expected some negotiations were extended, resulting in some deals moving out of the quarter. Secondly, we are optimizing the NewCo business to have a leaner and more efficient operating model. We continue to take a disciplined approach to improving our margins and overall financial profile. As part of this, a considerable portion of the $2 billion charge for structural actions was for GTS. We also have taken steps to restructure existing contracts and further reduce activity in lower value offerings. These actions impacted our revenue performance this quarter, but contributed to the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points. All of this positions NewCo for an improved margin, profit, and cash generation profile. Lastly, NewCo has an unparalleled operational footprint; it has approximately 90,000 employees and operates in roughly 115 countries. And, as you know, Managed Infrastructure Services is an integrated business, not only within IBM but within GTS. We are executing on our detailed plan to achieve the milestones to create a standalone company. Today, we are working with Works Councils on employment terms, establishing NewCo's legal entities across the world, drafting the agreements which outline the on-going relationship between IBM and NewCo, and developing audited financials. We expect the Form 10 to be available in the fall, at which time we will conduct investor outreach. We\u2019ll continue to update our progress as we move through the year. This is a good place to pause, and turn it over to Martin Schroeter, NewCo's new CEO.\nMartin Schroeter: Thank you, Jim. I am delighted and honored to be briefly speaking with you today on IBM's earnings call as the CEO of NewCo, and yes, we are working on a name. When Arvind and I began talking about this role, he let me speak with all the teams who are working on it, and as I did my due diligence, it became very clear to me that I absolutely wanted to be a part of this. With the outstanding talent in NewCo, the nature of NewCo's work for the leading companies in every industry, and the freedom of action or the mandate that NewCo will have, I could not be more excited about the future of this business. Of course, as Jim noted, we have a lot of work to do prior to NewCo being a separate, publicly traded company, and as we put all of that together I will tell you more of the story about what NewCo will look like. In the meantime, we do know what we have to get right in order to realize the tremendous potential we see. First, we know that we must continue to serve our clients. These industry leaders; NewCo's clients, trust us to deliver some of their most important workloads in challenging environments and NewCo will continue to do that. It's what our clients expect and deserve. It's always been NewCo's True North and will continue to be. And over time, our clients will see our strong investments bring new capabilities into their environments to help their ongoing journey into a more digitized world. Second, we must continue to invest and develop our teams, the teams our clients see and need every day. To our clients, our people are the face of NewCo and they are the people who know how to make these complex systems work. So, we'll build the right inclusive culture around client service, innovation and talent so our clients continue to see how our teams shine brighter than any other. Third, and in support of the other elements of our business, we must establish the financial model for NewCo that ensures our long-term success. IBM has already provided, at a high-level, some of the characteristics of NewCo's financial profile when it becomes independent. And we're working on the specifics now in order to give you a complete and clear view of NewCo's profile but we know that NewCo's long-term success requires the right starting point and we will make sure NewCo is launched the right way. And, of course, we must build a strong relationship with our owners and the broader stakeholder community. To that point, I look forward to discussing the opportunities we see and how we intend to capture them in due course. As I said, I was not going to miss the opportunity to be a part of this. With a sharper focus and broad freedom of action, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive client value and translate that into a compelling investment thesis. Now I'll turn it back to Jim.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks Martin. Now, before the Q&A, I want to bring it back up to the IBM level with a summary of the actions we are taking, and the resulting expectations for 2021. These actions span our portfolio, our operating model and our capital structure. After building a foundation in hybrid cloud, and accelerating Red Hat platform adoption, we are now separating Managed Infrastructure Services to better align to our platform strategy and improve the financial profile of both businesses. At the same time, we are increasing investments: organic and inorganic, in innovation, expertise and ecosystems. We're investing in platform capabilities, including security and industry-specific clouds. We're investing in data and AI, and in technologies like quantum to create future market opportunities. As we bring these innovations to market, we're adding GBS skills and expertise. We're making changes to our go-to-market to engage our clients in a more technical and experiential way. And we're expanding our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and broaden our reach. And in the fourth quarter we executed structural actions to simplify and streamline our business. These actions will improve the EBITDA profile of NewCo, address stranded costs from the separation and generate savings that will be reinvested to extend our position in hybrid cloud and AI, and accelerate our growth. We have also taken actions to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity, resulting in a stronger financial position. We have focused our captive financing business on IBM's hybrid cloud and AI offerings. We've exited OEM Commercial Financing and have entered into an agreement to sell our IBM Commercial Financing receivables. As a result, our financing receivables have declined from $32 billion to $18 billion over the last two years, reducing our external debt needs. Looking at our retirement-related plans, as you know we have shifted our asset base to a lower-risk, lower-return profile. At the end of the year, our plans remain well funded. Our overall returns in 2020 were well ahead of expected returns and the funded status of our worldwide qualified plans was consistent with last year. Bringing it all together, we feel good about the path we're on moving into 2021, and as Arvind said, we expect an improving financial profile throughout the year. For the full-year, we expect to grow revenue at current spot rates. In the first half, we expect our results to continue to be impacted by the shift to shorter duration software transactions as clients deal with uncertainty, and by our IBM Z product cycle dynamics. At the same time, we expect GBS to return to pre-pandemic revenue growth rates by mid-year. As I mentioned, we weren't able to execute the structural actions in all countries in the fourth quarter. We anticipate the restrictions will be lifted over the next several months and are planning to execute the remaining structural actions in the first half of 2021, which will result in $260 million of pre-tax charges. Looking at our cash flows, we expect $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2021. This reflects a year-to-year cash tax headwind of about $1 billion. But to be clear, this adjusted free cash flow does not include the cash impact of the structural actions or the transaction costs associated with the spin-off of our Managed Infrastructure Services business. For perspective, at this point we expect to pay about $4 billion for these items over the next 18 months, with about $3 billion in 2021. As we look to 2022, we expect to build on this, with adjusted free cash flow in the range of $12 billion to $13 billion. I also want to comment on our balance sheet as we enter 2021. We're in a strong liquidity position with over $14 billion of cash on hand. Our plan is to continue to de-leverage and we expect debt reduction throughout the year aligned with our scheduled maturities, so we'll have further progress in reducing debt since our peak debt balance when we financed the Red Hat acquisition in mid-2019. This, together with the actions to focus our financing business, give us confidence in operating at a single A credit rating, while we continue to de-lever. In sum, we expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company in 2021, with an improving financial profile. So, with that, let's go to Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Patricia.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. Before we begin the Q&A with Arvind and Jim, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we've included supplemental information for the quarter and the year at the end of the presentation. And finally, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference.  Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Arvind, I was hoping you might be able to double-click a bit on your comments on this \u2013 on the software turnaround, realizing you had a tough compare and transaction processing, you still had Cognitive Apps line. What specifically is being done to turn that business around to grow as we get into 2022? And what are the assets that will drive the growth there? And if I could, Jim, could you just bridge the $12 billion to $13 billion in free cash flow in 2022 versus the $10.8 billion? It seems if you hit the mid-single-digit growth rate there, that's an incremental, maybe $3 billion in revenues versus the $1 billion to $2 billion in incremental cash flow, which seems like very high cash flow margin. So if you could clarify that bridge? Thank you so much.\nArvind Krishna: Hi, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. Look, we expect to see improving software performance through the year, both in 2021 and headed into 2022. As Jim said in the prepared remarks, a lot of the shortfall in software came from the TPP segment. And in that segment, as you know, we tend to have very large deals that tend to come in the fourth quarter. So it was somewhat unique in 2020, and that is not something we expect to see at the same scale going forward. So the headwinds in some sense were reduced because of the reduction in that aspect. Then on the positive side, we expect to see continued Red Hat growth. We expect to see continued growth from our Cloud Paks. We expect to see continued growth as the salesforce changes we have made drive a much greater focus across IBM on this part of the portfolio, both in cloud and data platform and on the AI applications. We also expect to see, as Jim mentioned, that as the security and the IoT assets within the applications become larger and larger with the growth there, they will more than compensate for some of the other pieces that may not be so big, because just the law of compounding is going to get us there. And lastly, remember, other than all the organic actions, we are also doing inorganic actions. You saw us announced both Instana and StackRox in the last couple of months. And these and other future acquisitions would also drive growth because they help the entire portfolio, not just acquired pieces. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Very important as many of our investors have been asking us about the free cash flow generation profile of this company, why? It's because it's going to be the engine to fuel the investments for that growth that we committed here in 2021. But let me take a step back because I think it's important to understand coming off of a strong finish on free cash flow in 2020, delivering $10.8 billion, a 143% free cash flow realization. First, how does that bridge go to 2021 at $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow? And then I think you'll see how we then continue to accelerate that to $12 billion to $13 billion overall. So as we said in the prepared remarks, first, revenue growth, which is going to be essential here. Second, and I think you've seen this over the last couple of years, we have driven the productivity and operating leverage out of this business with our gross margin expansions, I think, now for about eight to 10 quarters in a row. So not only are we going to now turn around to revenue growth, we're going to get operating leverage, and that's going to deliver a significant amount of operating profit, a contribution to free cash flow, coupled with Red Hat being accretive net of interest expense already as we achieved our accretion in the third quarter. Now what's happening from 2020 to 2021? We're going to get substantial operating profit, but we've got a big cash tax headwind in 2021. So while you see a nice growth from $10.8 billion to $11 billion to $12 billion, we're already overcompensating for $1 billion roughly of cash tax headwind. Now, when you get to 2022, we're going to get that same level of operating profit contribution that has good leverage, but we have a much more de minimis cash tax headwind in 2022, which makes us very confident in our ability to give guidance at those levels for the next two years.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question, and nice to hear your voice, Martin. I guess, the question really is on the GTS side and the spin of NewCo. The revenue trajectory on GTS, the drop was sort of notable, I think, it went down to 8% decline versus the 4%, 5% trend line for the last few quarters. I\u2019d love to understand from Arvind or Martin, what are you hearing from your customers? I mean, do you see this as a reflection that they're perhaps pausing their decision until the spin is done or perhaps in picking up calls from your competition as this is going on? I'd just love to understand what's driving that dynamic there? And then, Jim, if you could remind me, when does the Form 10 get publicly disseminated, that'd be great?\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Hi, Amit. So in terms of the client feedback, we have talked about that we're going to do a lot of high-touch treatment of all these clients. These are really important clients for us. As both Jim and Martin said, they are our most important clients in very important industries for the overall economy. As we have talked to all of the clients, we have by and large gotten very positive feedback. Over 98% of them are quite satisfied with our description of what'll happen, both in terms of their contracts, the service they'll get from us and the assured guarantee of access to technical resources, both from the new company and from IBM over time. As that plays through, we see that. As Jim mentioned, and he touched on it very briefly. We do measure how our clients think about, so we call it Net Promoter Score measurement, and we are seeing that those have gone up, not down. So we feel comfortable that the clients will go through it. Now, all that said, maybe a few clients are going to pause on certain project elements given their own business. And so in that \u2013 in the GTS business, bonds are allowed to dial volumes up a little bit or down a little bit based on their own performance that is built into these contracts. So given let\u2019s say what's happening in the overall economy, you see some of that play through in both directions. And that is the large cause of that. The other side of it, which is the new logos, gives us confidence that the performance should be at an improving trajectory going into 2021.\nAmit Daryanani: So with that, let me give it to Jim, both to sort of add a little bit more color on the financials there and to just to repeat what he said about the Form 10?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Amit, for the question. Just to put it in perspective, GTS $6.6 billion here in the quarter, to your point down, what, 5.5% at actual, down 7.5% give or take at constant currency. It was though, up 2% quarter-to-quarter. So we saw nice seasonality and by the way, pretty consistent with what our normal 3Q to 4Q would be in GTS. Now, with that said, in addition to what Arvind had talked about, which is what we've been dealing with for the last four quarters or so given the external economic environment with lower client-based business volumes, we actually took, as I said in my prepared remarks, we took proactive actions to restructure some of our contracts to optimize our managed infrastructure services business to get ready for the spin, which is what your second question is? As we talked about on October 8, we are going to create value through focus in both IBM and in NewCo. And in NewCo, the focus is on getting the fundamentals of this business in terms of value that's margin, profit and cash. And with these actions, we will improve on the financial profile as we prepare for the spin-off, leading to again, an improved EBITDA profile approaching double-digits, post spin, a solid balance sheet targeting investment-grade rating, and a strong free cash flow yield and dividend yield that should be attractive to a financial value-based investor overall. Now, with regards to your second question on the Form 10, I think I addressed that in the prepared remarks, a lot of work being done. The complexity of this as we learn each and every day. Arvind talked about the client transition, and we're very pleased with where that's going with our new logo signings and very strong renewal rates. But if you think about the legal regulatory financial, the carve-out work right now, I think, we're well on track to achieve what we set on October 8, which is the end of the year and you should see the Form 10 sometime in the fall period.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Arvind. Let's go to the next question, please Ivey.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. If I just kind of stand back from the results this quarter, typically your revenues are up $3.4 billion from Q3 to Q4. That's the average of your last three years and there's very little movement off of that average. This year was $2.8 billion. So at least in my eyes, it looks significantly worse. And I understand there were some issues around transaction processing, I understand year-over-year comps, but this is a sequential change, which seems to be notably below trend and I hear your assurances around the current spending environment. I guess the question is, and the elephant in the room is how do you know that there isn't something more sinister afoot here that there is an accelerated migration to the cloud that you are not, IBM is not participating in? Or your \u2013 particularly some of your software offerings in cloud and cognitive are not as competitive as you might think and that's ultimately what's being reflected here. And I guess to that end as well, maybe Arvind, you can directly address why the confidence in mid single digit growth in 2022? It sounds like at constant currency, IBM is going to be flattish or maybe slightly down in 2021. So what drives the 500 basis point improvement, which on a huge company like IBM is really, really notable? How much of that do you expect to be in organic? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay, Toni, thank you very much. Arvind, I'll address the frontend piece and then you could talk about the second part of Toni's question overall, Toni, you are correct with regards to the last two to three years when you look at the sequential normal seasonality of our business topline, it's in the neighborhood of $3.3 billion, $3.4 billion. But I think you know quite well and many of our investors know quite well that sequential trajectory has been distorted by a couple of things. One, the Red Hat deferred revenue and acquisition, and two a major mainframe product cycle as you know, which is why 90 days ago I think when you asked the question to me, I answered it on a five-year CGR and I was very specific and that that average is about $3 billion. Now with that said, we delivered to your point $2.8 billion. And I think we've been open and transparent that we fell short against that expectation and we fell short specifically in software. If you look at the balance of our portfolio, which is the remaining 65% of the revenue profile of the business, we were pretty much well within and some slightly above given our strong mainframe finish to the year end. And that software shortfall, as we talked about, was a combination of the confluence of the wrap on the peak ELAs from last year. You, I think, all understand our ELA cycle, which has tremendous value to our clients and tremendous value to our financial equation. On average, those are about three year cycles. We had the peak cycle in 4Q 2019. We grew software revenue 10% off of that. And underpinning that to transactional volume in that software was up close to 30% overall. So we were in a trough year. We knew fourth quarter was going to be the most challenging quarter all year long and we've been talking about that. Now, it's really the confluence of one that peak cycle wrap which we knew about because our volumes came in pretty much what we expected. But what you're seeing to the second part of your question is yes. Is there shifts that are moving to the cloud? Yes. And by the way, I think, we're capitalizing on that. We've got $25 billion cloud-based business, that's growing 20%, and we've got continued acceleration in our hybrid cloud platform with very good performance in Red Hat, which we could talk about later. But the confluence of what happened to software is really given the uncertainty in the environment, clients are reluctant to commit long-term duration of deals. And that really hurt our, what you would call an AUR or a deal value size. Now, there's some positives to that, which I'm sure Arvind will get into. Number one, we've got shorter term durations now. So we have a much higher ELA pool in 2021. Number two, we had a very strong in fact record renewal rates, which led to a record deferred income balance, $17.1 billion overall and even stripping out Red Hat, we had the strongest quarter-to-quarter deferred income and renewal rate in our core software organic business that we've seen in 10 years. I think that's a great instantiation of our clients committing to the value of our software portfolio overall. So with that, let me turn it over to Arvind. You can dress the second piece.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. And Toni, I'll address some of the software pieces, but you asked the question about the mid single digit growth in 2022. So Toni, let me try and just deconstruct it a little bit. Red Hat continues to have very strong performance, mid to maybe high teens growth and as it gets bigger and bigger that's a bigger contributor to the total. Second GBS is going to return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-year and we actually expect it to accelerate from there, so into 2022 we'll see better growth from there. In systems, as you know, we are not going to see the product cycle dynamics as headwinds but as tailwinds going into 2022, albeit the absolute numbers are not as you see that big, our ecosystem investments that we're making. They benefit both GBS and software. And by ecosystem, I mean, both small and big partners that we work with were pulling both services and software. So when we see, for example, Salesforce or Adobe or ServiceNow, or Workday, they all tend to pull a lot of our services work. We also partner by the way with the other hyperscaling clouds, both Microsoft and Amazon, and that tends to pull a lot of GBS work. On the other side, we are also partnering with a lot of smaller software vendors and they tend to pull a lot of our software along with it. So that is there. Now you asked about the inorganic and organic. I'll call it the business as usual in organic is included in my mid single digit assessment. So by business as usual, it's just what we do. You've seen us do this for the last three quarters now, the deals like that would be included and that, for example, we did Instana and StackRox and software. Now, we did five others in services. They're not very large, but they do tend to pull the overall business. That is what gives me confidence that as we get through all of this, we got a one, two, three growth vectors, and one kind of flat vector going into 2022. And that is what gives us confidence about the overall growth going there.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Toni. Can we please take the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Can you just clarify whether you expect revenue growth at constant currency this year? And then you provided pretty specific commentary around the revenue trajectory and revenue growth on a reported basis for 2021 as well as normalized free cash flow, but you didn't speak to EPS. So is there a reason that there is less visibility into earnings this year? And can you talk just broadly about what some of the headwinds and tailwinds would be on the EPS line this year?\nArvind Krishna: Yes. So Katy, while I start on why we gave the guidance on revenue and on free cash flow and then I think Jim will get into the details on your other parts of the question. Look I've been sort of clear. I want to measure the company on revenue growth. Revenue growth is the most important metric that I'm focused on. And so, we talked about the revenue growth both for this year and for next year, which is unusual for us. The second part in order to get revenue growth, we need to be able to do investments. Investments are driven by free cash flow. And on free cash flow, it's a very clean number. So you can see what that is as we have talked about that with complete transparency both on what it is going to be and why it will grow also from 2021 to 2022. That's also what we're going to measure our people on internally and that will let then our investors know what we're measuring on. So that's why those are the two numbers that we are focused on driving, that's the numbers we're focused then on giving you, so you can hold us accountable to those. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. And Katy, let's talk a little bit about the revenue profile. I think Arvind just answered the two metrics. And by the way, I could tell you we flipped the whole operational management system. Arvind spent a lot of time about the operating model changes, the actions he has taken on how we drive signposts, milestones to deliver on those two fundamental objectives, which by the way, after the third quarter Arvind and I did an extensive outreach to many of our investors and we got unanimous feedback on what those two measures should be, which is sustainability of revenue and operating free cash flow to fuel the investment overall. But let's talk about revenue. So, we talked about growth at current spot rates. You see in the supplemental charts; you see where the U.S. dollar has weakened. Right now, at current spot rates, we expect a full year, somewhere around two points of a tailwind overall. Pretty unique position on where we've been for the last 10 years. But underneath that we did say that we expect the fundamentals of the business trajectory across our segments to improve first half to second half. And that is going to be important because to an earlier question, that acceleration has to position us for an exit velocity to get into 2022, around having a credible path for mid-single digit growth, which is what our objective is. I would tell you overall, we expect IBM RemainCo to grow both at actual rates and at constant currency. So that trajectory overall should give you a perspective right off the bat about where we should end go forward. NewCo, given where we ended in our backlog, we see improving trends, but not getting back to growth, because again, as I said earlier, we are focused on the fundamentals of that business, margin, profit, cash, and the strong EBITDA profile to set it up with an investment grade balance sheet to absorb and deliver a free cashflow yield and dividend yield overall. Underneath that you can imagine our two growth engines, Arvind talked about, software and GBS. And by the way, both of them we see growth accelerating throughout the year, software being driven by strong Red Hat. Red Hat, as we talked about, we exited over $5 billion of backlog. $2.8 billion of deferred revenue we already replenished more than what we acquired pre acquisition. And by the way, that backlog of $5 billion has grown mid-20s. So, the acceleration coming off the trough and third quarter up 16%, we just posted plus 17% that should continue to accelerate as we move through. And then GBS, we exited, our backlog is up. Our signings of small deals were up nicely and accelerated from 3Q to 4Q, we got acquisitions we're going to continue to scale, our book-to-bill exiting, fourth quarter was 1.3, the strongest it's been in a long period of time. And we've got a nice backlog revenue run out in 2021 that shows that acceleration, which gives us confidence that we can get back to pre-pandemic rope as early as the mid-year.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Katy. Ivey could you please take the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Yes, thank you. I want to build on those last comments around GBS and just dig a little bit more. It looks like apps management was still the major drag, despite a little bit of an easier compare versus the third quarter. Just wondering if you could unpack what's going on underneath there? And going forward, just how would you think about the potential of some pull through from Red Hat related work, is it like a re-platform and modernize some legacy on-prem apps? And just bigger picture the path back to growth for apps management and what that looks like from here.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Thanks Matt. I'll take this one. To your question application management services overall is an integral part of our overall hybrid cloud platform thesis. As Arvind talked about already and we shared even the prepared chart, that platform has an economic equation that has a multiplier effect. And we talked about what for every dollar a platform, we get $3 to $5 of software, we get $6 to $8 of services, both IBM and even as we scale with our ecosystem partnerships that we've accelerated over the last six months, they get into that return also. Well, let's talk about AMS. We've been speaking about this for the last few quarters. There definitely is a secular shift. We know it, a shift from on-prem enterprise application component, clients are prioritizing stability of applications in this environment, and we all know the reduced and discretionary spend components. But there's a flip side to that shift that's happening overall. And that's exactly where you went, which clients are accelerating their transformation and journey to the cloud. And we participate in there, you look at GBS\u2019 cloud business. We exited the year with almost a $6 billion book of business accelerating throughout the year. We finished the year up double digits overall up 11%. And AMS underneath that is up almost 10%. So, a very big component of that is it's essential from a cloud transformation services as part of that hybrid cloud platform. Underneath that what's driving it is application modernization work. That's where we participate in the full spectrum from advice, to build, to move and to manage. The front end of that advice and build is predominantly a consulting-based play. Consulting is up nicely and our backlog 17%. But as that journey continues, we'll start seeing AMS come back. And just a few data points for you. Number one, with that secular shift to the cloud, we are capitalizing, as I said, AMS up 8% in our total cloud book of business, we return AMS back in total to signings growth in the quarter. Our backlog improved five points quarter-to-quarter. And to the heart of your question, 80% of our Red Hat and Cloud Pak placements, are AMS incumbency enterprise clients. So, it has tremendous value in leveraging that overall, which is why we think is essential to have a differentiated value proposition for our hybrid cloud platform.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Matt. Can we please take the next question?\nOperator: Next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thanks. Thanks for extending the call for us here. I think Katy asked about EPS. I'm not sure if I heard in your answer, any call-outs on EPS cadence first half versus second half beyond the $260 million in charges and enormous seasonality? I know you are not giving formal guidance, but I thought I'd ask anyway. But on the revenue side, just thinking about, I know you've said a lot again on revenue, but if you're looking at revenue growth for fiscal 2021, I know you talked about revenue growth in fiscal 2020, but of course COVID hit and the world changed. So how has your outlook this year for growth different from this time last year in terms of your conviction? I heard some of the drivers were just really here asking about conviction and visibility.\nArvind Krishna: Hi Tien-tsin. So maybe let me start about the conviction on revenue growth. So, look from what we can see compared to what we saw last year, which is why we did not provide guidance in 2020 or rather we pulled guidance back in April. We feel that the economy, while there is uncertainty, suddenly better than it was last year. So we don't expect to see anything worse compared to last year. If anything, we talked about the second half being better because we expect as we get through, that there is going to be more demand, these projects are going to go forward. And as we look underneath, because also the question that Matt had about Red Hat and modernization, you can also see that people are signing up for bigger and bigger projects around modernization because they need to move on to their businesses also. There's only so long that you can bell type and not come out. So they are better getting past their belt tightening, we think, somewhere in the next six months. So that is why we have a lot more conviction. And that is why you heard Jim talk about the color from first half to second half, and going forward into 2020 of an increasing trajectory and he talked about that there is going to be growth for the remaining company, at both spot rates and at constant currency. So that is why we have conviction. When we look at our underlying backlogs, when we look at our pipelines and we look at the demand profiles across those parts of the business, hence the conviction in the revenue growth. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, I would just add to that Tien-tsin. Thank you for the question. Again, as Aravind talked, this is a mindset change on how we want to operate the company. We've defined the strategy all in focused, aligned our portfolio, aligned our operating model. Now it's about growth and it's about driving that operating free cash flow, which is going to fuel that investment. So around that, we talked about that trajectory overall. First of all, I should have mentioned \u2013 I mean as you can see in the supplemental chart, although we said revenue growth at current spot rates, you see that that's predominantly a first half discussion. It's about three to four points of tailwind in the first half and that dissipates quickly in the second half overall, which is why the fundamentals of the underlying business by segment will have to improve. And we expected them to improve as we move through the year. The other thing I will tell you underpinning, it's a fair question. As I stated, I think we've built the credibility over the last few years that we know how to drive operating leverage within this business. So you can expect, we grew our gross margins this year, I think about 130 basis points, 70 basis points in the fourth quarter, you can expect that we're going to continue to drive operating leverage in this business, and we'll have margin expansion in 2021. And second, the other variable that you always ask me and we talk about, and we try to be very transparent underneath it is our tax rate. And while we operate in 100 plus countries around the world, the geographic product mix can impact that dramatically tax structures, audits, et cetera, can change it. From our perspective, we finished fourth quarter at what I think 10.4% from an operating tax rate, pretty consistent by the way of third quarter and pretty consistent last year. And just given what I said earlier, one on the booked tax rate, we're going to have a headwind on cash taxes. I would expect our tax rates to go up a few points from that 10.4%. So it gives you a little bit more color underneath the revenue profile, the operating leverage and tax. And again, we're just trying to change your mindset here.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. Tien-tsin. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman from Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. Arvind, perhaps it could be a little more specific about what you were seeing in the legacy sales and marketing structure, which precipitated the re-org and maybe identify what changes you expect to be most impactful and why? And sorry for the two-part question, but Jim, perhaps you could reflect on whether there's or how much, if any free cash tailwind you're seeing in 2020 and 2021 and 2022 from the change in the IGF receivables. Thanks.\nArvind Krishna: Hi, David. Look this is something I'm deeply, deeply passionate about. So I'm happy to talk about this. Look every model has its time and then it's time to evolve. We are evolving in reaction to client needs, and we\u2019d sort of operate it which I would call it a more homogeneous model that kind of went across all our segments, all our clients for a long time. So what are we doing? There is a set of clients who do tend to buy I'll call it a lot of IBM. Let's call them they need the integrated value of IBM. We\u2019re calling that the first segment. So in this first segment, we are also going to make extra investments and then being able to experience IBM technically, so we are using the term garages. We'd have people who go in there and work side-by-side with the client, while virtually right now. As well as being able to have a lot of focus on deployment and we'll pay the people on deployment, not on selling. So this first segment is going to have that attention with extra testing. So they should see a lot of positive. And we expect to see growth coming out of our garages and our deployment managers. Then there is a segment which is largely going to be channel ready. So there we do get, as Jim talked about operational leverage, we don't need the other people. The channel is quite capable, but rather put more money into the channel and work with them to go after that. That's the other end of the spectrum. Then there is a set of clients, let's call it between these two spectrums. They tend to buy mostly from one or two parts of IBM. So they deeply value the specialists, but they don't need the generalists who were covering them. So we are going to take that money and as I said pour it into more specialists who can then cover those clients. So there is a first segment which does have a integrated value. There is a, the top half of the second segment which is going to be much more specialists, you can think of them as being technology-led sales by and large. And then there is going to be a large part, which is ecosystem-led, where the system integrators, resellers, distributors, et cetera. We believe that this simplicity is going to drive a lot more outcome for us and for our clients. And by the way, we are also going to ensure that this is the structure that all parts of IBM have. So it's not that different parts of IBM, but how slightly different clients segmentations. It's completely consistent across all. This we believe unlocks a few points of revenue growth. So you said impactful, I expect that this will unlock a few points of revenue growth albeit let me acknowledge that it probably takes six months to flow through the system.\nJim Kavanaugh,: David, let me address your good question around the IGF business and the tailwinds overall. First to just taking a step back. Within the overall IGF, consistent with our strategy, we are focusing this part of our portfolio directly aligned to be a captive financing aligned to our hybrid cloud and AI platform strategy overall. And you've seen us take a disciplined approach around both portfolio and financial management. What am I saying, one, early in 2019 we started winding down our OEM financing business. Then in 2020, as part of prudent austerity measures as we prioritized liquidity, we actually announced and you heard that in the fourth quarter, selling our IBM commercial financing receivables as part of our risk mitigation, cash and liquidity management practices. So now let me bring this all back together, because I think these actions that we've taken have resulted in a more focused and healthier financing portfolio with a very much better overall debt level and refinancing requirements that are not going to be needed overall. So if you look at the strengthening of our balance sheet, our liquidity position exiting 2020, we talked about $14.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We talked about $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We got about $4 billion to $5 billion in 2020 around leveraging and focusing that strategy about IGF. And I would assume probably something very similar to that overall. So when you take the power of those three buckets, $14 billion of cash, which I should tell you is about 2x the operating level that we need to run this company. So the excess cash there, the strong free cash flow generation and the IGF actions of $3 billion to $5 billion let's call it. You got about $30 billion of firepower. Now that's a source of cash view. Now we all know and use of cash view. What do we know? One, I talked about the $3 billion, which will be cash out the door with regards to the structural actions and the cash taxes based on the transaction. Second, we are very committed to our secured and modestly growing dividend policy, that's about 6 billion. And then third, we continue to plan to de-lever and our normal maturities are a little bit less than 7 billion this year. You add those up, you're about $15 billion plus. So we've got firepower here that gives us the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, de-lever to get back to our targeted leverage ratios and also support that secured and modestly growing dividend.\nPatricia Murphy: So we've gone pretty long here. Why don't we just \u2013 Arvind, do you want to make just a quick comment to wrap it up?\nArvind Krishna: Yes, thanks Pat. So we got a lot today. So let me just make a couple of really quick comments to wrap this up. We are confident in our strategy with digging the actions that will accelerate this change. We expect to grow in 2021 with an improving project creep through the year. And with all of that, we will look different at the end of 2021 than we do today. I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you. Thank you everyone.\nPatricia Murphy: Ivey, I\u2019m going to turn it back to you to close out the call, please.\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you for participating in today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks Arvind. I'll go through our performance and then wrap up with a perspective of how the actions we've taken in 2020 position us to deliver on these financial objectives. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $20.4 billion of revenue. We expanded our gross profit margin. With a significant charge for structural actions that improve our go-forward position, we reported operating earnings per share of $2.07. We generated free cash flow of $10.8 billion for the year. And we have strong liquidity with a cash position of over $14 billion. The fourth quarter is our seasonally largest transactional quarter, and I'll remind you that a year ago we had a very strong software performance and our first full quarter of z15 availability. We knew that given our product cycle dynamics and the pressure from the current environment that the fourth quarter of 2020 would be our most challenging, in terms of year-to-year revenue performance. Ninety days ago, we expected revenue and operating earnings per share to be in line with historical third to fourth quarter seasonality. In 2020, our fourth quarter revenue came in slightly below our typical seasonality, while EPS was at the higher end of the historical range, before the charge for structural actions. And we had a good finish to the year in free cash flow. The challenging environment we've seen since March continued, with a shift in clients' buying behaviors and priorities. Given the level of macroeconomic uncertainty, more clients tended to move toward shorter duration engagements, impacting our software revenue. But we did have a good IBM Z performance relative to where we are at in the product cycle. We also continue to see good demand in offerings that support our clients' digital transformations, and we're driving strong adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. Arvind mentioned we now have 2,800 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. For perspective, that's more than a thousand new enterprise clients since we acquired Red Hat. Red Hat continued its strong performance with normalized revenue growth of 17%. That's slightly higher than the third quarter rate, driven by subscription growth. Strong subscription bookings contributed to over 20% backlog growth, and the Red Hat backlog is over $5 billion for the first time. Global Business Services continues to drive adoption of OpenShift and IBM Cloud Paks, and over the course of 2020 we accelerated the number of GBS engagements using Red Hat technology, with 260 engagements for the year. We've discussed the economics of a platform model, with the software and services revenue multiple anywhere from 3x to 8x the platform revenue. Our full stack cloud capabilities, from infrastructure up through our cloud services, generated over $25 billion of cloud revenue in 2020, which is up 20% over the prior year. IBM is a high value business \u2013 generating ample profit and free cash flow to invest for future growth and support our dividend policy. We again expanded our operating gross profit margin, up 70 basis points in the fourth quarter and 130 basis points for the year, with expansion across software, services and systems. This operating leverage at the gross margin level enables higher investment in innovation, in skills and in ecosystem. Our fourth quarter pre-tax profit also reflects a charge of over $2 billion for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model, and reinvest the savings to accelerate growth. This charge is $260 million, or about $0.25 of EPS less than what we discussed back in October, driven by a few countries, primarily in Europe, with government restrictions on certain employment actions in the current environment. This charge did not have much impact on our fourth quarter cash flow, and we generated over $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and $10.8 billion for the year. Our free cash flow performance in 2020 was driven by working capital improvements and contribution from Red Hat, net of related interest. This was offset by increases in net capital expenditures to scale our cloud infrastructure, and workforce rebalancing payments from previous actions. We continued to have high free cash flow realization, which was well above 100% as expected. We ended the year with a cash balance of $14.3 billion, which is up over $5 billion while our debt was down $1.4 billion, with $4.5 billion of debt maturities in the fourth quarter. Now, let me turn to the segments, starting with Cloud and Cognitive Software. Revenue was down 7% in the quarter, and gross margin was up 20 basis points. This year has proven to be a challenging transactional environment, especially in the fourth quarter, which is our largest transactional base. As I said, we had particularly strong software performance a year ago, when revenue was up 10%. The fourth quarter of 2019 was the peak of our Enterprise License Agreement or ELA cycle, which renew about every three years, on average. With the uncertainty our clients are facing in the current environment, we're seeing many of them opt for shorter duration ELAs. This dynamic, in combination with the large seasonal volume of ELAs in the fourth quarter, pressured the fourth quarter's software revenue performance. At the same time, our renewal rates for subscription and support improved this quarter, in fact it was the strongest year-to-year increase in some time. This is evidence of our clients extending their commitment to our software solutions. In this environment, our hybrid cloud and AI solutions like Red Hat and Cloud Paks are resonating with clients. In Cloud and Data Platforms, revenue was up 6%. Red Hat delivered double-digit growth in both Infrastructure and App Development and emerging technologies. We continue to gain share in both product areas, instantiating the importance of our hybrid cloud platform and the Linux foundation to our clients. Earlier this month, Red Hat announced plans to acquire StackRox, a leader and innovator in container and Kubernetes-Native Security This further enhances Red Hat OpenShift, the industry's leading enterprise hybrid cloud platform. Within cloud and data platforms, we're also building out our integration offerings, bringing AI-powered automation across the portfolio through key partnerships and new innovation. During the quarter, we acquired Instana, an application performance monitoring and observability company. We also expanded our partnership with ServiceNow to develop a joint solution around Watson AIOps, an IBM solution which helps enterprises to self-detect, diagnose and respond to IT anomalies in real time. And we continue to enhance the Cloud Pak for automation, which grew at a strong double-digit rate this quarter. Our Cognitive Applications revenue was down less than 2%. We had growth in security, fueled by our modernized Cloud Pak for Security and services. This was offset by a weaker performance in solutions concentrated in industries more impacted by the current environment, like Tririga, which is focused on commercial real estate. As expected, our software performance was most impacted by Transaction Processing Platforms. Clients' prioritization of OpEx over CapEx was amplified this quarter. With our strong seasonal mix toward transactional revenue and the ELA dynamics I just described. In Cloud and Cognitive Software, we remain focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and will continue to invest in our portfolio as we head into 2021. In Global Business Services, revenue declined 5%, which was about a point sequential improvement from the third quarter. And we had gross margin expansion of 260 basis points. Our book-to-bill in the quarter was strong, contributing to backlog growth for GBS. While there remains some market uncertainty, clients are looking to accelerate their digital reinventions by leveraging business transformation services built on hybrid cloud. Our offerings are aligned to this high-value opportunity with a clear focus on reimagining workflows using AI and modernizing the underlying application infrastructures through hybrid cloud. We see this in our GBS results. First, our GBS cloud revenue grew at a double-digit rate for the quarter and the year. And is now almost $6 billion annually. Second, our Global Process Services' revenue returned to growth, as we deliver efficiency and flexibility to our clients' processes by infusing innovative technology and redesigning workflows. And third, our consulting signings grew 8%, driven by advisory work for application modernization, and enabled by our unique and experiential Garage Methodology. In Application Management, our performance reflects a continued shift from traditional on-prem services to building and managing cloud applications. Our incumbency in Application Management creates the opportunity and trust to be the partner of choice for their digital journey. This GBS incumbency plays an important role in driving adoption of Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform. As I mentioned earlier, our GBS Red Hat engagements accelerated through the year. We had 75 engagements in the fourth quarter, with clients including BMW, Humana, Samsung Electronics, Ikea and Costco. And, similar to last quarter, approximately one-third of our quarterly Cloud Pak revenue resulted from GBS engagements. To continue this momentum, we are investing in ecosystems, resources, offerings and skills. Arvind mentioned we have announced five GBS acquisitions in the last few months. Nordcloud and Taos provide cloud native development, multi-cloud migration, and platform engineering solutions that advance our clients' cloud journeys. And, 7Summits, a leading Salesforce partner, Truqua, a leading SAP partner, and Expertus, a leading digital payments solutions provider, are collectively at the center of our clients' digital transformations. Finally, the investments we have made in our delivery capabilities, such as our innovative dynamic delivery model, have resulted in improved delivery quality, which are reflected in our net promoter scores and our gross margin expansion. Turning to Systems, revenue was down 19%, driven by product cycle dynamics, while our gross margin expanded 380 basis points. We saw the product cycle dynamics play out in IBM Z, Power and Storage. Power revenue was down at a level consistent with last quarter, and Storage revenue was also down, driven by high-end storage tied to the IBM Z cycle. IBM Z revenue was down 24% as we've wrapped on the strong growth in the fourth quarter last year, when we were up 63%. 90 days ago, I mentioned that clients in sectors like banking and financial markets made purchases early in the cycle to manage through robust market volatility, while those in select other industries focused on cash preservation, elongating z15 adoption. We've made up ground in the quarter, and improved adoption in some of the lagging industries. IBM Z delivered growth for the year despite a second half wrap on the product cycle and within a challenging environment. This reflects the importance of this high-value, secure and scalable platform with cloud native development capabilities. Based on this performance, we expect z15 to be fairly consistent with prior cycles. And, looking back over a longer period of time, our installed base of MIPS is over 3.5 times the level of a decade ago, with 60% of our install base now in new workload areas like Linux. The Systems portfolio continues to deliver critical and lasting value to our enterprise client base, in support of our hybrid cloud strategy. Turning to GTS, while revenue was down 8%, we expanded gross margin by 70 basis points. We had strong contract renewals and added a number of new clients. As Arvind mentioned, at the beginning of October we announced the spinoff of our Managed Infrastructure Services business into a separate public company, which we're referring to as NewCo for now. We are making good progress on that work and remain on track to complete by the end of the year. As we discussed in October, this process is complex and includes working with clients to ensure a smooth transition to NewCo as the world's leading infrastructure services provider, optimizing the business model to improve its financial profile and executing upon the necessary financial, legal and regulatory milestones to enable the transaction. I'll give you some additional color on each of these three areas. First, from a client perspective, we are deeply engaged with our clients that make up the $62 billion of backlog, and they are strongly supportive. We are seeing client confidence in NewCo's long-term value proposition to manage and modernize mission-critical infrastructures. This quarter we had wins at clients such as the Dutch Ministry of Defense, Fung Group, and Bankinter. In the fourth quarter, we signed 11 new logo deals, which is more than double the prior year, and one of the highest in the last couple of years. Our renewal rates of existing contracts this quarter were also at the higher end of our historical performance. However, while we had a strong pipeline as we entered the quarter, with the announcement, as expected some negotiations were extended, resulting in some deals moving out of the quarter. Secondly, we are optimizing the NewCo business to have a leaner and more efficient operating model. We continue to take a disciplined approach to improving our margins and overall financial profile. As part of this, a considerable portion of the $2 billion charge for structural actions was for GTS. We also have taken steps to restructure existing contracts and further reduce activity in lower value offerings. These actions impacted our revenue performance this quarter, but contributed to the gross margin expansion of 70 basis points. All of this positions NewCo for an improved margin, profit, and cash generation profile. Lastly, NewCo has an unparalleled operational footprint; it has approximately 90,000 employees and operates in roughly 115 countries. And, as you know, Managed Infrastructure Services is an integrated business, not only within IBM but within GTS. We are executing on our detailed plan to achieve the milestones to create a standalone company. Today, we are working with Works Councils on employment terms, establishing NewCo's legal entities across the world, drafting the agreements which outline the on-going relationship between IBM and NewCo, and developing audited financials. We expect the Form 10 to be available in the fall, at which time we will conduct investor outreach. We'll continue to update our progress as we move through the year. This is a good place to pause, and turn it over to Martin Schroeter, NewCo's new CEO. Thanks Martin. Now, before the Q&A, I want to bring it back up to the IBM level with a summary of the actions we are taking, and the resulting expectations for 2021. These actions span our portfolio, our operating model and our capital structure. After building a foundation in hybrid cloud, and accelerating Red Hat platform adoption, we are now separating Managed Infrastructure Services to better align to our platform strategy and improve the financial profile of both businesses. At the same time, we are increasing investments: organic and inorganic, in innovation, expertise and ecosystems. We're investing in platform capabilities, including security and industry-specific clouds. We're investing in data and AI, and in technologies like quantum to create future market opportunities. As we bring these innovations to market, we're adding GBS skills and expertise. We're making changes to our go-to-market to engage our clients in a more technical and experiential way. And we're expanding our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and broaden our reach. And in the fourth quarter we executed structural actions to simplify and streamline our business. These actions will improve the EBITDA profile of NewCo, address stranded costs from the separation and generate savings that will be reinvested to extend our position in hybrid cloud and AI, and accelerate our growth. We have also taken actions to enhance our balance sheet and liquidity, resulting in a stronger financial position. We have focused our captive financing business on IBM's hybrid cloud and AI offerings. We've exited OEM Commercial Financing and have entered into an agreement to sell our IBM Commercial Financing receivables. As a result, our financing receivables have declined from $32 billion to $18 billion over the last two years, reducing our external debt needs. Looking at our retirement-related plans, as you know we have shifted our asset base to a lower-risk, lower-return profile. At the end of the year, our plans remain well funded. Our overall returns in 2020 were well ahead of expected returns and the funded status of our worldwide qualified plans was consistent with last year. Bringing it all together, we feel good about the path we're on moving into 2021, and as Arvind said, we expect an improving financial profile throughout the year. For the full-year, we expect to grow revenue at current spot rates. In the first half, we expect our results to continue to be impacted by the shift to shorter duration software transactions as clients deal with uncertainty, and by our IBM Z product cycle dynamics. At the same time, we expect GBS to return to pre-pandemic revenue growth rates by mid-year. As I mentioned, we weren't able to execute the structural actions in all countries in the fourth quarter. We anticipate the restrictions will be lifted over the next several months and are planning to execute the remaining structural actions in the first half of 2021, which will result in $260 million of pre-tax charges. Looking at our cash flows, we expect $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow in 2021. This reflects a year-to-year cash tax headwind of about $1 billion. But to be clear, this adjusted free cash flow does not include the cash impact of the structural actions or the transaction costs associated with the spin-off of our Managed Infrastructure Services business. For perspective, at this point we expect to pay about $4 billion for these items over the next 18 months, with about $3 billion in 2021. As we look to 2022, we expect to build on this, with adjusted free cash flow in the range of $12 billion to $13 billion. I also want to comment on our balance sheet as we enter 2021. We're in a strong liquidity position with over $14 billion of cash on hand. Our plan is to continue to de-leverage and we expect debt reduction throughout the year aligned with our scheduled maturities, so we'll have further progress in reducing debt since our peak debt balance when we financed the Red Hat acquisition in mid-2019. This, together with the actions to focus our financing business, give us confidence in operating at a single A credit rating, while we continue to de-lever. In sum, we expect to continue our progress as a leading hybrid cloud and AI company in 2021, with an improving financial profile. So, with that, let's go to Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Patricia. Okay. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Very important as many of our investors have been asking us about the free cash flow generation profile of this company, why? It's because it's going to be the engine to fuel the investments for that growth that we committed here in 2021. But let me take a step back because I think it's important to understand coming off of a strong finish on free cash flow in 2020, delivering $10.8 billion, a 143% free cash flow realization. First, how does that bridge go to 2021 at $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow? And then I think you'll see how we then continue to accelerate that to $12 billion to $13 billion overall. So as we said in the prepared remarks, first, revenue growth, which is going to be essential here. Second, and I think you've seen this over the last couple of years, we have driven the productivity and operating leverage out of this business with our gross margin expansions, I think, now for about eight to 10 quarters in a row. So not only are we going to now turn around to revenue growth, we're going to get operating leverage, and that's going to deliver a significant amount of operating profit, a contribution to free cash flow, coupled with Red Hat being accretive net of interest expense already as we achieved our accretion in the third quarter. Now what's happening from 2020 to 2021? We're going to get substantial operating profit, but we've got a big cash tax headwind in 2021. So while you see a nice growth from $10.8 billion to $11 billion to $12 billion, we're already overcompensating for $1 billion roughly of cash tax headwind. Now, when you get to 2022, we're going to get that same level of operating profit contribution that has good leverage, but we have a much more de minimis cash tax headwind in 2022, which makes us very confident in our ability to give guidance at those levels for the next two years. Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Amit, for the question. Just to put it in perspective, GTS $6.6 billion here in the quarter, to your point down, what, 5.5% at actual, down 7.5% give or take at constant currency. It was though, up 2% quarter-to-quarter. So we saw nice seasonality and by the way, pretty consistent with what our normal 3Q to 4Q would be in GTS. Now, with that said, in addition to what Arvind had talked about, which is what we've been dealing with for the last four quarters or so given the external economic environment with lower client-based business volumes, we actually took, as I said in my prepared remarks, we took proactive actions to restructure some of our contracts to optimize our managed infrastructure services business to get ready for the spin, which is what your second question is? As we talked about on October 8, we are going to create value through focus in both IBM and in NewCo. And in NewCo, the focus is on getting the fundamentals of this business in terms of value that's margin, profit and cash. And with these actions, we will improve on the financial profile as we prepare for the spin-off, leading to again, an improved EBITDA profile approaching double-digits, post spin, a solid balance sheet targeting investment-grade rating, and a strong free cash flow yield and dividend yield that should be attractive to a financial value-based investor overall. Now, with regards to your second question on the Form 10, I think I addressed that in the prepared remarks, a lot of work being done. The complexity of this as we learn each and every day. Arvind talked about the client transition, and we're very pleased with where that's going with our new logo signings and very strong renewal rates. But if you think about the legal regulatory financial, the carve-out work right now, I think, we're well on track to achieve what we set on October 8, which is the end of the year and you should see the Form 10 sometime in the fall period. Okay, Toni, thank you very much. Arvind, I'll address the frontend piece and then you could talk about the second part of Toni's question overall, Toni, you are correct with regards to the last two to three years when you look at the sequential normal seasonality of our business topline, it's in the neighborhood of $3.3 billion, $3.4 billion. But I think you know quite well and many of our investors know quite well that sequential trajectory has been distorted by a couple of things. One, the Red Hat deferred revenue and acquisition, and two a major mainframe product cycle as you know, which is why 90 days ago I think when you asked the question to me, I answered it on a five-year CGR and I was very specific and that that average is about $3 billion. Now with that said, we delivered to your point $2.8 billion. And I think we've been open and transparent that we fell short against that expectation and we fell short specifically in software. If you look at the balance of our portfolio, which is the remaining 65% of the revenue profile of the business, we were pretty much well within and some slightly above given our strong mainframe finish to the year end. And that software shortfall, as we talked about, was a combination of the confluence of the wrap on the peak ELAs from last year. You, I think, all understand our ELA cycle, which has tremendous value to our clients and tremendous value to our financial equation. On average, those are about three year cycles. We had the peak cycle in 4Q 2019. We grew software revenue 10% off of that. And underpinning that to transactional volume in that software was up close to 30% overall. So we were in a trough year. We knew fourth quarter was going to be the most challenging quarter all year long and we've been talking about that. Now, it's really the confluence of one that peak cycle wrap which we knew about because our volumes came in pretty much what we expected. But what you're seeing to the second part of your question is yes. Is there shifts that are moving to the cloud? Yes. And by the way, I think, we're capitalizing on that. We've got $25 billion cloud-based business, that's growing 20%, and we've got continued acceleration in our hybrid cloud platform with very good performance in Red Hat, which we could talk about later. But the confluence of what happened to software is really given the uncertainty in the environment, clients are reluctant to commit long-term duration of deals. And that really hurt our, what you would call an AUR or a deal value size. Now, there's some positives to that, which I'm sure Arvind will get into. Number one, we've got shorter term durations now. So we have a much higher ELA pool in 2021. Number two, we had a very strong in fact record renewal rates, which led to a record deferred income balance, $17.1 billion overall and even stripping out Red Hat, we had the strongest quarter-to-quarter deferred income and renewal rate in our core software organic business that we've seen in 10 years. I think that's a great instantiation of our clients committing to the value of our software portfolio overall. So with that, let me turn it over to Arvind. You can dress the second piece. Okay. And Katy, let's talk a little bit about the revenue profile. I think Arvind just answered the two metrics. And by the way, I could tell you we flipped the whole operational management system. Arvind spent a lot of time about the operating model changes, the actions he has taken on how we drive signposts, milestones to deliver on those two fundamental objectives, which by the way, after the third quarter Arvind and I did an extensive outreach to many of our investors and we got unanimous feedback on what those two measures should be, which is sustainability of revenue and operating free cash flow to fuel the investment overall. But let's talk about revenue. So, we talked about growth at current spot rates. You see in the supplemental charts; you see where the U.S. dollar has weakened. Right now, at current spot rates, we expect a full year, somewhere around two points of a tailwind overall. Pretty unique position on where we've been for the last 10 years. But underneath that we did say that we expect the fundamentals of the business trajectory across our segments to improve first half to second half. And that is going to be important because to an earlier question, that acceleration has to position us for an exit velocity to get into 2022, around having a credible path for mid-single digit growth, which is what our objective is. I would tell you overall, we expect IBM RemainCo to grow both at actual rates and at constant currency. So that trajectory overall should give you a perspective right off the bat about where we should end go forward. NewCo, given where we ended in our backlog, we see improving trends, but not getting back to growth, because again, as I said earlier, we are focused on the fundamentals of that business, margin, profit, cash, and the strong EBITDA profile to set it up with an investment grade balance sheet to absorb and deliver a free cashflow yield and dividend yield overall. Underneath that you can imagine our two growth engines, Arvind talked about, software and GBS. And by the way, both of them we see growth accelerating throughout the year, software being driven by strong Red Hat. Red Hat, as we talked about, we exited over $5 billion of backlog. $2.8 billion of deferred revenue we already replenished more than what we acquired pre acquisition. And by the way, that backlog of $5 billion has grown mid-20s. So, the acceleration coming off the trough and third quarter up 16%, we just posted plus 17% that should continue to accelerate as we move through. And then GBS, we exited, our backlog is up. Our signings of small deals were up nicely and accelerated from 3Q to 4Q, we got acquisitions we're going to continue to scale, our book-to-bill exiting, fourth quarter was 1.3, the strongest it's been in a long period of time. And we've got a nice backlog revenue run out in 2021 that shows that acceleration, which gives us confidence that we can get back to pre-pandemic rope as early as the mid-year. Yes. Thanks Matt. I'll take this one. To your question application management services overall is an integral part of our overall hybrid cloud platform thesis. As Arvind talked about already and we shared even the prepared chart, that platform has an economic equation that has a multiplier effect. And we talked about what for every dollar a platform, we get $3 to $5 of software, we get $6 to $8 of services, both IBM and even as we scale with our ecosystem partnerships that we've accelerated over the last six months, they get into that return also. Well, let's talk about AMS. We've been speaking about this for the last few quarters. There definitely is a secular shift. We know it, a shift from on-prem enterprise application component, clients are prioritizing stability of applications in this environment, and we all know the reduced and discretionary spend components. But there's a flip side to that shift that's happening overall. And that's exactly where you went, which clients are accelerating their transformation and journey to the cloud. And we participate in there, you look at GBS' cloud business. We exited the year with almost a $6 billion book of business accelerating throughout the year. We finished the year up double digits overall up 11%. And AMS underneath that is up almost 10%. So, a very big component of that is it's essential from a cloud transformation services as part of that hybrid cloud platform. Underneath that what's driving it is application modernization work. That's where we participate in the full spectrum from advice, to build, to move and to manage. The front end of that advice and build is predominantly a consulting-based play. Consulting is up nicely and our backlog 17%. But as that journey continues, we'll start seeing AMS come back. And just a few data points for you. Number one, with that secular shift to the cloud, we are capitalizing, as I said, AMS up 8% in our total cloud book of business, we return AMS back in total to signings growth in the quarter. Our backlog improved five points quarter-to-quarter. And to the heart of your question, 80% of our Red Hat and Cloud Pak placements, are AMS incumbency enterprise clients. So, it has tremendous value in leveraging that overall, which is why we think is essential to have a differentiated value proposition for our hybrid cloud platform. Yes, I would just add to that Tien-tsin. Thank you for the question. Again, as Aravind talked, this is a mindset change on how we want to operate the company. We've defined the strategy all in focused, aligned our portfolio, aligned our operating model. Now it's about growth and it's about driving that operating free cash flow, which is going to fuel that investment. So around that, we talked about that trajectory overall. First of all, I should have mentioned \u2013 I mean as you can see in the supplemental chart, although we said revenue growth at current spot rates, you see that that's predominantly a first half discussion. It's about three to four points of tailwind in the first half and that dissipates quickly in the second half overall, which is why the fundamentals of the underlying business by segment will have to improve. And we expected them to improve as we move through the year. The other thing I will tell you underpinning, it's a fair question. As I stated, I think we've built the credibility over the last few years that we know how to drive operating leverage within this business. So you can expect, we grew our gross margins this year, I think about 130 basis points, 70 basis points in the fourth quarter, you can expect that we're going to continue to drive operating leverage in this business, and we'll have margin expansion in 2021. And second, the other variable that you always ask me and we talk about, and we try to be very transparent underneath it is our tax rate. And while we operate in 100 plus countries around the world, the geographic product mix can impact that dramatically tax structures, audits, et cetera, can change it. From our perspective, we finished fourth quarter at what I think 10.4% from an operating tax rate, pretty consistent by the way of third quarter and pretty consistent last year. And just given what I said earlier, one on the booked tax rate, we're going to have a headwind on cash taxes. I would expect our tax rates to go up a few points from that 10.4%. So it gives you a little bit more color underneath the revenue profile, the operating leverage and tax. And again, we're just trying to change your mindset here."

            "name": "Martin Schroeter",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim. I am delighted and honored to be briefly speaking with you today on IBM's earnings call as the CEO of NewCo, and yes, we are working on a name. When Arvind and I began talking about this role, he let me speak with all the teams who are working on it, and as I did my due diligence, it became very clear to me that I absolutely wanted to be a part of this. With the outstanding talent in NewCo, the nature of NewCo's work for the leading companies in every industry, and the freedom of action or the mandate that NewCo will have, I could not be more excited about the future of this business. Of course, as Jim noted, we have a lot of work to do prior to NewCo being a separate, publicly traded company, and as we put all of that together I will tell you more of the story about what NewCo will look like. In the meantime, we do know what we have to get right in order to realize the tremendous potential we see. First, we know that we must continue to serve our clients. These industry leaders; NewCo's clients, trust us to deliver some of their most important workloads in challenging environments and NewCo will continue to do that. It's what our clients expect and deserve. It's always been NewCo's True North and will continue to be. And over time, our clients will see our strong investments bring new capabilities into their environments to help their ongoing journey into a more digitized world. Second, we must continue to invest and develop our teams, the teams our clients see and need every day. To our clients, our people are the face of NewCo and they are the people who know how to make these complex systems work. So, we'll build the right inclusive culture around client service, innovation and talent so our clients continue to see how our teams shine brighter than any other. Third, and in support of the other elements of our business, we must establish the financial model for NewCo that ensures our long-term success. IBM has already provided, at a high-level, some of the characteristics of NewCo's financial profile when it becomes independent. And we're working on the specifics now in order to give you a complete and clear view of NewCo's profile but we know that NewCo's long-term success requires the right starting point and we will make sure NewCo is launched the right way. And, of course, we must build a strong relationship with our owners and the broader stakeholder community. To that point, I look forward to discussing the opportunities we see and how we intend to capture them in due course. As I said, I was not going to miss the opportunity to be a part of this. With a sharper focus and broad freedom of action, we have a tremendous opportunity to drive client value and translate that into a compelling investment thesis. Now I'll turn it back to Jim."
        },
        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining today, and I'm pleased to be speaking with the investment community again. Over the next 15 minutes, I'll talk about where we stand in the execution of our strategy as we begin 2021, and how we are running the company to align with the strategy. I'll provide a perspective on the current environment and our results. Then, in the spirit of being as transparent with you as possible, I will speak to our expectations for the next two years. Jim Kavanaugh will then cover the quarter, give more detail on the separation process for our Managed Infrastructure Services business. I've also asked Martin Schroeter to join us to make a few comments as the recently named CEO of this business. Jim will conclude with additional color on our 2021 expectations, and then Jim and I will take your questions. I'd ask you to please bear with us if we go slightly longer than usual on this call. When I was appointed CEO in April, I laid out my approach to growing the value of the company, which is straightforward. We will significantly increase our focus on our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, the two most important transformational journeys for our clients. In the nine months since then, we have taken a series of important actions to redefine our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. This is where we are focusing the bulk of our efforts, time and investments. In spite of the many challenges in 2020, we have made good progress. In 2021, we believe you will see that progress showing up in our results. With that said, we know it's not necessarily going to be a straight line. The operating environment remains difficult because of what clients are experiencing at the moment. We can see that in the quarter just passed. Our revenue was slightly behind typical seasonality, but we finished strong in free cash flow, which is important, as it's the fuel for investments. Hi, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. Look, we expect to see improving software performance through the year, both in 2021 and headed into 2022. As Jim said in the prepared remarks, a lot of the shortfall in software came from the TPP segment. And in that segment, as you know, we tend to have very large deals that tend to come in the fourth quarter. So it was somewhat unique in 2020, and that is not something we expect to see at the same scale going forward. So the headwinds in some sense were reduced because of the reduction in that aspect. Then on the positive side, we expect to see continued Red Hat growth. We expect to see continued growth from our Cloud Paks. We expect to see continued growth as the salesforce changes we have made drive a much greater focus across IBM on this part of the portfolio, both in cloud and data platform and on the AI applications. We also expect to see, as Jim mentioned, that as the security and the IoT assets within the applications become larger and larger with the growth there, they will more than compensate for some of the other pieces that may not be so big, because just the law of compounding is going to get us there. And lastly, remember, other than all the organic actions, we are also doing inorganic actions. You saw us announced both Instana and StackRox in the last couple of months. And these and other future acquisitions would also drive growth because they help the entire portfolio, not just acquired pieces. Jim? Okay. Hi, Amit. So in terms of the client feedback, we have talked about that we're going to do a lot of high-touch treatment of all these clients. These are really important clients for us. As both Jim and Martin said, they are our most important clients in very important industries for the overall economy. As we have talked to all of the clients, we have by and large gotten very positive feedback. Over 98% of them are quite satisfied with our description of what'll happen, both in terms of their contracts, the service they'll get from us and the assured guarantee of access to technical resources, both from the new company and from IBM over time. As that plays through, we see that. As Jim mentioned, and he touched on it very briefly. We do measure how our clients think about, so we call it Net Promoter Score measurement, and we are seeing that those have gone up, not down. So we feel comfortable that the clients will go through it. Now, all that said, maybe a few clients are going to pause on certain project elements given their own business. And so in that \u2013 in the GTS business, bonds are allowed to dial volumes up a little bit or down a little bit based on their own performance that is built into these contracts. So given let's say what's happening in the overall economy, you see some of that play through in both directions. And that is the large cause of that. The other side of it, which is the new logos, gives us confidence that the performance should be at an improving trajectory going into 2021. Thanks, Jim. And Toni, I'll address some of the software pieces, but you asked the question about the mid single digit growth in 2022. So Toni, let me try and just deconstruct it a little bit. Red Hat continues to have very strong performance, mid to maybe high teens growth and as it gets bigger and bigger that's a bigger contributor to the total. Second GBS is going to return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-year and we actually expect it to accelerate from there, so into 2022 we'll see better growth from there. In systems, as you know, we are not going to see the product cycle dynamics as headwinds but as tailwinds going into 2022, albeit the absolute numbers are not as you see that big, our ecosystem investments that we're making. They benefit both GBS and software. And by ecosystem, I mean, both small and big partners that we work with were pulling both services and software. So when we see, for example, Salesforce or Adobe or ServiceNow, or Workday, they all tend to pull a lot of our services work. We also partner by the way with the other hyperscaling clouds, both Microsoft and Amazon, and that tends to pull a lot of GBS work. On the other side, we are also partnering with a lot of smaller software vendors and they tend to pull a lot of our software along with it. So that is there. Now you asked about the inorganic and organic. I'll call it the business as usual in organic is included in my mid single digit assessment. So by business as usual, it's just what we do. You've seen us do this for the last three quarters now, the deals like that would be included and that, for example, we did Instana and StackRox and software. Now, we did five others in services. They're not very large, but they do tend to pull the overall business. That is what gives me confidence that as we get through all of this, we got a one, two, three growth vectors, and one kind of flat vector going into 2022. And that is what gives us confidence about the overall growth going there. Yes. So Katy, while I start on why we gave the guidance on revenue and on free cash flow and then I think Jim will get into the details on your other parts of the question. Look I've been sort of clear. I want to measure the company on revenue growth. Revenue growth is the most important metric that I'm focused on. And so, we talked about the revenue growth both for this year and for next year, which is unusual for us. The second part in order to get revenue growth, we need to be able to do investments. Investments are driven by free cash flow. And on free cash flow, it's a very clean number. So you can see what that is as we have talked about that with complete transparency both on what it is going to be and why it will grow also from 2021 to 2022. That's also what we're going to measure our people on internally and that will let then our investors know what we're measuring on. So that's why those are the two numbers that we are focused on driving, that's the numbers we're focused then on giving you, so you can hold us accountable to those. Jim? Hi Tien-tsin. So maybe let me start about the conviction on revenue growth. So, look from what we can see compared to what we saw last year, which is why we did not provide guidance in 2020 or rather we pulled guidance back in April. We feel that the economy, while there is uncertainty, suddenly better than it was last year. So we don't expect to see anything worse compared to last year. If anything, we talked about the second half being better because we expect as we get through, that there is going to be more demand, these projects are going to go forward. And as we look underneath, because also the question that Matt had about Red Hat and modernization, you can also see that people are signing up for bigger and bigger projects around modernization because they need to move on to their businesses also. There's only so long that you can bell type and not come out. So they are better getting past their belt tightening, we think, somewhere in the next six months. So that is why we have a lot more conviction. And that is why you heard Jim talk about the color from first half to second half, and going forward into 2020 of an increasing trajectory and he talked about that there is going to be growth for the remaining company, at both spot rates and at constant currency. So that is why we have conviction. When we look at our underlying backlogs, when we look at our pipelines and we look at the demand profiles across those parts of the business, hence the conviction in the revenue growth. Jim? Hi, David. Look this is something I'm deeply, deeply passionate about. So I'm happy to talk about this. Look every model has its time and then it's time to evolve. We are evolving in reaction to client needs, and we'd sort of operate it which I would call it a more homogeneous model that kind of went across all our segments, all our clients for a long time. So what are we doing? There is a set of clients who do tend to buy I'll call it a lot of IBM. Let's call them they need the integrated value of IBM. We're calling that the first segment. So in this first segment, we are also going to make extra investments and then being able to experience IBM technically, so we are using the term garages. We'd have people who go in there and work side-by-side with the client, while virtually right now. As well as being able to have a lot of focus on deployment and we'll pay the people on deployment, not on selling. So this first segment is going to have that attention with extra testing. So they should see a lot of positive. And we expect to see growth coming out of our garages and our deployment managers. Then there is a segment which is largely going to be channel ready. So there we do get, as Jim talked about operational leverage, we don't need the other people. The channel is quite capable, but rather put more money into the channel and work with them to go after that. That's the other end of the spectrum. Then there is a set of clients, let's call it between these two spectrums. They tend to buy mostly from one or two parts of IBM. So they deeply value the specialists, but they don't need the generalists who were covering them. So we are going to take that money and as I said pour it into more specialists who can then cover those clients. So there is a first segment which does have a integrated value. There is a, the top half of the second segment which is going to be much more specialists, you can think of them as being technology-led sales by and large. And then there is going to be a large part, which is ecosystem-led, where the system integrators, resellers, distributors, et cetera. We believe that this simplicity is going to drive a lot more outcome for us and for our clients. And by the way, we are also going to ensure that this is the structure that all parts of IBM have. So it's not that different parts of IBM, but how slightly different clients segmentations. It's completely consistent across all. This we believe unlocks a few points of revenue growth. So you said impactful, I expect that this will unlock a few points of revenue growth albeit let me acknowledge that it probably takes six months to flow through the system. Yes, thanks Pat. So we got a lot today. So let me just make a couple of really quick comments to wrap this up. We are confident in our strategy with digging the actions that will accelerate this change. We expect to grow in 2021 with an improving project creep through the year. And with all of that, we will look different at the end of 2021 than we do today. I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you. Thank you everyone."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I want to welcome you to IBM\u2019s Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Presentation. I am here with Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll post today\u2019s prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the Company\u2019s SEC filings. Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue and signings growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, while we have wrapped on the majority of the impacts of the divestitures in 2019 we\u2019ll continue to focus on constant currency growth adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud, and our geographic performance. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. Finally, consistent with our last few quarters, IBM\u2019s year-over-year revenue, profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related impacts associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks Patricia. I\u2019m pleased to be speaking with you again just a week and a half after our strategic update on October 8th. Today, we\u2019ll focus on our third quarter performance, which you\u2019ll see is unchanged from the preliminary results we announced. But I want to start with a summary of our strategic discussion. We are redefining our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. Over the last few years, we have built a solid foundation for hybrid cloud. With the acceleration of the Red Hat platform adoption and the changes to clients\u2019 needs for application versus infrastructure services we are separating our Managed Infrastructure Services into a new publicly traded company. The result is two market leaders with focused strategies and missions and improved growth trajectories. IBM is the number one hybrid cloud platform and AI company. NewCo will become the number one Managed Infrastructure Services company. As separate businesses, each can capitalize on their respective missions. Both will have more agility to focus on their operating and financial models. Both will have greater freedom to partner with others, and both will align their investments and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. All of this will create value for clients and for you, the investors with an improved financial profile of both companies. Since the announcement, we have had a comprehensive outreach to our clients. In fact, we have spoken to hundreds of our top clients and I have personally spoken to dozens. The vast majority understand the strategy and are excited about what it means for them, whether they\u2019ll be predominantly future IBM clients, or NewCo clients. Our partners have also had a positive response, as they see this as an opportunity to further strengthen our go-to-market initiatives in the hybrid cloud, data and AI spaces. For IBM, as we look forward, the case for hybrid cloud is clear. Clients see two-and-a-half times more value in a hybrid cloud approach versus a public-only. It is a tremendous opportunity valued at a trillion dollars with most of the enterprise opportunity ahead of us. Our approach is platform-centric. It is differentiated by Red Hat OpenShift, which is our market-leading open platform, a vast software portfolio modernized to run cloud-native and our GBS expertise that drives platform adoption and meets clients \u201cwhere they are\u201d on their cloud journeys. Over the coming months, we\u2019ll further advance our strategy by taking actions to simplify and optimize our model, increase investments in key areas and fostering much more of a growth mindset. All of this will contribute to accelerated growth for our company in the future and we expect to deliver sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth upon completion of the separation of NewCo. Let me shift to some of the recent progress we have made against our hybrid cloud platform strategy from the perspective of our clients, our ecosystem and innovations we are bringing to market. We have great recent examples of clients making large-scale architectural commitments to our hybrid cloud platform. Schlumberger is using our platform to make their E&P environment accessible across any infrastructure that their global clients use, on-premise, private and public clouds. They\u2019ll enable the broader energy community to leverage data analytics and AI to unleash the power of digital innovation in the oil and gas industry. We are also extending our relationship with Delta to transform their talent and modernize their IT environment using Red Hat, Cloud Paks, and leveraging GBS\u2019 expertise. They\u2019ll operate with greater speed and realize longer- term business benefits. We\u2019re continuing to expand our ecosystem. Last week I talked about how we have added hundreds of partners to drive workloads to our platform, including best-of-breed GSIs and ISVs. As an example, Ernst & Young is now leveraging our open hybrid cloud platform and AI solutions to help clients transform their businesses. Our teams are also providing joint consulting capabilities to drive business outcomes for clients. Late last week, we announced the expansion of our partnership with ServiceNow to bring the power of Watson AIOps to their market leading Now Platform. We are also bringing new innovations to market. I\u2019ll highlight just two areas, Red Hat and Quantum. Red Hat extended its open hybrid cloud portfolio with several new technology introductions, including OpenShift Virtualization, which enables clients to migrate and run their virtual machines natively within Red Hat OpenShift and Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, which delivers the industry\u2019s most robust multi-cluster, policy-based compliance and application management system. These capabilities are furthering our clients' abilities to \"build once, deploy anywhere\" with a hybrid cloud architecture. In Quantum, we announced our roadmap to reach 1,000-plus qubits by 2023. The roadmap aims to take today\u2019s noisy, small-scale devices towards the million-plus qubit devices of the future. This kind of progress is essential to help industry and research organizations tackle important real-world problems that even today\u2019s most powerful classical computers cannot tackle. And in making our roadmap public, we are committing to meet a series of aggressive benchmarks that will help our company maintain its leadership in quantum computing and place our clients on the path to groundbreaking achievements. So we have made good progress with clients, our ecosystem, and innovation. Regarding today\u2019s environment, clients continue to balance short-term challenges and opportunities for transformation. In the short-term they are focused on operational stability and cash preservation. We see this especially in our larger software license transactions and delays in some services projects. But more of my conversations with CEOs are around how they become digital businesses. How do they tap into open source innovation? How can they securely deploy and manage their data and applications across various clouds? That\u2019s what we call hybrid cloud. We see this in the continued momentum in Red Hat and in the large client engagements that enables a journey to cloud, leveraging both OpenShift and application modernization. Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim Kavanaugh, who is going to take you through the results, and then we\u2019ll come back at the end for Q&A.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks Arvind. I\u2019ll start with a view of our overall performance. We delivered $17.6 billion of revenue, expanded gross and pre-tax margins, reported operating earnings per share of $2.58 and generated solid free cash flow, while increasing investments. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have ample liquidity. Our revenue and gross profit performance was fairly consistent with the second quarter and reflects little change in the macroeconomic environment and client demand. As we\u2019ve previously discussed, our broad geographic footprint, and client and portfolio mix provide some stability to our revenue, profit and cash flow. As Arvind just mentioned, clients\u2019 near-term priorities continue to include operational stability, flexibility and cash preservation, which tends to favor OpEx over CapEx. This is resulting in some project delays and purchase deferrals, which we see in perpetual software licenses and project-oriented and volume- based services. Our transactional performance this quarter also reflects product cycle dynamics in our Systems business. At the same time, the last seven months have made it very clear that companies need to modernize their businesses to succeed in this new normal. This is leading to an acceleration in digital transformations. Cloud and AI are at the center of these transformations and our open, platform- centric model delivers greater innovation, higher productivity and more strategic optionality to our clients. In the third quarter, client adoption of our platform continued to grow with approximately 2,600 clients now using our container solutions. We anniversaried the acquisition of Red Hat in early July and Red Hat again delivered strong results in the period with normalized revenue growth of 16%. Red Hat leverages IBM\u2019s global reach and large account incumbency. Not only are the number of large deals increasing, but also the size of these engagements is increasing as well with the total value of these deals doubling over the last 12 months. Within services, this quarter we added about 125 services clients utilizing Red Hat technology and our GBS cloud-related signings were up over 25%. The platform model delivers compelling economics. Our full-stack capabilities drove over $24 billion of cloud revenue over the last 12 months, which is up 25%. We are investing to expand our capabilities in GBS skills centered on hybrid cloud and intelligent workflows, in Red Hat\u2019s go-to-market to drive hybrid cloud adoption, in software hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, including the Spanugo and WDG Automation acquisitions, in IBM cloud capital for MZR build outs and in our ecosystem to drive adoption of OpenShift and our broader cloud capabilities. These investments will accelerate in 2021, given the additional flexibility from our structural actions. This quarter, our portfolio mix with strong software contribution together with our focus on productivity, drove operating gross margin expansion of 160 basis points and operating pre-tax margin expansion of 140 basis points. With a 10 point year-to-year headwind in our operating tax rate, our net income margin was essentially flat. Our cash and liquidity positions remain strong fueled by our cash flow. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $4.8 billion year-to-date, which is down over $1 billion year-to-year. We continue to have strong working capital performance and contribution from Red Hat, net of related interest. These were offset by higher net capital expenditures and workforce rebalancing payments. Over the last year, we generated $10.8 billion of free cash flow, which is 136% of GAAP net income. We ended September with a cash balance of $15.8 billion, which is up $6.7 billion since year end, while our debt was up $2.5 billion. I\u2019ll remind you we issued debt earlier this year, out of an abundance of caution and taking advantage of attractive market dynamics. We are in good shape to fund our upcoming maturities including $4 billion to $5 billion in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ll end 2020 with debt down for the year. Now, I\u2019ll turn to the segment performance beginning with Cloud and Cognitive Software. Revenue was up 6% driven by Cloud and Data platforms. This is a sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance, despite a four-point headwind from the wrap on the Red Hat acquisition in early July. Software has a seasonally smaller transactional base in the third quarter. In a challenging transactional environment, this benefited us. Our Cloud and Data Platforms delivered 19% revenue growth. This was led by Red Hat\u2019s strong performance with double-digit growth across both Infrastructure software and Application Development and emerging technologies. A couple of weeks ago, Red Hat was recognized as the leader in multi-cloud container development platforms in Forrester\u2019s latest Wave report. Leveraging this OpenShift container platform, our AI- powered Cloud Paks provide clients with ease of use and the ability to scale and secure operations across a variety of environments. We are expanding and leveraging the IBM and Red Hat ecosystems with over 180 partners now selling IBM Cloud Paks. We\u2019re seeing good penetration in our large accounts. We\u2019ve now more than tripled the number of clients adopting Cloud Paks versus a year ago and added nearly 200 clients to our container platforms in the third quarter. Cognitive Applications revenue trajectory improved to flat year-to-year led by strength in Security and Supply Chain. In Security, we had good demand for our Threat Management software and services as clients transform and manage their security operations. We are driving adoption of our CloudPak for Security and QRadar on Cloud and Identity and Trust services also had good performance as we\u2019re helping clients with their secure digital transformations. Forrester and IDC just named our Managed Security Services as an industry leader, based on our integrated product and services capabilities. We also had good performance in our Supply Chain software. Supply Chain Order Management enables the shift to more flexible and scalable digital channels, which is a great value prop to our clients during the pandemic. Looking at the profit for this segment, we had strong profit and margin performance driven primarily by Red Hat contribution. Turning to Global Business Services, revenue declined 6%, consistent with last quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, prior to the pandemic, GBS was growing revenue and signings. Since March, our revenue has reflected the economic environment and a change in client priorities leading to project delays, and less demand for more discretionary offerings. But as we pivot our offerings and delivery to address these client needs, GBS posted double-digit signings growth in the third quarter, and returned its backlog to growth. This was driven by cloud strategy, application development and modernization and offerings that use data and AI to transform workflows. As I mentioned earlier, our GBS cloud signings were up over 25%.We signed a number of large transformational contracts with a total value greater than $100 million, which will yield revenue over time. Our small deal performance generally followed the pandemic curve by geography, but returned to growth overall for the quarter. With the expertise and process knowledge gained through our application management incumbency, clients trust us to guide them through architectural decisions and facilitate their transformations with a particular expertise in application modernization at scale across all on-prem, private, and public cloud environments. GBS drives adoption of IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud platform and is a gateway to bring the wider set of IBM capabilities to enable a client\u2019s digital journey. For example, about one-third of Cloud Pak revenue results from GBS engagements and, this quarter, we added another 60 Red Hat client engagements with such clients as Delta Airlines, which Arvind mentioned earlier, but also Royal Bank of Canada, IT Ergo, Florida Power and Light and Telefonica Espana. As our clients are transforming, we are also investing in our GBS business to position for growth in the future. We are continuing to invest in skills, resources, offerings and ecosystems. We have implemented a virtual sales engagement model and are delivering nearly all of our more than 1,500 active paid Garage engagements virtually. And, we are taking the learnings from our initial shift to remote delivery to establish a new delivery model. Dynamic Delivery integrates technical foundations with virtualized methods and practices, enhanced with AI and automation to drive productivity, pace and quality. As we apply the Dynamic Delivery principles across our client base, in the third quarter we delivered more than 90% of our services remotely, while maintaining stable quality and increasing Net Promoter Score. Looking at the profit dynamics, with our focus on high value offerings, productivity and strong operational discipline, we expanded GBS gross margin by 190 basis points. In Global Technology Services, revenue was down 4%, fairly consistent with last quarter. Infrastructure Services continues to experience lower client-based business volumes in the more economically sensitive industries and TSS performance reflects hardware product cycles and continuing volume impacts due to the pandemic. But many clients are taking a longer-term view and are looking to modernize their infrastructure to create agility and operational efficiency. They turn to GTS\u2019 Managed Infrastructure Services business for its deep expertise in managing mission-critical infrastructures and its next-generation service delivery capabilities infused with AI and automation. Coca-Cola European Partners is a great example. We recently signed a multi-year agreement to accelerate their modernization journey. We\u2019ll help them to reduce operational expenses, increase IT resiliency and leverage AI to bring enhanced insights and deliver greater service to their customers. GTS\u2019 signings were down 1% this quarter, but up 12% year to date with 19 deals over $100 million, including eight this quarter. In addition to new work, clients continue to make long-term commitments with significant contract renewals as we deliver new value. This has resulted in the backlog year-to-year trajectory improving by approximately two points from the beginning of the year. Turning to GTS profit, gross margin declined by roughly 80 basis points. This was driven by the investments we are making in public cloud and the volume impacts which come at a high margin. Turning to Systems, revenue was down 16%, driven primarily by product cycle dynamics. IBM Z revenue was down 20%. We launched the z15 toward the end of the third quarter last year. We\u2019ve had widespread adoption of both z15 and LinuxONE across many industries and countries in support of clients\u2019 hybrid cloud journeys. IBM Z is seeing record-setting volumes on Linux as clients leverage Red Hat OpenShift, Ansible and our cloud native dev ops offerings. At the same time, this pandemic has impacted our historical IBM Z cycle dynamics, which is playing out differently by industry. This platform has proved invaluable to our clients in areas like banking and financial markets, helping them rapidly and remotely scale up capacity and respond to unprecedented market volatility. As a result, these clients accelerated their adoption of z15 within the cycle. That said, in many other industries, clients remain focused on cash preservation during this pandemic. This dichotomy in client buying behaviors impacted our performance in the third quarter and will lengthen the adoption curve of this z15 cycle. But by the end of this cycle, we have an opportunity to be fairly consistent with prior cycles. I\u2019ll remind you, in the fourth quarter, we\u2019ll be wrapping on very strong performance from last year when we were up 63%. These cycle dynamics impacted our storage revenue as well with performance driven by declines in high-end storage. Now, as always, before the Q&A, I\u2019ll bring it back up to the IBM level. We are seeing tremendous opportunity to help our clients become digital businesses. Our technology-centric hybrid cloud platform, deep industry expertise and growing ecosystem are enabling us to accelerate these transformations. The value we provide clients is evident this quarter in our cloud revenue growth, in our continued momentum in Red Hat, and in our strong GBS signings driven by cloud and application modernization offerings. And now we are accelerating IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud platform strategy with increased focus and investments to drive future growth. We are taking structural actions to simplify and streamline our business and as we discussed earlier this month, we expect a fourth quarter charge to our operating results of about $2.3 billion. The savings from these actions will be reinvested in areas like hybrid cloud, data and AI, security, and emerging technologies. With our focused hybrid cloud platform strategy and the increased investments starting now, we expect to drive sustainable mid-single-digit growth after the separation of NewCo is complete. In the near-term, the rate and pace of recovery remains uncertain and as a consequence, we have not seen a fundamental shift in overall demand levels. Given this uncertainty, and consistent with our direction for most of this year, we are not going to provide guidance. But I will remind you, from an historical perspective, the fourth quarter seasonally is our strongest quarter in terms of revenue and operating earnings per share due to our high value software and hardware transactions. Looking at our year-to-year dynamics at the end of 2020, we are wrapping on a strong fourth quarter of 2019, when we had a very strong software performance, our first full quarter of z15 availability and our first full quarter of Red Hat contribution. So, going into this fourth quarter, as always, we have a lot of work to do. It\u2019s our largest transactional quarter, we\u2019ll be focusing our investments in hybrid cloud and AI and of course we\u2019re starting the detailed work to separate our Managed Infrastructure Services business. We are confident in the focus and direction of our business and what it means for our future. Arvind, let me turn it back over to you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks Jim. I am going to add just one final thought before the Q&A. We are managing for the long-term. We are making strategic decisions, taking actions and increasing investments today to better position our business and accelerate our top-line growth, on a sustainable basis. Patricia, let\u2019s go to the Q&A.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Arvind. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we\u2019ve included supplemental information at the end of the presentation. And finally, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions. Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you very much. Arvind, you touched on this briefly during your prepared remarks. I was wondering if you could expand a little bit more on the health of the wider IT spending landscape you are seeing around the world and you mentioned delays you are seeing in a couple of areas within the portfolio. Just wondering when you think those deals will start coming through, particularly they are starting to think about the puts and takes heading into 2021.\nArvind Krishna: All right. So first, thanks for the question, Matt. So, a few comments on \u2013 because you ask about portfolio areas, you also ask about clients and you also ask about geographies. And it all varies. But we are seeing first from large client deals, as well as services projects. Let me just reiterate, but add a little bit of color to what Jim and I said in our prepared remarks. While we are seeing very healthy growth in some parts of both software and systems, it\u2019s kind of \u2013 it\u2019s frantic, but we are also seeing people pause. Now maybe they are pausing because of their industry or because of geography or because they are into a cash conservation mode, we think it\u2019s a pause. We don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a decline forever. We do believe that some of those deals come back and we tend to see that. We saw that from the first to the second, second to the third quarter et cetera. So, that\u2019s a one part. Now, we have also talked about that there is about a 70% of the industries that we are in, we are not seeing any pause as we see clients there are healthy. We see that their businesses are healthy. About 30% and that should not be a surprise to anybody in this call, we do tend to see some temporary softness and maybe think about brick and mortar retail, you think about airlines, you think about hospitality, I think it\u2019s not a surprise that some of those. Now, we also tend to be with larger clients. So we don\u2019t believe that they have a sustainability issue by and large. It will tend to come back. So that\u2019s out of the flavor under it. But then as I begin to look forward, Matt, because you are asking that question also, it\u2019s really hard to predict the fourth quarter. That\u2019s why Jim and I are pausing on giving guidance here. However when we look at our people interested in these parts of the software portfolio, whether it\u2019s supply chain and security as Jim mentioned, whether it\u2019s cloud and data platform which is inclusive both of Red Hat and our cloud packs and all the technologies they find essential, we find that those will come back. We find our transaction processing platform or TPP yet somewhat aligned to the mainframe capacity increases as those go through you tend to see, I\u2019ll call it an alignment. It\u2019s not necessarily identical but there is some alignment therein. And then, let\u2019s not forget that as a Global Business Services and other SIs do transformation projects, they also tend to pull through software more in cloud and data platform there in other areas. So, I\u2019ll sort of give you that color sort of across the client set, across the industries and across different parts of the portfolio, Matt.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Matt. Can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hi. Thank you so much. It looks like services hirings did bounce back nicely little bit here. So, it sounds like some larger transactions coming back. What I am understanding, maybe if you don\u2019t mind just this transition from going with the tighter integration of GBS and GTS to the separation now. Can we see services results and bookings maybe weaken in the short-term before taken up again. I know the signings were good here, but just trying to think about this fourth quarter and first quarter transition given the changeover but that makes sense. Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, Tien-tsin, this is Jim. I\u2019ll take that one. Let\u2019s talk a little bit about the quarter in what we just finished with regards to services signings. We\u2019re pretty pleased given the overall macroeconomic environment and the rate and pace and the continued uncertainty. The teams executed very well, $9.5 billion of signings, up 5%. We got a $108 billion backlog right now that\u2019s flat at actual rates, down 1% at constant currency. And to your point, we saw actually very good progress in large transformational deals. I think 11 in the quarter in excess of $100 million and eight of those in our GTS Manage Infrastructure Services business which saw a very strong renewal rate that talks to the value of innovation that they bring to our client set overall and that has led to year-to-date, I think we said in the prepared remarks, GTS up 12% signings and I\u2019ll remind you, that was off of a third quarter last year while we grew 20%. So we are pretty pleased there and that\u2019s led to a two point backlog improvement in our GTS business since January. But what we really have seen a marked inflection of some signs of demand change is in GBS. And you know while the revenue kind of played out consistent with 2Q, our signings were up double-digits, I think it was our third largest signings quarter almost in history and our both large and small deals overall and that was really a testament to our GBS capability around application modernization and being our clients\u2019 provider of choice for digital transformation and journey to cloud. So, we feel pretty good about that. It\u2019s good early trends. We got a very nice pipeline of transformational deals here in the fourth quarter and again, given our announcement ten days ago, we are spending a lot of time with our clients to make sure we minimize disruption, ensure stability and provide that client value going forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Tien-tsin. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I know you are not commenting on Q4 guidance, but maybe you can tell us how to think about it. Typical seasonality might be for revenue up about $3 billion if demand is not really changing, why shouldn\u2019t we assume normal seasonality and is that kind of the right number or framework? And then, Arvind, I am wondering if you could just comment on capital allocation going forward? Your dividend is $6 billion a year. It\u2019s basically been a 100% a year free cash flow year-to-date in the last \u2013 you haven\u2019t paid down any debt. You haven\u2019t done any deals without taking on incremental debt this year. So if you really are managing the business for the long-term and growth is a priority, are you considering lowering or suspending the dividend or is the dividend safe? And if it is, why wouldn\u2019t you be more aggressive in allocating more cash to growth going forward? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Toni, this is Jim. Thanks for the question, multi-part. But let me take the first piece around, color around fourth quarter and then, Arvind can handle the capital allocation discussion around the strategy and I have to see if I can handle some of the numbers overall. But first, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, and you indicated the rate and pace of the recovery we still see is uncertain. And there is no real fundamental change in client buying priorities around cash preservation, around operational stability and consistent with prior quarters, that has led us to not give guidance. But, let me give you some color. First, we talked about at the onsite of COVID-19 that this has only accelerated our clients\u2019 digital transformation and journey to the cloud and you see that playing out in our results over the last few quarters with continued very good momentum in our cloud business and in our Red Hat business. And when we look at fourth quarter, we see very healthy pipelines in hybrid cloud, AI solutions, App modernization, Cloud Transformation Services within GBS, Red Hat actual backlog growth is accelerating, up 23% at $4.7 billion and we see pretty healthy pipelines in our cloud and data platform and in our Cognitive Apps business led by Cloud Paks and Security. The two things that we called out though in our prepared remarks that we talked about the last few quarters and those are headwinds. And first in particular around TPP, our clients committed to that platform. We had a very strong 2019 and given the environment and the focus on cash preservation, we don\u2019t see that coming back in the fourth quarter and it\u2019s going to be pretty similar to the first half. And the second is our mainframe cycle coming off with a significant portion of the growth last year up 63%. So when you look at skew overall, in the fourth quarter, 3Q to 4Q, yes, I mean, there will be no reason not to expect a normal skew with regards to revenue. Some slight improvement in our software portfolio offset by TPP and we\u2019ll wrap on the hardware piece. Now in terms of EPS, you saw the very strong fundamentals in third quarter coming off of strong 2Q. Operating gross margins up 160 basis points, operating pretax margin up 140 basis points. We feel very confident in the strength of our balance sheet, our cash and liquidity position to make sure that we can continue to invest in our business. We are starting that immediately here in fourth quarter around technology, around innovation, around skills, around capabilities, and you\u2019ll see that play out in addition to the $2.3 billion structural charge. So, when you look at EPS, you all know the numbers, as well as I do. Over the last x number of years, our 3Q to 4Q pre the $2.3 billion charge has been a nice growth of about 50 \u2013 mid-50s. We should do maybe a little bit better than that, but I don\u2019t think anything substantial about that. So, we see pretty similar dynamics. Arvind, over to you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. And Toni, thank you for asking the capital allocation question. A really important piece of our growth strategy going forward. So a couple of points there for context; one, when we acquired and closed on Red Hat, we did commit to pausing share repurchase until we have deleveraged and gotten back to our target ratios of debt-to-EBITDA. So we are on track to do that. We fully intend to do that and we had said that we will get there by 2022. So that\u2019s part one. And so some of the cash you see in the balance sheet will be used towards that purpose because you said you are not paying down that, but you\u2019ll see us begin to pay that down to get towards those ratios, part one. Part two, we are committed to a stable and growing dividend. Our dividend to our investors given that how much they depend upon that and how much you have heard about that and feedback, we intend to keep a stable and growing dividend. That means, everything else is up for what is prudent for managing for the long-term. And so, when we talk about increased investments, and on October 8th I was clear, we are going to both increase expenses organically in order to be able to grow in both software and in GBS, but we are also going to be quite acquisitive in the areas that we have called out. We will be acquisitive in GBS and we will also be acquisitive in the software areas around hybrid cloud, data AI, security and in emerging technologies such as Quantum. So, when you see us do that, I think we are going to be doing exactly what you are asking. We will be allocating more cash to growth going forward. I think the simple answer to that is, yes, with no qualifications therein.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Toni. Can we go to the next question please, Sheila?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. The second half was going to deliver some strong margin uplift from the productivity actions and we saw some of that come through in the third quarter. Can you help us with how much more productivity benefit is yet to come in the fourth quarter? And as you talk about the reinvestment of the savings associated with the actions you just announced last week, can you give us a segment view on that reinvestment please? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. So, Wamsi, thank you very much for the question overall. If you look at the structural actions we took as we entered 2020, remember we talked a lot about this in January, pre-COVID on how we were going to reposition our businesses as we move forward. You see that actually playing out in our results. I mean, our margins in the second quarter were up roughly 150 basis points at gross margin level, and in third quarter we just came off margins that are up 160 basis points at the gross level and operating margins that are up 140 basis points at the pretax level. So, I think you are seeing that productivity and the fundamental change and the way we are actually driving and running the business now adapting given the onset of COVID-19 and the implications to the economic environment. If you take a look at the fourth quarter actions overall, we talked about ten days ago the strategic action around separating out and creating two market-leading companies and creating an independent publicly traded company around our Managed Infrastructure Services business, that was going to be about a $2.3 billion charge. And if you remember what I said at the time and you can kind of think of this is in one-third buckets. The first is about a third of that is going to go to help improve the EBITDA growth profile in our NewCo business to be on a trajectory to achieve post separation of double-digit EBITDA growth profile. The second bucket or second third of that was, in any business when you separate out, you are going to create stranded cost and inefficiency and we are committed to addressing that in 2021 with this charge. And then the third piece is, we are making significant investments to capitalize on the $1 trillion hybrid cloud market opportunity and the third bucket is going to be used for additional fin flex. That is going to be centered around technology, innovation, people, skills, capability, ecosystems and also as Arvind just answered, around inorganic place overall. So, I\u2019ll take that one and then Arvind, do you want to take the second one?\nArvind Krishna: Yes. So, when you look at the different segments that we are in, Wamsi, so this is straightaway in the four areas that we had outlined. Number one, we are going to be increasing investments in GBS in order to get more skills in the areas that we are seeing demand. Second, we are going to be increasing investments in our ecosystem and ecosystems that are large partners, we just announced ServiceNow last week, but we announced Adobe a couple of months before that. You\u2019ve seen us with Salesforce, you\u2019ve seen us with others. So we are going to be increasing our investments in how we work with those. But there are also hundreds of ISVs, not just the very large ones, it\u2019s one we are also working to get them on our hybrid cloud platform, on our cloud properties and so how do we invest in that in order to drive growth down the road is a second piece. I\u2019ll put that in the ecosystem bucket. Third, we are going to be increasing investments in our core software areas in terms of the hybrid cloud platform itself and you saw that in some of my prepared remarks on the innovations we are driving into the Red Hat technologies, but in addition to that in terms of data and AI, in security and others, we are going to drive innovation in there. And as you put all those areas together, let\u2019s not also forget, NewCo is also going to be seeing increased investments around automation, around infrastructure modernization against looking the different cloud partners. So when you think of those four buckets, it now goes pretty much across all of IBM\u2019s segments, Wamsi, if you think about it, because we wanted to be, I\u2019ll call it balance, it\u2019s not identical growth, but we want all of the segments to be contributing to growth and so we got to be driving in terms of organic R&D, in terms of working with certain areas where there is a lot of demand. So you got to get skills in there and of course, as we add M&A, that\u2019s not quite directly from these buckets of money, but the M&A will also add to added expenses eventually while the moment you complete an acquisition as expense in these different segments.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Wamsi. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Next we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your may proceed.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Arvind, just looking at the cloud and cognitive software business, before you closed on the Red Hat acquisition, that was a growing business. Today, on a pro forma basis with Red Hat it\u2019s declining mid-single-digits. Would love your thoughts on why we are not seeing a stronger growth rate. Is it entirely macro-driven? And whether the steps and timeline for getting that software business back to pro forma growth given how important it is to hitting those mid-single-digit longer-term growth target?\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Katy. And you got it correct. It is a critical part of us getting towards a mid-single-digit growth target. So, that is essential. So, as we begin to go under it and you look at it for the last few months, I would tell you that some of it is indeed maximally the wrong word, but I think as there is two elements in there. People are pausing certain large software license transactions and that is perhaps the macro environment and then there is the TPP piece which is inside of the software segment which is driven more as I\u2019ve said before in terms of the alignment to the mainframe capacity that\u2019s in the ground. So we saw very good growth in the fourth quarter or last year we saw that tied to that and as you begin to see that slowdown in the third quarter of this year, we do expect to \u2013 I think see that continue for some time. But within that, when I look at our Cognitive Applications and we look at cloud and data platform, we do see healthy growth there, but I expect to see continue. As we invest more into that, and as we invest more into Red Hat, I would expect that as we get through the next year, we are going to see that that should be able to more than offset anything that happens in TPP. And just to give a sense of that, Katy, when you begin to look at Red Hat by itself, and we see the growth there in the mid-to-high teens, and we expect that that should be able to continue and accelerate, then that in turn will give added growth to the whole portfolio more than enough to offset any weakness in TPP and then as you are increasing our investment in our ecosystem, as well as in internal R&D as well as in acquisitions, while I\u2019ll acknowledge that those do take multiple quarters to play out. I wish it was quicker, but it is multiple quarters, but I would fully expect it at the same time as we complete the spin, we should be able to see those growth return in those parts of the portfolio and you got to fence of how we\u2019ll do it across those various elements.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Katy. Sheila, can we take the next question please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Arvind, I would love to just hear the feedback you\u2019ve gotten from your customers over the last ten days post the announcement of defense and it is pretty what I am kind of thinking about as the - pause in signing longer term deals so the spin is done and that could get perhaps that applies or spend growth. So, just any feedback over there would be helpful.\nArvind Krishna: Yes, great question, Amit. So, as you can imagine, this is something in which I think the only word I can use is, we are obsessive about this topic. We had our lists out. We knew exactly of what clients might be concerned about and I wouldn\u2019t say that we are 100% perfect, but I think we feel very, very good that we were correct in our estimations of the level of concerns. To you give you a sense, we sort of internally, this is not something that we also tell the client, but based on the reaction, I mentioned that we already spoken to hundreds. So you can think that but now that we are ten days in, we have already spoken to at least between two and three hundred of the top clients where there is a strong intersection or where there is a very heavy SPINCO revenue base or deals that could be on the table. And from there, we have gotten back over 80% our corridor in the great to good to not really concerned. And I\u2019ll come back and give some color on why we believe that\u2019s true. Then there are some \u2013 we\u2019ll do enough on both sides that they do have some concerns. Both of those concerns are around, who is team that will be providing service. Who is the person whose going to be on the ground and we should be very clear that SPINCO is going to head out on day one with $19, the same management team on the ground who runs it from the client up is going to be team that does it. Yes, it\u2019s a corporate structure that we\u2019ve put in place, but that\u2019s not the team on the ground, just to be clear. They have very high satisfaction with the majority of their clients and that is because they bring both service excellence in terms of the service and the upturn that they provide, but also they bring very deep technical skills which is kind of gives them permission and the trust to play. So, when I put all of that together, I think that there is a couple of dozen clients where we just have to make sure that we can tell them who is the team there is going to be servicing them and as they begin to get comfort on that, I can see the level of anxiety reduce. But as I said, over 80%, they understood what was happening and also many clients the majority on one or the other of naturally for them there is going to be less of a concern. Now, to your point on why would they complete the deals. Look most of the larger deals are to our clients\u2019 benefit. We don\u2019t do something unless they are going to get a business benefit from that and in this environment if you want to go pause that for three or six months, you are going to defer your benefit for three to six months. So, I think what drives things and luckily they have a month to sort of on both side, both our team as they find to sort of understand each other then there is still enough time in the quarter to go get those deals done. So, the quarter will tell us whether we are right or not. But based on everything I can see, I am confident that actually we\u2019ll be able to see most of the deals progress to a satisfactory conclusion.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Amit. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. So, I know the end-markets have shifted quickly and I think I understand the challenges associated with reposition that Q2, that\u2019s as I am having a harder time calibrating how you are thinking about the longer-term growth prospects for this business. Can you give us any insight into your analysis of the longer-term growth of the business? And what it really means to run it for cash flow? Does that simply mean that it continues to decline at a modest rate and generate cash or does that mean something totally different?\nArvind Krishna: Hi, David. Look, the market is a $500 billion market from what we can see, from what IDC shows us, as well as what many other third-party consultants has told us. A couple of things in there. Within that, if I find where is our portfolio and our clients today, is probably more heavily weighted and about 60% of that total as opposed to all of it. And we think that the ability to form many more partnerships as standalone is going to allow IX to much more fully participate in the complete market. Two, we have waited pretty consistently that we are going to start them off with a investment-grade balance sheet. That should allow them to also make targeted acquisitions as appropriate. We can\u2019t speak for that and we up to the management team post spin. But that is a place we are always in a market where it\u2019s a scale game. That\u2019s definitely a way that you can both grow and gain market share. And so, two, three, Jim mentioned that a third of the restructuring charge is for also improving the EBITDA profile of the spin company. That is going to allow them to also invest in new offerings in areas such as cloud modernization, as well as added offerings in aspects of compliance and security and resilience and also in much more automation which is going to allow them to deliver even higher service delivery excellence to their clients. So when I look across all those, the opportunity is certainly there. And freeing them up to deals which we might not do, because the margin maybe dilutive to us, but it\u2019s going to be accretive towards the new company, two possibly M&A down the road, but that\u2019s not for some time. And three, in terms of leveraging new offerings and partnerships with other companies who might be doing it, but maybe not as wholeheartedly as they would do it with an independent company.\nPatricia Murphy: Great. Thank you, David. And let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your may proceed.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Many thanks for taking the question and congratulations on the ongoing success of Red Hat. I actually wanted to ask a clarification question, Jim. Arvind, on a clarification, I wanted to come back to M&A, you seem to be talking more about M&A on this calls and in previous calls, and per previous question, I am just not sure the financial resources now that you have to be aggressive about M&A in that IBM typically generate between $12 billion and $13 billion of free cash flow and if you have $6 billion dividend payment, it just doesn\u2019t leave a lot of room for M&A. So is the message that you may look to get away from an investment-grade rating? I am just \u2013 I am not sure how to make the math work when you say impactful and then, I\u2019ll just ask my question to Jim, if I could. Jim, you talked about GBS and how you are confident of growth there. I certainly think consulting business can improve, particularly next year as we get into presumably better economic cycles. Yet application management and global process have \u2013 where we before the pandemic hit and in fact \u2013 not had been growth challenges through 2019. And so, I just want to hear a little about those two businesses. What are your expectations on an organic basis when you think about GBS for roughly half the revenues that frankly were pretty growth challenged before the pandemic? That\u2019s it. Many thanks.\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay, Keith. Actually, Arvind, if you don\u2019t mind, let me take both. As I think part of the first question, you\u2019ve already answered from a strategic capital allocation perspective on what we want to do with regards to our investment profile both organically and inorganically. But Keith, the heart of your question gets to a mathematical equation. And I think, one, first, you got to recognize that there is always been seasonality in our free cash flow albeit we delivered $4.8 billion year-to-date in free cash flow overall, as you all know quite well, well over 50% of our free cash flow in this business comes in the fourth quarter. That, coupled with, we talked about two quarters ago at the onset of COVID-19 how the business model composition of IBM with its geographic diversification, its industry composition, its client segmentation, be a more large enterprise focus and its annuity content of both high value software, high value hardware platform and high value services piece provides a natural hedge in this environment the stability around revenue, profit and cash. Now, yes, over the last couple of years we\u2019ve been driving around $12 billion of free cash flow in light of the economic challenges due to COVID-19, that number just trajectory-wise will be less this year. We\u2019ll see how fourth quarter plays out. But we are very confident in our portfolio, in fact even more confident given the decision that Arvind and the entire IBM team and our Board made on October 8th around repositioning two market-leading companies. One within IBM and an accelerated growth profile with an already very strong EBITDA margin business that is going to generate significant cash and then two, a lead in the market-leading infrastructure services business that is 2x the next competitor and in that business as you all understand quite well, is a scale economics business. So, from that aspect, I think when you look at our fin flex, our fin flex only gets better and with our disciplined financial capital allocation policy that this company operates on, we feel very comfortable that we got ample free cash flow to invest in our business organically and inorganically to delever and hit those targeted leverage ratios and also to maintain our return to shareholder program with a secure dividend and sustainable dividend growth policy overall. So that\u2019s the first question. Second question, when you look at GBS, as I talked about, we did see signs of demand improvement here in the third quarter and if you remember 90 days ago, we talked about the first half of second quarter and the second half of second quarter in the month of June and we saw some nice growth in June. While that continued into the third quarter where double-digit signings growth overall and by the way, Keith, that was pretty pervasive. That was good growth in consulting, but it was led by large transformational deals around application services in this environment to capitalize on our clients\u2019 journey to cloud. That then drag listed our global process services where clients are now digitally reinventing themselves in how they run their companies around intelligent workflows. So we are seeing that demand inflection move now. To your question, that revenue is more long-term as we play out. But when we look at our current backlog and our current backlog runout for our GBS business, in 2021, we see GBS getting back to pre-COVID growth rates by mid-year and a big chunk of that is improvement across all the three sub-segments.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Keith. Sheila, let\u2019s take one last question please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup Investment Research. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. A pretty clear easy question here is, you\u2019ve talked and highlighted IBM\u2019s significant cash flow strengths and I believe it\u2019s the high priorities of paying down debt to get closer to investment-grade and then the spin out of the company and get it well positioned. Post all that is the focus mostly on dividend and M&A and we should think about stock buyback as being less of a feature compared to past history of IBM or a lot of EPS growth has been driven by stock buyback, but it seems like perhaps maybe the view is that the management and the Board think that the stock buyback isn\u2019t generating shareholder returns. So they\u2019d be shifting more towards M&A. Is that the way to kind of read the last half hour we heard through the Q&A?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, Jim. This is Jim. Let me take that and then I could wrap it up with Arvind overall. As you know quite well, our disciplined capital allocation process first and foremost focuses on how we reinvest back in our business both organically and inorganically and we are focused now with the strategic move that we announced. We laid the foundation we talked on October 8th. We laid that foundation over the last couple of years, instantiated in the Red Had acquisition which was a bold move. We have been building and accelerating that growth. Now we want to capitalize on that $1 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity. Now with that said, just given our investor mix, outside of allocating capital and investment to our own business, when we have excess cash, we are going to return that back to shareholders. That priority right now is our secure dividend and sustainable growth policy and as we get back to our targeted leverage ratios, at that point in time we\u2019ll reevaluate share repurchase. But there is no need talking about that right now.\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Thanks, Jim. Look, just to reiterate, we have talked about growth. We have talked about a maniacal obsession on hybrid cloud and AI as the engines of growth for the company. But let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the discussion. We are certain on our direction even in these uncertain times. And we are laser focused on helping our clients with their digital transformation leveraging our hybrid cloud technology platform, our incumbency, and our expertise. And the actions we are taking starting now in the fourth quarter will enhance our focus and accelerate our future growth and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you.\nPatricia Murphy: Sheila, can we turn it back to you to close out the call please?\nOperator: Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks Arvind. I'll start with a view of our overall performance. We delivered $17.6 billion of revenue, expanded gross and pre-tax margins, reported operating earnings per share of $2.58 and generated solid free cash flow, while increasing investments. Our balance sheet remains strong and we continue to have ample liquidity. Our revenue and gross profit performance was fairly consistent with the second quarter and reflects little change in the macroeconomic environment and client demand. As we've previously discussed, our broad geographic footprint, and client and portfolio mix provide some stability to our revenue, profit and cash flow. As Arvind just mentioned, clients' near-term priorities continue to include operational stability, flexibility and cash preservation, which tends to favor OpEx over CapEx. This is resulting in some project delays and purchase deferrals, which we see in perpetual software licenses and project-oriented and volume- based services. Our transactional performance this quarter also reflects product cycle dynamics in our Systems business. At the same time, the last seven months have made it very clear that companies need to modernize their businesses to succeed in this new normal. This is leading to an acceleration in digital transformations. Cloud and AI are at the center of these transformations and our open, platform- centric model delivers greater innovation, higher productivity and more strategic optionality to our clients. In the third quarter, client adoption of our platform continued to grow with approximately 2,600 clients now using our container solutions. We anniversaried the acquisition of Red Hat in early July and Red Hat again delivered strong results in the period with normalized revenue growth of 16%. Red Hat leverages IBM's global reach and large account incumbency. Not only are the number of large deals increasing, but also the size of these engagements is increasing as well with the total value of these deals doubling over the last 12 months. Within services, this quarter we added about 125 services clients utilizing Red Hat technology and our GBS cloud-related signings were up over 25%. The platform model delivers compelling economics. Our full-stack capabilities drove over $24 billion of cloud revenue over the last 12 months, which is up 25%. We are investing to expand our capabilities in GBS skills centered on hybrid cloud and intelligent workflows, in Red Hat's go-to-market to drive hybrid cloud adoption, in software hybrid cloud and AI capabilities, including the Spanugo and WDG Automation acquisitions, in IBM cloud capital for MZR build outs and in our ecosystem to drive adoption of OpenShift and our broader cloud capabilities. These investments will accelerate in 2021, given the additional flexibility from our structural actions. This quarter, our portfolio mix with strong software contribution together with our focus on productivity, drove operating gross margin expansion of 160 basis points and operating pre-tax margin expansion of 140 basis points. With a 10 point year-to-year headwind in our operating tax rate, our net income margin was essentially flat. Our cash and liquidity positions remain strong fueled by our cash flow. We generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $4.8 billion year-to-date, which is down over $1 billion year-to-year. We continue to have strong working capital performance and contribution from Red Hat, net of related interest. These were offset by higher net capital expenditures and workforce rebalancing payments. Over the last year, we generated $10.8 billion of free cash flow, which is 136% of GAAP net income. We ended September with a cash balance of $15.8 billion, which is up $6.7 billion since year end, while our debt was up $2.5 billion. I'll remind you we issued debt earlier this year, out of an abundance of caution and taking advantage of attractive market dynamics. We are in good shape to fund our upcoming maturities including $4 billion to $5 billion in the fourth quarter. We'll end 2020 with debt down for the year. Now, I'll turn to the segment performance beginning with Cloud and Cognitive Software. Revenue was up 6% driven by Cloud and Data platforms. This is a sequential improvement in the year-to-year performance, despite a four-point headwind from the wrap on the Red Hat acquisition in early July. Software has a seasonally smaller transactional base in the third quarter. In a challenging transactional environment, this benefited us. Our Cloud and Data Platforms delivered 19% revenue growth. This was led by Red Hat's strong performance with double-digit growth across both Infrastructure software and Application Development and emerging technologies. A couple of weeks ago, Red Hat was recognized as the leader in multi-cloud container development platforms in Forrester's latest Wave report. Leveraging this OpenShift container platform, our AI- powered Cloud Paks provide clients with ease of use and the ability to scale and secure operations across a variety of environments. We are expanding and leveraging the IBM and Red Hat ecosystems with over 180 partners now selling IBM Cloud Paks. We're seeing good penetration in our large accounts. We've now more than tripled the number of clients adopting Cloud Paks versus a year ago and added nearly 200 clients to our container platforms in the third quarter. Cognitive Applications revenue trajectory improved to flat year-to-year led by strength in Security and Supply Chain. In Security, we had good demand for our Threat Management software and services as clients transform and manage their security operations. We are driving adoption of our CloudPak for Security and QRadar on Cloud and Identity and Trust services also had good performance as we're helping clients with their secure digital transformations. Forrester and IDC just named our Managed Security Services as an industry leader, based on our integrated product and services capabilities. We also had good performance in our Supply Chain software. Supply Chain Order Management enables the shift to more flexible and scalable digital channels, which is a great value prop to our clients during the pandemic. Looking at the profit for this segment, we had strong profit and margin performance driven primarily by Red Hat contribution. Turning to Global Business Services, revenue declined 6%, consistent with last quarter. As you'll recall, prior to the pandemic, GBS was growing revenue and signings. Since March, our revenue has reflected the economic environment and a change in client priorities leading to project delays, and less demand for more discretionary offerings. But as we pivot our offerings and delivery to address these client needs, GBS posted double-digit signings growth in the third quarter, and returned its backlog to growth. This was driven by cloud strategy, application development and modernization and offerings that use data and AI to transform workflows. As I mentioned earlier, our GBS cloud signings were up over 25%.We signed a number of large transformational contracts with a total value greater than $100 million, which will yield revenue over time. Our small deal performance generally followed the pandemic curve by geography, but returned to growth overall for the quarter. With the expertise and process knowledge gained through our application management incumbency, clients trust us to guide them through architectural decisions and facilitate their transformations with a particular expertise in application modernization at scale across all on-prem, private, and public cloud environments. GBS drives adoption of IBM's hybrid cloud platform and is a gateway to bring the wider set of IBM capabilities to enable a client's digital journey. For example, about one-third of Cloud Pak revenue results from GBS engagements and, this quarter, we added another 60 Red Hat client engagements with such clients as Delta Airlines, which Arvind mentioned earlier, but also Royal Bank of Canada, IT Ergo, Florida Power and Light and Telefonica Espana. As our clients are transforming, we are also investing in our GBS business to position for growth in the future. We are continuing to invest in skills, resources, offerings and ecosystems. We have implemented a virtual sales engagement model and are delivering nearly all of our more than 1,500 active paid Garage engagements virtually. And, we are taking the learnings from our initial shift to remote delivery to establish a new delivery model. Dynamic Delivery integrates technical foundations with virtualized methods and practices, enhanced with AI and automation to drive productivity, pace and quality. As we apply the Dynamic Delivery principles across our client base, in the third quarter we delivered more than 90% of our services remotely, while maintaining stable quality and increasing Net Promoter Score. Looking at the profit dynamics, with our focus on high value offerings, productivity and strong operational discipline, we expanded GBS gross margin by 190 basis points. In Global Technology Services, revenue was down 4%, fairly consistent with last quarter. Infrastructure Services continues to experience lower client-based business volumes in the more economically sensitive industries and TSS performance reflects hardware product cycles and continuing volume impacts due to the pandemic. But many clients are taking a longer-term view and are looking to modernize their infrastructure to create agility and operational efficiency. They turn to GTS' Managed Infrastructure Services business for its deep expertise in managing mission-critical infrastructures and its next-generation service delivery capabilities infused with AI and automation. Coca-Cola European Partners is a great example. We recently signed a multi-year agreement to accelerate their modernization journey. We'll help them to reduce operational expenses, increase IT resiliency and leverage AI to bring enhanced insights and deliver greater service to their customers. GTS' signings were down 1% this quarter, but up 12% year to date with 19 deals over $100 million, including eight this quarter. In addition to new work, clients continue to make long-term commitments with significant contract renewals as we deliver new value. This has resulted in the backlog year-to-year trajectory improving by approximately two points from the beginning of the year. Turning to GTS profit, gross margin declined by roughly 80 basis points. This was driven by the investments we are making in public cloud and the volume impacts which come at a high margin. Turning to Systems, revenue was down 16%, driven primarily by product cycle dynamics. IBM Z revenue was down 20%. We launched the z15 toward the end of the third quarter last year. We've had widespread adoption of both z15 and LinuxONE across many industries and countries in support of clients' hybrid cloud journeys. IBM Z is seeing record-setting volumes on Linux as clients leverage Red Hat OpenShift, Ansible and our cloud native dev ops offerings. At the same time, this pandemic has impacted our historical IBM Z cycle dynamics, which is playing out differently by industry. This platform has proved invaluable to our clients in areas like banking and financial markets, helping them rapidly and remotely scale up capacity and respond to unprecedented market volatility. As a result, these clients accelerated their adoption of z15 within the cycle. That said, in many other industries, clients remain focused on cash preservation during this pandemic. This dichotomy in client buying behaviors impacted our performance in the third quarter and will lengthen the adoption curve of this z15 cycle. But by the end of this cycle, we have an opportunity to be fairly consistent with prior cycles. I'll remind you, in the fourth quarter, we'll be wrapping on very strong performance from last year when we were up 63%. These cycle dynamics impacted our storage revenue as well with performance driven by declines in high-end storage. Now, as always, before the Q&A, I'll bring it back up to the IBM level. We are seeing tremendous opportunity to help our clients become digital businesses. Our technology-centric hybrid cloud platform, deep industry expertise and growing ecosystem are enabling us to accelerate these transformations. The value we provide clients is evident this quarter in our cloud revenue growth, in our continued momentum in Red Hat, and in our strong GBS signings driven by cloud and application modernization offerings. And now we are accelerating IBM's hybrid cloud platform strategy with increased focus and investments to drive future growth. We are taking structural actions to simplify and streamline our business and as we discussed earlier this month, we expect a fourth quarter charge to our operating results of about $2.3 billion. The savings from these actions will be reinvested in areas like hybrid cloud, data and AI, security, and emerging technologies. With our focused hybrid cloud platform strategy and the increased investments starting now, we expect to drive sustainable mid-single-digit growth after the separation of NewCo is complete. In the near-term, the rate and pace of recovery remains uncertain and as a consequence, we have not seen a fundamental shift in overall demand levels. Given this uncertainty, and consistent with our direction for most of this year, we are not going to provide guidance. But I will remind you, from an historical perspective, the fourth quarter seasonally is our strongest quarter in terms of revenue and operating earnings per share due to our high value software and hardware transactions. Looking at our year-to-year dynamics at the end of 2020, we are wrapping on a strong fourth quarter of 2019, when we had a very strong software performance, our first full quarter of z15 availability and our first full quarter of Red Hat contribution. So, going into this fourth quarter, as always, we have a lot of work to do. It's our largest transactional quarter, we'll be focusing our investments in hybrid cloud and AI and of course we're starting the detailed work to separate our Managed Infrastructure Services business. We are confident in the focus and direction of our business and what it means for our future. Arvind, let me turn it back over to you. Yes, Tien-tsin, this is Jim. I'll take that one. Let's talk a little bit about the quarter in what we just finished with regards to services signings. We're pretty pleased given the overall macroeconomic environment and the rate and pace and the continued uncertainty. The teams executed very well, $9.5 billion of signings, up 5%. We got a $108 billion backlog right now that's flat at actual rates, down 1% at constant currency. And to your point, we saw actually very good progress in large transformational deals. I think 11 in the quarter in excess of $100 million and eight of those in our GTS Manage Infrastructure Services business which saw a very strong renewal rate that talks to the value of innovation that they bring to our client set overall and that has led to year-to-date, I think we said in the prepared remarks, GTS up 12% signings and I'll remind you, that was off of a third quarter last year while we grew 20%. So we are pretty pleased there and that's led to a two point backlog improvement in our GTS business since January. But what we really have seen a marked inflection of some signs of demand change is in GBS. And you know while the revenue kind of played out consistent with 2Q, our signings were up double-digits, I think it was our third largest signings quarter almost in history and our both large and small deals overall and that was really a testament to our GBS capability around application modernization and being our clients' provider of choice for digital transformation and journey to cloud. So, we feel pretty good about that. It's good early trends. We got a very nice pipeline of transformational deals here in the fourth quarter and again, given our announcement ten days ago, we are spending a lot of time with our clients to make sure we minimize disruption, ensure stability and provide that client value going forward. Toni, this is Jim. Thanks for the question, multi-part. But let me take the first piece around, color around fourth quarter and then, Arvind can handle the capital allocation discussion around the strategy and I have to see if I can handle some of the numbers overall. But first, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, and you indicated the rate and pace of the recovery we still see is uncertain. And there is no real fundamental change in client buying priorities around cash preservation, around operational stability and consistent with prior quarters, that has led us to not give guidance. But, let me give you some color. First, we talked about at the onsite of COVID-19 that this has only accelerated our clients' digital transformation and journey to the cloud and you see that playing out in our results over the last few quarters with continued very good momentum in our cloud business and in our Red Hat business. And when we look at fourth quarter, we see very healthy pipelines in hybrid cloud, AI solutions, App modernization, Cloud Transformation Services within GBS, Red Hat actual backlog growth is accelerating, up 23% at $4.7 billion and we see pretty healthy pipelines in our cloud and data platform and in our Cognitive Apps business led by Cloud Paks and Security. The two things that we called out though in our prepared remarks that we talked about the last few quarters and those are headwinds. And first in particular around TPP, our clients committed to that platform. We had a very strong 2019 and given the environment and the focus on cash preservation, we don't see that coming back in the fourth quarter and it's going to be pretty similar to the first half. And the second is our mainframe cycle coming off with a significant portion of the growth last year up 63%. So when you look at skew overall, in the fourth quarter, 3Q to 4Q, yes, I mean, there will be no reason not to expect a normal skew with regards to revenue. Some slight improvement in our software portfolio offset by TPP and we'll wrap on the hardware piece. Now in terms of EPS, you saw the very strong fundamentals in third quarter coming off of strong 2Q. Operating gross margins up 160 basis points, operating pretax margin up 140 basis points. We feel very confident in the strength of our balance sheet, our cash and liquidity position to make sure that we can continue to invest in our business. We are starting that immediately here in fourth quarter around technology, around innovation, around skills, around capabilities, and you'll see that play out in addition to the $2.3 billion structural charge. So, when you look at EPS, you all know the numbers, as well as I do. Over the last x number of years, our 3Q to 4Q pre the $2.3 billion charge has been a nice growth of about 50 \u2013 mid-50s. We should do maybe a little bit better than that, but I don't think anything substantial about that. So, we see pretty similar dynamics. Arvind, over to you. Yes. So, Wamsi, thank you very much for the question overall. If you look at the structural actions we took as we entered 2020, remember we talked a lot about this in January, pre-COVID on how we were going to reposition our businesses as we move forward. You see that actually playing out in our results. I mean, our margins in the second quarter were up roughly 150 basis points at gross margin level, and in third quarter we just came off margins that are up 160 basis points at the gross level and operating margins that are up 140 basis points at the pretax level. So, I think you are seeing that productivity and the fundamental change and the way we are actually driving and running the business now adapting given the onset of COVID-19 and the implications to the economic environment. If you take a look at the fourth quarter actions overall, we talked about ten days ago the strategic action around separating out and creating two market-leading companies and creating an independent publicly traded company around our Managed Infrastructure Services business, that was going to be about a $2.3 billion charge. And if you remember what I said at the time and you can kind of think of this is in one-third buckets. The first is about a third of that is going to go to help improve the EBITDA growth profile in our NewCo business to be on a trajectory to achieve post separation of double-digit EBITDA growth profile. The second bucket or second third of that was, in any business when you separate out, you are going to create stranded cost and inefficiency and we are committed to addressing that in 2021 with this charge. And then the third piece is, we are making significant investments to capitalize on the $1 trillion hybrid cloud market opportunity and the third bucket is going to be used for additional fin flex. That is going to be centered around technology, innovation, people, skills, capability, ecosystems and also as Arvind just answered, around inorganic place overall. So, I'll take that one and then Arvind, do you want to take the second one? Okay, Keith. Actually, Arvind, if you don't mind, let me take both. As I think part of the first question, you've already answered from a strategic capital allocation perspective on what we want to do with regards to our investment profile both organically and inorganically. But Keith, the heart of your question gets to a mathematical equation. And I think, one, first, you got to recognize that there is always been seasonality in our free cash flow albeit we delivered $4.8 billion year-to-date in free cash flow overall, as you all know quite well, well over 50% of our free cash flow in this business comes in the fourth quarter. That, coupled with, we talked about two quarters ago at the onset of COVID-19 how the business model composition of IBM with its geographic diversification, its industry composition, its client segmentation, be a more large enterprise focus and its annuity content of both high value software, high value hardware platform and high value services piece provides a natural hedge in this environment the stability around revenue, profit and cash. Now, yes, over the last couple of years we've been driving around $12 billion of free cash flow in light of the economic challenges due to COVID-19, that number just trajectory-wise will be less this year. We'll see how fourth quarter plays out. But we are very confident in our portfolio, in fact even more confident given the decision that Arvind and the entire IBM team and our Board made on October 8th around repositioning two market-leading companies. One within IBM and an accelerated growth profile with an already very strong EBITDA margin business that is going to generate significant cash and then two, a lead in the market-leading infrastructure services business that is 2x the next competitor and in that business as you all understand quite well, is a scale economics business. So, from that aspect, I think when you look at our fin flex, our fin flex only gets better and with our disciplined financial capital allocation policy that this company operates on, we feel very comfortable that we got ample free cash flow to invest in our business organically and inorganically to delever and hit those targeted leverage ratios and also to maintain our return to shareholder program with a secure dividend and sustainable dividend growth policy overall. So that's the first question. Second question, when you look at GBS, as I talked about, we did see signs of demand improvement here in the third quarter and if you remember 90 days ago, we talked about the first half of second quarter and the second half of second quarter in the month of June and we saw some nice growth in June. While that continued into the third quarter where double-digit signings growth overall and by the way, Keith, that was pretty pervasive. That was good growth in consulting, but it was led by large transformational deals around application services in this environment to capitalize on our clients' journey to cloud. That then drag listed our global process services where clients are now digitally reinventing themselves in how they run their companies around intelligent workflows. So we are seeing that demand inflection move now. To your question, that revenue is more long-term as we play out. But when we look at our current backlog and our current backlog runout for our GBS business, in 2021, we see GBS getting back to pre-COVID growth rates by mid-year and a big chunk of that is improvement across all the three sub-segments. Yes, Jim. This is Jim. Let me take that and then I could wrap it up with Arvind overall. As you know quite well, our disciplined capital allocation process first and foremost focuses on how we reinvest back in our business both organically and inorganically and we are focused now with the strategic move that we announced. We laid the foundation we talked on October 8th. We laid that foundation over the last couple of years, instantiated in the Red Had acquisition which was a bold move. We have been building and accelerating that growth. Now we want to capitalize on that $1 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity. Now with that said, just given our investor mix, outside of allocating capital and investment to our own business, when we have excess cash, we are going to return that back to shareholders. That priority right now is our secure dividend and sustainable growth policy and as we get back to our targeted leverage ratios, at that point in time we'll reevaluate share repurchase. But there is no need talking about that right now."

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thanks Patricia. I'm pleased to be speaking with you again just a week and a half after our strategic update on October 8th. Today, we'll focus on our third quarter performance, which you'll see is unchanged from the preliminary results we announced. But I want to start with a summary of our strategic discussion. We are redefining our future as a hybrid cloud platform and AI company. Over the last few years, we have built a solid foundation for hybrid cloud. With the acceleration of the Red Hat platform adoption and the changes to clients' needs for application versus infrastructure services we are separating our Managed Infrastructure Services into a new publicly traded company. The result is two market leaders with focused strategies and missions and improved growth trajectories. IBM is the number one hybrid cloud platform and AI company. NewCo will become the number one Managed Infrastructure Services company. As separate businesses, each can capitalize on their respective missions. Both will have more agility to focus on their operating and financial models. Both will have greater freedom to partner with others, and both will align their investments and capital structure to their strategic focus areas. All of this will create value for clients and for you, the investors with an improved financial profile of both companies. Since the announcement, we have had a comprehensive outreach to our clients. In fact, we have spoken to hundreds of our top clients and I have personally spoken to dozens. The vast majority understand the strategy and are excited about what it means for them, whether they'll be predominantly future IBM clients, or NewCo clients. Our partners have also had a positive response, as they see this as an opportunity to further strengthen our go-to-market initiatives in the hybrid cloud, data and AI spaces. For IBM, as we look forward, the case for hybrid cloud is clear. Clients see two-and-a-half times more value in a hybrid cloud approach versus a public-only. It is a tremendous opportunity valued at a trillion dollars with most of the enterprise opportunity ahead of us. Our approach is platform-centric. It is differentiated by Red Hat OpenShift, which is our market-leading open platform, a vast software portfolio modernized to run cloud-native and our GBS expertise that drives platform adoption and meets clients \u201cwhere they are\u201d on their cloud journeys. Over the coming months, we'll further advance our strategy by taking actions to simplify and optimize our model, increase investments in key areas and fostering much more of a growth mindset. All of this will contribute to accelerated growth for our company in the future and we expect to deliver sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth upon completion of the separation of NewCo. Let me shift to some of the recent progress we have made against our hybrid cloud platform strategy from the perspective of our clients, our ecosystem and innovations we are bringing to market. We have great recent examples of clients making large-scale architectural commitments to our hybrid cloud platform. Schlumberger is using our platform to make their E&P environment accessible across any infrastructure that their global clients use, on-premise, private and public clouds. They'll enable the broader energy community to leverage data analytics and AI to unleash the power of digital innovation in the oil and gas industry. We are also extending our relationship with Delta to transform their talent and modernize their IT environment using Red Hat, Cloud Paks, and leveraging GBS' expertise. They'll operate with greater speed and realize longer- term business benefits. We're continuing to expand our ecosystem. Last week I talked about how we have added hundreds of partners to drive workloads to our platform, including best-of-breed GSIs and ISVs. As an example, Ernst & Young is now leveraging our open hybrid cloud platform and AI solutions to help clients transform their businesses. Our teams are also providing joint consulting capabilities to drive business outcomes for clients. Late last week, we announced the expansion of our partnership with ServiceNow to bring the power of Watson AIOps to their market leading Now Platform. We are also bringing new innovations to market. I'll highlight just two areas, Red Hat and Quantum. Red Hat extended its open hybrid cloud portfolio with several new technology introductions, including OpenShift Virtualization, which enables clients to migrate and run their virtual machines natively within Red Hat OpenShift and Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, which delivers the industry's most robust multi-cluster, policy-based compliance and application management system. These capabilities are furthering our clients' abilities to \"build once, deploy anywhere\" with a hybrid cloud architecture. In Quantum, we announced our roadmap to reach 1,000-plus qubits by 2023. The roadmap aims to take today's noisy, small-scale devices towards the million-plus qubit devices of the future. This kind of progress is essential to help industry and research organizations tackle important real-world problems that even today's most powerful classical computers cannot tackle. And in making our roadmap public, we are committing to meet a series of aggressive benchmarks that will help our company maintain its leadership in quantum computing and place our clients on the path to groundbreaking achievements. So we have made good progress with clients, our ecosystem, and innovation. Regarding today's environment, clients continue to balance short-term challenges and opportunities for transformation. In the short-term they are focused on operational stability and cash preservation. We see this especially in our larger software license transactions and delays in some services projects. But more of my conversations with CEOs are around how they become digital businesses. How do they tap into open source innovation? How can they securely deploy and manage their data and applications across various clouds? That's what we call hybrid cloud. We see this in the continued momentum in Red Hat and in the large client engagements that enables a journey to cloud, leveraging both OpenShift and application modernization. Now I'll turn it over to Jim Kavanaugh, who is going to take you through the results, and then we'll come back at the end for Q&A. Thanks Jim. I am going to add just one final thought before the Q&A. We are managing for the long-term. We are making strategic decisions, taking actions and increasing investments today to better position our business and accelerate our top-line growth, on a sustainable basis. Patricia, let's go to the Q&A. All right. So first, thanks for the question, Matt. So, a few comments on \u2013 because you ask about portfolio areas, you also ask about clients and you also ask about geographies. And it all varies. But we are seeing first from large client deals, as well as services projects. Let me just reiterate, but add a little bit of color to what Jim and I said in our prepared remarks. While we are seeing very healthy growth in some parts of both software and systems, it's kind of \u2013 it's frantic, but we are also seeing people pause. Now maybe they are pausing because of their industry or because of geography or because they are into a cash conservation mode, we think it's a pause. We don't believe it's a decline forever. We do believe that some of those deals come back and we tend to see that. We saw that from the first to the second, second to the third quarter et cetera. So, that's a one part. Now, we have also talked about that there is about a 70% of the industries that we are in, we are not seeing any pause as we see clients there are healthy. We see that their businesses are healthy. About 30% and that should not be a surprise to anybody in this call, we do tend to see some temporary softness and maybe think about brick and mortar retail, you think about airlines, you think about hospitality, I think it's not a surprise that some of those. Now, we also tend to be with larger clients. So we don't believe that they have a sustainability issue by and large. It will tend to come back. So that's out of the flavor under it. But then as I begin to look forward, Matt, because you are asking that question also, it's really hard to predict the fourth quarter. That's why Jim and I are pausing on giving guidance here. However when we look at our people interested in these parts of the software portfolio, whether it's supply chain and security as Jim mentioned, whether it's cloud and data platform which is inclusive both of Red Hat and our cloud packs and all the technologies they find essential, we find that those will come back. We find our transaction processing platform or TPP yet somewhat aligned to the mainframe capacity increases as those go through you tend to see, I'll call it an alignment. It's not necessarily identical but there is some alignment therein. And then, let's not forget that as a Global Business Services and other SIs do transformation projects, they also tend to pull through software more in cloud and data platform there in other areas. So, I'll sort of give you that color sort of across the client set, across the industries and across different parts of the portfolio, Matt. Thanks, Jim. And Toni, thank you for asking the capital allocation question. A really important piece of our growth strategy going forward. So a couple of points there for context; one, when we acquired and closed on Red Hat, we did commit to pausing share repurchase until we have deleveraged and gotten back to our target ratios of debt-to-EBITDA. So we are on track to do that. We fully intend to do that and we had said that we will get there by 2022. So that's part one. And so some of the cash you see in the balance sheet will be used towards that purpose because you said you are not paying down that, but you'll see us begin to pay that down to get towards those ratios, part one. Part two, we are committed to a stable and growing dividend. Our dividend to our investors given that how much they depend upon that and how much you have heard about that and feedback, we intend to keep a stable and growing dividend. That means, everything else is up for what is prudent for managing for the long-term. And so, when we talk about increased investments, and on October 8th I was clear, we are going to both increase expenses organically in order to be able to grow in both software and in GBS, but we are also going to be quite acquisitive in the areas that we have called out. We will be acquisitive in GBS and we will also be acquisitive in the software areas around hybrid cloud, data AI, security and in emerging technologies such as Quantum. So, when you see us do that, I think we are going to be doing exactly what you are asking. We will be allocating more cash to growth going forward. I think the simple answer to that is, yes, with no qualifications therein. Yes. So, when you look at the different segments that we are in, Wamsi, so this is straightaway in the four areas that we had outlined. Number one, we are going to be increasing investments in GBS in order to get more skills in the areas that we are seeing demand. Second, we are going to be increasing investments in our ecosystem and ecosystems that are large partners, we just announced ServiceNow last week, but we announced Adobe a couple of months before that. You've seen us with Salesforce, you've seen us with others. So we are going to be increasing our investments in how we work with those. But there are also hundreds of ISVs, not just the very large ones, it's one we are also working to get them on our hybrid cloud platform, on our cloud properties and so how do we invest in that in order to drive growth down the road is a second piece. I'll put that in the ecosystem bucket. Third, we are going to be increasing investments in our core software areas in terms of the hybrid cloud platform itself and you saw that in some of my prepared remarks on the innovations we are driving into the Red Hat technologies, but in addition to that in terms of data and AI, in security and others, we are going to drive innovation in there. And as you put all those areas together, let's not also forget, NewCo is also going to be seeing increased investments around automation, around infrastructure modernization against looking the different cloud partners. So when you think of those four buckets, it now goes pretty much across all of IBM's segments, Wamsi, if you think about it, because we wanted to be, I'll call it balance, it's not identical growth, but we want all of the segments to be contributing to growth and so we got to be driving in terms of organic R&D, in terms of working with certain areas where there is a lot of demand. So you got to get skills in there and of course, as we add M&A, that's not quite directly from these buckets of money, but the M&A will also add to added expenses eventually while the moment you complete an acquisition as expense in these different segments. Thanks, Katy. And you got it correct. It is a critical part of us getting towards a mid-single-digit growth target. So, that is essential. So, as we begin to go under it and you look at it for the last few months, I would tell you that some of it is indeed maximally the wrong word, but I think as there is two elements in there. People are pausing certain large software license transactions and that is perhaps the macro environment and then there is the TPP piece which is inside of the software segment which is driven more as I've said before in terms of the alignment to the mainframe capacity that's in the ground. So we saw very good growth in the fourth quarter or last year we saw that tied to that and as you begin to see that slowdown in the third quarter of this year, we do expect to \u2013 I think see that continue for some time. But within that, when I look at our Cognitive Applications and we look at cloud and data platform, we do see healthy growth there, but I expect to see continue. As we invest more into that, and as we invest more into Red Hat, I would expect that as we get through the next year, we are going to see that that should be able to more than offset anything that happens in TPP. And just to give a sense of that, Katy, when you begin to look at Red Hat by itself, and we see the growth there in the mid-to-high teens, and we expect that that should be able to continue and accelerate, then that in turn will give added growth to the whole portfolio more than enough to offset any weakness in TPP and then as you are increasing our investment in our ecosystem, as well as in internal R&D as well as in acquisitions, while I'll acknowledge that those do take multiple quarters to play out. I wish it was quicker, but it is multiple quarters, but I would fully expect it at the same time as we complete the spin, we should be able to see those growth return in those parts of the portfolio and you got to fence of how we'll do it across those various elements. Yes, great question, Amit. So, as you can imagine, this is something in which I think the only word I can use is, we are obsessive about this topic. We had our lists out. We knew exactly of what clients might be concerned about and I wouldn't say that we are 100% perfect, but I think we feel very, very good that we were correct in our estimations of the level of concerns. To you give you a sense, we sort of internally, this is not something that we also tell the client, but based on the reaction, I mentioned that we already spoken to hundreds. So you can think that but now that we are ten days in, we have already spoken to at least between two and three hundred of the top clients where there is a strong intersection or where there is a very heavy SPINCO revenue base or deals that could be on the table. And from there, we have gotten back over 80% our corridor in the great to good to not really concerned. And I'll come back and give some color on why we believe that's true. Then there are some \u2013 we'll do enough on both sides that they do have some concerns. Both of those concerns are around, who is team that will be providing service. Who is the person whose going to be on the ground and we should be very clear that SPINCO is going to head out on day one with $19, the same management team on the ground who runs it from the client up is going to be team that does it. Yes, it's a corporate structure that we've put in place, but that's not the team on the ground, just to be clear. They have very high satisfaction with the majority of their clients and that is because they bring both service excellence in terms of the service and the upturn that they provide, but also they bring very deep technical skills which is kind of gives them permission and the trust to play. So, when I put all of that together, I think that there is a couple of dozen clients where we just have to make sure that we can tell them who is the team there is going to be servicing them and as they begin to get comfort on that, I can see the level of anxiety reduce. But as I said, over 80%, they understood what was happening and also many clients the majority on one or the other of naturally for them there is going to be less of a concern. Now, to your point on why would they complete the deals. Look most of the larger deals are to our clients' benefit. We don't do something unless they are going to get a business benefit from that and in this environment if you want to go pause that for three or six months, you are going to defer your benefit for three to six months. So, I think what drives things and luckily they have a month to sort of on both side, both our team as they find to sort of understand each other then there is still enough time in the quarter to go get those deals done. So, the quarter will tell us whether we are right or not. But based on everything I can see, I am confident that actually we'll be able to see most of the deals progress to a satisfactory conclusion. Hi, David. Look, the market is a $500 billion market from what we can see, from what IDC shows us, as well as what many other third-party consultants has told us. A couple of things in there. Within that, if I find where is our portfolio and our clients today, is probably more heavily weighted and about 60% of that total as opposed to all of it. And we think that the ability to form many more partnerships as standalone is going to allow IX to much more fully participate in the complete market. Two, we have waited pretty consistently that we are going to start them off with a investment-grade balance sheet. That should allow them to also make targeted acquisitions as appropriate. We can't speak for that and we up to the management team post spin. But that is a place we are always in a market where it's a scale game. That's definitely a way that you can both grow and gain market share. And so, two, three, Jim mentioned that a third of the restructuring charge is for also improving the EBITDA profile of the spin company. That is going to allow them to also invest in new offerings in areas such as cloud modernization, as well as added offerings in aspects of compliance and security and resilience and also in much more automation which is going to allow them to deliver even higher service delivery excellence to their clients. So when I look across all those, the opportunity is certainly there. And freeing them up to deals which we might not do, because the margin maybe dilutive to us, but it's going to be accretive towards the new company, two possibly M&A down the road, but that's not for some time. And three, in terms of leveraging new offerings and partnerships with other companies who might be doing it, but maybe not as wholeheartedly as they would do it with an independent company. Okay. Thanks, Jim. Look, just to reiterate, we have talked about growth. We have talked about a maniacal obsession on hybrid cloud and AI as the engines of growth for the company. But let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the discussion. We are certain on our direction even in these uncertain times. And we are laser focused on helping our clients with their digital transformation leveraging our hybrid cloud technology platform, our incumbency, and our expertise. And the actions we are taking starting now in the fourth quarter will enhance our focus and accelerate our future growth and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I want to welcome you to IBM\u2019s Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Presentation. I am here with Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll post today\u2019s prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the Company\u2019s SEC filings. Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue and signings growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, we\u2019ll focus on constant currency growth adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud and our geographic performance. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. Finally, consistent with our last few quarters, IBM\u2019s revenue, profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. These adjustments and charges are primarily non-cash. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Hello, everyone. I am pleased to be speaking with you again. In April\u2019s call, I talked about the impact of the global public health crisis and I told you about the important work we are carrying out to help the shifting needs of our clients. I also told you about the confidence I have in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud, as well as data and AI, all of this continues. Today there are two topics I\u2019d like to cover. First, I want to tell you about what we\u2019re seeing in the market and then, I want to discuss our priorities and actions we have taken to move them forward. From a market perspective, while the current environment poses certain short-term challenges, it also presents long-term opportunities that IBM will seize, as our clients accelerate their shift to hybrid cloud and AI. The essential work that we do in terms of running our clients\u2019 mission-critical processes continues. More profoundly, we see that the digital transformation of businesses is accelerating. Our second quarter results demonstrate this, with an increase of over ten points in our cloud revenue growth over last quarter. The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks. They want to infuse AI into their workflows and secure their IT infrastructure to fend off growing cybersecurity threats. As a result, we are seeing an increased opportunity for large, transformational projects. These are projects where IBM has a unique value proposition. But they are also projects that take time to shape and therefore to close. At the same time, we are feeling the impact of austerity measures that businesses have put in place to preserve cash and capital. Our software and services results reflect this reality. Jim will take you through this in more detail. Taken altogether, this is the backdrop of our results for this quarter. They reflect the immediate challenges and long-term opportunities of this environment. Now, let me move on and discuss my priorities moving forward. As I touched upon in our last call, IBM is focused on helping our clients in the two major transformational journeys they are on: hybrid cloud as well as data and AI. Hybrid cloud is the dominant force driving change in our industry, but it\u2019s far from universal adoption. Only 20% of the workloads have moved to the cloud. The other 80% are mission-critical workloads that are far more difficult to move. There is a massive opportunity in front of us to capture these workloads. When I say hybrid cloud, I am talking about an interoperable IT environment across on-premise, private, and publicly operated cloud environments, in most cases from multiple vendors. Why do we believe this is the future, rather than a pitstop along the way? Clients find that choosing a hybrid cloud approach is two-and-a-half times more valuable than relying on public cloud alone. This considers factors such as innovation, development time and portfolio optimization. Let me spend a minute to describe our hybrid cloud platform. It starts with Linux, which is the de facto operating system standard. We have a tremendous advantage with Red Hat Linux, which is the market share leader. Linux, along with Containers and Kubernetes, provides the architectural foundation of our platform, and OpenShift is our core product that captures all this and more. IBM has a vast software and middleware portfolio, which has now been containerized and runs on OpenShift and Red Hat Linux. The family of Cloud Paks we introduced in the second half of last year allows our middleware to run in a cloud-native environment and bridge our clients from the past to the future. This means clients can now deploy our software anywhere OpenShift runs. It is infrastructure agnostic, across not just public and private clouds, but also our mainframes and power system platforms. OpenShift is also what makes it possible to develop and consume software in a new way. It\u2019s what enables DevSecOps and all the subsequent boosts in productivity, security, and speed of deployment. Our hybrid cloud platform also includes a set of advanced technologies, such as Watson, analytics, encryption, IoT and many others. What gives our hybrid cloud platform the fuel it needs to accelerate adoption and become pervasive is the large ecosystem of partners we are building. We have gone to great lengths to forge a global coalition of best of breed ISVs. This includes recent additions like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, Box and Slack. All are using our hybrid cloud platform to help clients modernize mission-critical workloads. We have done the same with major systems integrators Ernst & Young, Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems, all are examples that are helping expand the reach of IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud platform. Finally, you\u2019ll recall that nearly half of the hybrid cloud opportunity lies in services. An important part of our platform\u2019s value lies in the expertise we provide to help clients on their journey, whether that\u2019s modernizing apps, building cloud-native apps, migrating to the cloud or managing these applications on the public and private cloud infrastructures. We are currently helping hundreds of major clients on these journeys. I believe that our strategic vision is taking hold in the marketplace. I mentioned the acceleration in our cloud growth this quarter to over 30%. This hybrid cloud platform generated over $23 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. I just described the importance of Red Hat Linux and OpenShift to our platform, and Red Hat continued its momentum in the quarter, with the combination of IBM and Red Hat driving strong revenue and bookings growth. Across the board, we are seeing greater demand for Red Hat products. Clients are eager to tap into open source innovation. They want the freedom to securely deploy, run and manage their data and applications on the cloud of their choice and retaining that choice is critical. Clients such as Bharti Airtel, American Express, Vodafone, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Banco Sabadell, and CaixaBank all see the value in a hybrid cloud architecture built by IBM and Red Hat. As part of our hybrid cloud strategy, a key focus is to help clients tackle complex and highly regulated workloads. Last year, we launched the financial services-ready public cloud with Bank of America and we recently created a new program for ISVs and SaaS, Software-as-a-Service, providers. I am happy to share that we now have 30 ISVs signed up. This happened with great speed, and I am confident that more will join soon. So, let me pause for a moment and remind you of the three priorities I shared with IBMers on my first day as CEO: One, help our clients on their journey to cloud and AI. Two, win the architectural battles in cloud with Red Hat. Three, continually delight our clients. These priorities remain the same, and you can see how we have made progress in all of them. At the same time, we have continued to deliver a series of new innovations in the last quarter. We launched our new edge and telco network cloud solutions built on Red Hat OpenStack and Red Hat OpenShift that enables clients to run workloads anywhere, from a data center, to multiple clouds, to the edge. We also launched our AI for IT offering to give every CIO the ability to automate their IT infrastructure that immediately reduces cost and becomes more resilient. AI for IT runs across any cloud and works in collaboration with an ecosystem of partners that includes Slack and Box. On quantum computing, we added an additional four systems, which expands our fleet to 22 quantum computing systems. That includes eight systems that have demonstrated a quantum volume of 32, a yardstick IBM has proposed to measure the relative power and usefulness of quantum computers. I\u2019ve talked previously about the importance of both organic and inorganic investment to drive innovation. We recently announced two acquisitions that will enhance our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. In June, we acquired Spanugo to boost our compliance and cybersecurity capabilities for the hybrid cloud. And, in early July, we agreed to acquire WDG Automation that advances AI-infused automation capabilities into our Cloud Paks. Needless to say, this is a unique and challenging time for our clients. To continue to be their most trusted partner, we are spending a lot of time and energy to drastically simplify how our teams go to market. We are doing a lot of work on the back-end to bring our portfolio together in a more cohesive fashion, so our teams can come with simpler and more relevant proposals. We are also focused on changing our culture and operating model, so we can make decisions more quickly and make our interactions with clients a lot more experiential. Jim will take you through a few of our more recent actions. Moving forward, we will continue to take actions that improve our operating model and accelerate our strategic priorities so that we can emerge stronger. Before turning to Jim, let me end by saying a few words on our commitment to corporate social responsibility. This has always been important to IBM. But, as you know with the current events in the United States, there has been a renewed focus to do more. As IBM\u2019s CEO, I am fully committed to ensuring that IBM will continue to lead in this area. But this is also about skills and creating opportunity. Since 2011, IBM has helped to develop and expand a new public-education model called PTECH. P-TECH provides high school students from underserved backgrounds with the skills and credentials they need for competitive jobs in STEM. To that end, we recently made a commitment to hire 1,000 interns who come from P-TECH. To put this in context, we have between 5,000 and 10,000 interns at IBM each year. So this represents more than ten percent of our intern base. I am always happy to expand later on this and other topics relating to our ESG efforts. Now, back to the quarter and the business, Jim is going to take you through our results. Jim, over to you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. During our first quarter earnings call, I talked about how we are prepared for a wide range of outcomes given the economic uncertainty. Our second quarter results were within that range. We delivered $18.1 billion of revenue, expanded gross margin, reported operating earnings per share of $2.18 and continued to generate solid free cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have ample liquidity. The external dynamics we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with varied impacts by region and industry. As we discussed in April, we are not immune to the macroeconomic environment. But our client and our portfolio mix provide some stability in our revenue, profit, and free cash flow. We saw that again this quarter. Let me remind you of how our business mix provides this stability. From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic. Though as you would expect, we saw more weakness from smaller enterprises this quarter. About 70% of our revenue comes from industries that run the world\u2019s most critical processes and those industries have been less impacted by the current economic and health crisis. We saw that in our results again this quarter, and in fact grew revenue in financial markets, government and education. From a geographic perspective, we have a global footprint of more than 170 countries. This provides a bit of a natural hedge, as we continue to see markets experience different impacts from the pandemic over time. And then finally, when you look at our portfolio, about 60% of our revenue comes from recurring revenue streams. While we\u2019ve adapted quickly to conduct business virtually around the world, as expected, we did have disruptions in transactional performance and volume reductions. Many clients continued to delay projects, defer purchases, and favor OpEx over CapEx spending in this environment. This pause in large purchases and discretionary spending was most evident in our perpetual software licenses and project-oriented services. While clients remain focused on near-term priorities, running mission-critical processes, operational stability, and cash preservation, as Arvind mentioned, the last few months also highlighted the need for clients to accelerate their digital transformations, leveraging hybrid cloud and AI. Across IBM, our cloud revenue grew 34%, which is up from the 23% growth in the first quarter. IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud platform generated more than $23 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. With Red Hat, we are positioned to win the hybrid cloud architectural battle, and have developed the most secure, open hybrid cloud platform, underpinned by OpenShift. We\u2019ve brought Red Hat and IBM technology together in our modernized Cloud Pak software solutions, providing the leading hybrid cloud platform. We now have over 2,400 clients using our container solutions and nearly 600 IBM Services clients utilizing Red Hat technology. Red Hat delivered strong results in the period with normalized revenue growth of 18%, driven by the synergistic effect of IBM and Red Hat. Last August, we talked about how Red Hat would benefit from IBM\u2019s incumbency in large accounts and leverage our global reach to expand into new markets. We\u2019re seeing that where IBM and Red Hat come together, clients are making larger scale architectural commitments and longer-term and more strategic purchases. This quarter we had a significant increase in the number of Red Hat large deals and expanded Red Hat\u2019s presence in underpenetrated focus markets. In the second quarter we took additional steps to better position IBM in this environment and emerge stronger. We announced new offerings including AI for IT and 5G edge and we recently added key capabilities in RPA and cloud security through two acquisitions. We are also working to fundamentally shift our operating model. We are simplifying the geographic dimension of our go-to-market by consolidating our operations and moving to a streamlined structure for sales teams to be more flexible and responsive to our clients. We\u2019ve enhanced our virtual selling capabilities, including co-creation with clients on virtual platforms, addressing client needs and solutions with real-time data and shifting to contactless delivery even for the most complex transformation projects. We\u2019ve created a virtual Dynamic Delivery Model to effectively reimagine services delivery, including improved access to expertise and enhanced business resiliency and security. We\u2019re transforming key business support functions to simplify our organizational structure and infuse AI into our workflows to deliver faster and better insights. And we\u2019re expanding our developer and ISV-centric ecosystem to drive workloads to our hybrid cloud platform. The last dimension of our business model I want to spend a minute on is our liquidity and balance sheet profile. We further strengthened our cash and our balance sheet in the second quarter, fueled by solid free cash flow, and we took additional measures to improve our liquidity position. We ended June with a cash balance of over $14 billion, up over $5 billion from the end of last year. We remained opportunistic in the capital markets, issuing $4 billion of debt across multiple tenors with very favorable economics. This provides us with additional liquidity in the short term while we remain committed to our longer-term deleveraging plans. Our debt of just under $65 billion was consistent with March, as our bond issuance was offset by $4 billion in term debt and commercial paper reductions. Our debt includes $22 billion of global financing debt, which is primarily in support of IBM products and services and has a stable credit portfolio. Recently, we also successfully completed our annual renewal of IBM\u2019s global credit facilities. We\u2019re maintaining over $15 billion in undrawn credit, one of the largest corporate facilities in the S&P. Our high-value business model and strong balance sheet and cash flows gave us the confidence to increase our dividend in this environment, the 25th consecutive year with an increase. Looking at the key highlights in the quarter, I\u2019ve mentioned our strong growth in cloud, and our continued momentum in Red Hat. The combination of Red Hat, our focus on productivity and operational efficiencies and our cloud scale-out drove significant operating gross margin expansion, up 160 basis points. Our balance sheet strength was enhanced by $2.3 billion of free cash flow this quarter. We had strong working capital performance, driven by stable collections and good financing attach rates, primarily on IBM Z. This was offset by higher net capital expenditures and workforce rebalancing payments. The CapEx increase was driven by the build-out of our cloud infrastructure and lower proceeds from real estate sales, while deemphasizing lower-value services content. In the quarter, we also continued to have free cash flow contribution from Red Hat, net of interest expense. Overall, we generated $11.5 billion of free cash flow over the last year, which is about 145% of GAAP net income. These results show solid free cash flow performance, and a strong financial profile. Now, I\u2019ll turn to the segment performance, beginning with Cloud and Cognitive Software, where revenue was up 5% driven by growth in Cloud and Data Platforms. Ninety days ago, we highlighted how software transactions stalled in March as clients quickly shifted their focus to resiliency efforts. That focus on resiliency continued into the second quarter and impacted software performance, especially in the first part of the quarter. Later in the quarter, demand improved for critical priority areas, such as hybrid cloud solutions and some AI applications. We had a sequential improvement in software renewal rates, as clients favored subscription models. Perpetual software licenses continued to be impacted, particularly in some of the more troubled industries. In Cloud and Data Platforms, revenue was up 30%. This reflects the synergy of bringing IBM and Red Hat together, as we\u2019ve standardized on Red Hat OpenShift as our hybrid cloud platform and modernized our software portfolio to run on it. This quarter, we had good performance across Red Hat, including amplified bookings growth in the 30 underpenetrated countries where IBM has helped Red Hat expand go-to-market efforts over the last year. And with further Cloud Pak traction this quarter, clients are embracing a hybrid cloud strategy and increasingly leveraging the OpenShift container platform. These actions all contributed to growth in the number of clients using our container platform to over 2,400. Cognitive Applications revenue declined, as clients in some of the more impacted industries deferred transformational or discretionary spending. We saw this play out in IoT engineering lifecycle management, where demand from automotive, electronics, and aerospace clients softened this quarter. These industries remained focused on core operations rather than transformational purchases. And our Weather consumer business was impacted by general weakness in the advertising market. In Transaction Processing Platforms, client focus on OpEx versus CapEx continued to impact transactions this quarter. Looking at the profit for the segment, the decline in pre-tax margin was primarily driven by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition. Now turning to our Services segments, Global Business Services revenue declined 6%. As we entered the year, GBS had good momentum and we expected revenue to accelerate throughout the year. But, as the pandemic intensified and the macroeconomic climate worsened, clients quickly shifted their focus to operational stability and cash preservation. This resulted in a delay in both the existing projects and new commitments, especially in projects that are more discretionary or with longer time to value, such as next-generation enterprise applications. The delays impacted the revenue coming out of backlog, which is about 80% of the quarterly revenue, as well as the smaller in-period signings, which yield revenue more quickly. While declines continued in these smaller signings from March through May, the trajectory improved, and we returned to modest growth in June. For the quarter, GBS cloud signings grew at a double-digit rate as clients are prioritizing their digital transformations. Offerings such as cloud strategy consulting, application development and modernization continued to grow revenue in the second quarter. These offerings, standardized on Red Hat\u2019s OpenShift platform, enable clients in their cloud journeys. We are working with an additional 60 clients such as Bank of America, Medtronic, Loblaws, Bank of England, Credit Mutuel, and Deutsche Telekom to utilize Red Hat technologies to transform their businesses. Looking at profit, we expanded gross margin in GBS by 240 basis points. We managed the business well in this environment, by leveraging our variable and global delivery resource model, improving price-margin realization, and optimizing utilization. We also had a currency benefit, which is fairly consistent with the last couple of quarters. At the same time, we are continuing to invest, building skills and practices through education and hiring. Overall, while we\u2019re dealing with some near-term macro challenges, GBS\u2019s deep industry expertise combined with IBM\u2019s, and now Red Hat\u2019s innovative technology, play a critical role in the acceleration of clients\u2019 digital transformations. In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 5%, fairly consistent with the first quarter\u2019s performance. We had signings growth in the quarter and strong growth in cloud revenue, but this was offset by continued declines in client business volumes. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, about 90 percent of GTS\u2019s quarterly revenue comes from contracts in our backlogs. While this business has a high mix of recurring revenues, there is some variability in that revenue stream. We provide clients with flexibility in their capacity to deal with volume changes due to their business needs and macroeconomic environment. As the pandemic intensified through the end of March and into the second quarter, we experienced lower client-based business volumes reflecting challenges across industries. While performance in some of these industries, like financial services was consistent quarter to quarter, other industries had a more significant decline. We saw this especially in retail, automotive, consumer goods, and travel and transportation. This impacted the revenue coming out of our backlog in the second quarter. At the same time, clients are continuing their infrastructure transformations to hybrid multi-cloud environments. For example, at Daimler, we have expanded our relationship to migrate their global aftersales platform to the IBM cloud. And, this quarter we announced Sabadell Mexico, the first 100% mobile bank in Mexico, will host its infrastructure on the IBM cloud, and use Red Hat Enterprise Linux to modernize its applications. They join other financial institutions like Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Lotte Card, and CaixaBank, among others, as they move forward on their cloud journey. These commitments contributed to the signings growth for GTS and, in fact, in the first half, signings grew at a double-digit rate. This results in an improved backlog trajectory from where we entered the year. Given the overall duration of the backlog, this will convert to revenue over a longer-term horizon. Looking at gross profit, GTS margin declined 30 basis points. This was driven by mix, as the high-value TSS business is impacted by the current product cycle. I\u2019ll remind you, we have not yet realized the benefits from our first quarter structural actions. Turning to Systems, revenue was up 6% this quarter, and gross margin expanded over 400 basis points. We again had good growth in both IBM Z and storage. Clients value the new innovation of the z15 mainframe and high-end storage. Similar to the first quarter, the z15 offered enterprises valuable capabilities, including remote management, security and importantly, scalability. This quarter, clients also increasingly looked to IBM Z for resiliency and business continuity to keep mission-critical workloads running smoothly. We continue to offer additional hybrid cloud capabilities on z15. We released Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z and launched a new cloud native development offering, Wazi Workspaces, which allows developers to use industry standard tools from IBM Z to multi-cloud platforms, optimized on OpenShift. The growth in Z and storage was partially offset by weaker performance in Power, reflective of where we are at in our product cycle and Power\u2019s client base of smaller enterprises, which are impacted more during this pandemic. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level. I think Arvind summed it up well. The current environment presents some near-term challenges for our clients, but it also provides some longer-term opportunities for us. We have a business profile and business model that provides some stability in the current environment. We have also recently taken a number of actions that strengthen our operating model for today, and for the future. We built a robust hybrid cloud platform based on what we firmly believe is the winning architecture. This technology-centric platform, together with our deep industry expertise and ecosystem partners will enable us to accelerate client digital transformations and move more of our clients\u2019 mission-critical workloads to the cloud. As we enter the second half, we have a compelling set of offerings and a strong pipeline across software, services, and systems. How that pipeline yields to revenue will ultimately be tied to the rate and pace of the economic recovery and the resulting client spending confidence. Given the uncertainty in the environment and consistent with our direction from last quarter, we are not going to provide guidance for 2020. But I do want to remind you of a few specific dynamics. Systems performance reflects where we are in a product cycle and we wrap on the IBM Z launch in September. In software, our transaction versus annuity mix varies by quarter. Historically, we have a lower mix of transactions in the third quarter, and our largest transactional base is in the fourth quarter. And then for Red Hat, we anniversaried the acquisition in early July. We are wrapping on a large part, but not all of the impact of the deferred revenue adjustment and transaction charges. We also wrap on the divestitures completed in the second quarter of last year. And the savings from our structural actions will start to yield in the second half, providing better cost competitiveness and margin performance, especially in GTS. Finally, we remain confident that we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to invest in our business and return value to shareholders through dividends. Arvind, any final comments?\nArvind Krishna: Jim, what\u2019s most important to me and to IBM, is that we emerge stronger from this environment with a business positioned for growth. And I am confident we can do that. My focus will be on investing and maintaining flexibility to take actions, not just to strengthen our operating model, but also to advance our strategic priorities. Now, over to Patricia for the Q&A.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Arvind. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we\u2019ve included supplemental information at the end of the presentation. And finally, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Sheila, let\u2019s please open it up for questions\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Thank you very much. Understanding you guys are looking to give formal full year guidance at this point, but just wondering you can spend a little bit more time about how we should think about moving into the third quarter versus seasonality where, I think typically you are down a little bit over $1 billion sequentially. And maybe just dig a little bit deeper into some of the biggest swinging factors we should be thinking about by segment going from 2Q into 3Q?\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Matt for the question. Let me start and then I will give it to Jim for adding a bit more color and a bit more detail. So, as both of us said on the call, we are seeing that there is \u2013 it\u2019s two-sided. We see opportunity in hybrid cloud, we see opportunity in digital transformation, we see opportunity in people as they are doing a return to the workplace and projects that all advance those things. Some of those give them long-term benefit, some give them short-term benefit. That said, we are seeing that there is a negative on things that require CapEx, things that have very long-term pay-offs, and project-based businesses. If we think about the difference in third and fourth quarters, third is a bit lighter on transactions, fourth is very heavy on transactions. If we also look at some of those project-based businesses, we will likely \u2013 and this is where it\u2019s tough to give guidance, but it\u2019s likely that we see that the economic recovery is looking to be longer and more protracted than we might have hoped for back in March. And as we see that bouncing ball on the economic recovery, whether it\u2019s in the United States, in Brazil, in India, that has an impact on all of these elements. But the other thing that is important in some of the remarks that Jim made, we kind of have a two-third to one-third mix, maybe if it\u2019s more than that in industries which are les impacted versus industries that are more impacted and that of course will play out in our results, as well. But let me give it to Jim to make some of those things more precise.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thank you very much for the question overall. As we stated, wrapping up the prepared remarks, we do have a very strong pipeline across our offering portfolio around systems, around software, around services. But as Arvind just indicated, the yield will be tied directly to the rate and pace of the recovery of the pandemic curves which by the way vary based on market around the world and industry, which tie directly to client spending confidence overall. If you look at just macro level dynamics of our business profile, there is a couple of things that I think will play out as we look forward. One is, we are going to wrap on divestitures, that\u2019s been a two point headwind to the IBM Company for the last four quarters. We wrap as we enter second half. Number two, we are dealing with actually a weaker dollar and you\u2019ll see in the currency back up, that is now flat to about one points of a headwind where we were dealing with about a 2 to 2.5 point headwind over the last few quarters. Three, the dynamics of client buying behavior is really shifting that acceleration to digital transformation and to cloud, you see it play out in our results and we actually have a strong pipeline. Red Hat had another very good quarter. Good pipeline set up. Our hybrid cloud solution offerings around Cloud Paks with good momentum. We got a good annuity base of business that we are going to continue to build on more renewal rates and we\u2019ve got a systems business that we refresh with new innovation. When you look at services, to your point, we\u2019ve got structural actions that are gone to start yielding as we exit \u2013 excuse me \u2013 as we enter second half and we got a strong pipeline as Arvind stated on the call of large transformational deals. Now those are always binary as to when they close, but they will reposition the emerging stronger theme of our backlog in services overall. In the mean time, we are going to continue to deal with the economic impact around discretionary projects, in particular around GBS.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Matt. Can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Yes. Next we will hear from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, my question is really around the cloud revenue growth which I think was about 34% this quarter. It was a really impressive acceleration from, I think, even what you guys said in the March quarter. Is there a way to think about, just how sustainable do you think this growth as we go forward? And then, when I think of this number, 34%, is there a way to see how much of this growth is from new logos and new wins on the customer side versus perhaps taking existing customers from an on-premise to a hybrid off-premise journey?\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Amit, let me start. This is Arvind. And then, we will ask Jim to add a lot more color. So, Amit, so clearly, since this is the last quarter where Red Hat was, I\u2019ll call it inorganic. That clearly had an impact on this. That said, we are still actually quite happy with the results despite that that had accelerated quite a bit from earlier and from both the first quarter and last year. So I\u2019ll just say it like that and leave it at that. The second part you asked was, are we just moving our people from one side to the other or are we getting new wins? Amit, the vast majority of this, there is a big core of Red Hat as I described, our hybrid cloud platform. That\u2019s not a left to right shift. That is actually net new. When we think about our wins in telecom, actually those are places we were never present, actually either of us, not just one of us. If you think about modernizing people\u2019s applications, that\u2019s not a shift, that\u2019s actually net new work for us. You asked about new logos, that may apply to a little bit of services. But for the company at large, look we have all the lines, I mean, almost any enterprise of any size is already our client, especially on the product side of the house. So talking about them being new logos would be unfair, but are we getting into areas within them that we previously did not have access to, I would say, we are absolutely doing that and that\u2019s a big part why you see that 34% growth. So, with that, let me give it to Jim for adding to that.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Just some color around how that 34% was actually delivered overall. Arvind talked about it from a client perspective in the value we bring around our hybrid cloud differentiated value proposition. But the 34%, Amit, as you indicated is up about 11 points sequentially quarter-to-quarter with regards to growth profile. That was driven pervasively across all four segments of our business. And in fact, there was 11 point sequential year-to-year improvement or quarter-to-quarter improvement was entirely organic. Red Hat contributes significantly to the 34% overall, but even on a pro forma organic perspective, we are growing right around 20%. We got a GTS business that has over a $9 billion book of business in our cloud portfolio that grew 20% this quarter and accelerated from first quarter. Our GBS business, which is about $5.5 billion, on a trailing 12 months grew in the mid-teens and our software business which is about a $5.5 billion book of business grew well in excess of 100%, but grew around 20 plus percent pro forma organically. So, I think we are seeing broad based acceleration really driven by the client buying behavior shifts that are happening in the marketplace. And to Arvind\u2019s prepared remarks overall, we feel pretty confident about the offering portfolio and the differentiated architecture around our hybrid cloud platform that positions us to continue to capitalize on that going forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Amit. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on linearity in the quarter relative to sort of normal linear patterns. It sounded like, software was a little worse in the first half of the quarter and then got a little bit better. I think there was one other business where you referenced things maybe looking a little better as the quarter progressed. So could you comment on whether that\u2019s a fair observation? And if it is, why shouldn\u2019t we be thinking about modeling normal or better than normal seasonality from Q2 to Q3? And then separately, could you just comment on GBS signings? It sounds like they were down, perhaps 20% year-over-year and what that might suggest for the GBS business trajectory over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Hi, Toni. You very astute in your observations about the linearity in the second quarter. So let me just add a little bit of color to that. When we finished the fourth quarter, we were quite transparent in saying that March was a lot worse than we expected compared to what we see. I wouldn\u2019t use the word linear because on the transactional side, the last month of the quarter is a lot more. So I\u2019ll just compare to normal, maybe as opposed to linear. When we entered second quarter, the energy side of the business yields pretty evenly other than the slight \u2013 I\u2019ll call it, maybe 4% to 5% in volume that goes up and down. So that side is linear approximately and that didn\u2019t change. When we look at the transactional side of the business, I would tell you that the month of May was significantly worse than we would normally expect and we saw that begin to come back in June but not really recover to normal levels. That\u2019s why I pause on saying, will 3Q be better because, since May was worse than June, but June was still worse than we might have expected last year. So, that\u2019s also something about that. And then, let me give it to Jim to also comment on the impact of the signings, as well as more on the imports linearity question.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. So, thanks, Arvind and thanks, Toni for the question. But as you indicated, with the heart of your question overall, the dynamics in March that we saw generally played out as we entered the first part of second quarter. Clients really continue to focus on mission-critical operational stability, cash preservation as any company as we were in the midst of the worst pandemic we\u2019ve seen in quite a period of time. And then I could even tell you, as CFO of the IBM Company, we were maniacally focused on liquidity. So, they are most unexpected. But what we see play out as we move through the quarter is really the demand profile is really correlating to the curves of the pandemic and that plays out differently around markets around the world, around industries around the world. And that\u2019s why we try to give some color about our geographic diversification, which we believe provides a natural hedge in this environment as many markets are going through different curves and our industry concentration being 70% in industries that are minimally or moderately impacted by the pandemic overall per Gartner and IDC. But when you look at the raining pace of that economic recovery as we said when we conclude the prepared remarks is really going to follow that pandemic. But when you look at our performance in the second quarter and not to repeat Arvind, but just give a little color by unit, our GBS business really stalled in the month of March after starting very strong through two months. That continued through the first two months of this quarter. In actually June, we saw our small transaction volume, which has high yielding revenue content going forward actually come back to growth and it was led by Europe, which stabilized with their pandemic curves and it was led by Asia Pacific. Actually, the Americas was the exact opposite, both Latin America and U.S. we started out pretty strong as the U.S. was getting the pandemic in curve underway and then when it started bouncing in June, we took a big step back. So that\u2019s what happened in GBS. CNC Software, very strong conclusion where value in hybrid cloud solutions, certain AI-specific Red Hat, very strong closure to the quarter. But I\u2019ll tell you one, we came off of a very strong second quarter, a large deal closure last year. So we had a very tough compare. But we didn\u2019t grow in the month of June. We were just much better than March and April and May. Systems finished pretty strong which is a testament to our value prop. And GTS, I\u2019ll tell you, GTS was kind of a mixture, 90 plus percent of that business is annuitized. We are dependent on client-based business volumes. That\u2019s 70% of industry. We actually saw stability and for the first time in a while, some growth in like financial markets, government, et cetera but we are getting impacted in GTS by client base business volumes in particular around airline, travel, transportation and retail.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Toni. Sheila, can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Arvind, you noted that the hybrid cloud opportunity is half in services. Do you see for IBM a larger opportunity at GBS or GTS? And any additional color on the GTS, GBS mix of those large transformational deals you alluded to in your prepared remarks will be helpful. And if I could, Jim, could you maybe also talk about the seasonality relative to cash flows in second half versus first half this year given the Red Hat contribution in the first half? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Alright. Thanks, Wamsi. So, I have mentioned explicitly that half the opportunity is services. But we look the market, that\u2019s a $1.2 trillion market for hybrid cloud and about $550 billion, you could say, maybe a touch more is a services opportunity. So that\u2019s the almost half. Within that, the bulk of the opportunity is in application modernization and improving the end-to-end workflows of our clients\u2019 processes. So when you look at those elements, and then you look at both private and public cloud, the nature of those operations is much more automated and much more captured in code than traditional infrastructure. That\u2019s my \u2013 I guess my technologist way of saying that the opportunity will be larger in GBS than GTS for those opportunities. However, just for a caution, with that said, the run component does remain important. It\u2019s not that it goes away, but in terms of pure dollar opportunities, it\u2019s shifting more towards the GBS side or that side of the market as opposed to the traditional infrastructure. And we are seeing that play out in the mix of the opportunities, because people need to get the work done first in terms of transforming their applications and that innovation is what is driving that interest and that\u2019s why you see us keep using the word transformational, because that is where people see the huge opportunity of these projects. And so, with that, Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Wamsi, thank you for the question overall around free cash flow and seasonality. In the first half, we delivered $3.6 million of free cash flow and $5.1 million of cash from ops. Cash from ops is about flat year-over-year. Our free cash flow is down about $400 million. That positions us on a trailing 12 month $11.5 billion I think in a very strong free cash flow realization. Let me give you some of the underlying dynamics and then I\u2019ll give you some color, given we are not giving forward-looking guidance, we are not going to give a free cash flow guidance here on the call, but to your question, I\u2019ll give you some color about seasonality and what were some of the headwinds, tailwinds. As we stated, when we entered January, very similar we talked about capital. We are going to continue to invest in this business. Capital through the first six months was a headwind of almost $0.5 billion. Our workforce rebalancing payments were a headwind predominantly in the first half. That will diminish as we get into second half and cash tax was a headwind through the first half already and that should be pretty consistent as we move forward. Offsetting some of that here in the first half is we\u2019ve had very strong working capital efficiency. Very strong collection rates, even in this environment talking to the testament, I think of the value and how essential we are to our clients in delivering mission-critical value and also we are in a mainframe cycle. So our IGF attach rates are doing quite well and that is helping our free cash flow overall. So, I assume as we move into the second half, we\u2019ll have similar dynamics around the headwinds. We start now in the second half as we anniversaried Red Hat. The profitability of Red Hat will start accelerating as we get into the second half. That should help us. We\u2019ll start reducing the amount of tailwind on working capital efficiency as we get through our Z cycle overall. And I think with regards to cash taxes, I stated pretty similar.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Next we will hear from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your may go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. A number of your peers, Accenture, SAP, Oracle have recently provided guidance. Is there something different about your business exposure? Or what you see in the market that is holding you back from providing guidance? And what is that that you are looking for in order to return to the prior framework of giving an annual outlook?\nArvind Krishna: Hi, Katy. Thanks for the question. I think it\u2019s to deal \u2013 I can\u2019t comment on, is the business different or do we see differently. I can comment on what we see. We have a lot of uncertainty in the economic environment around the globe. And when we look at it by geography, by continent or by industry, there is just so much variability that we can\u2019t answer it. In April when we said that we\u2019ll reevaluate it 90 days, maybe we were a little bit optimistic that we will get more stability on the health, which internally for the economic conditions, and that curves will begin to flatten in three to four months which was, at that time a reasonable, but turned out to be a misplaced expectation. And so, we just can\u2019t tell where those go. And because those have an impact, not in a month or two but over six to nine months, even on portions of the annuity business as Jim has been very clear, there is clients do get the ability to dial volumes up and down in some range. But that creates for us the inability to really want to give guidance that we are confident about. And so, it\u2019s that mixture of confidence and uncertainty, the economic that makes us unwilling to provide guidance.\nJim Kavanaugh: The only thing I would add, Katy, is that, it\u2019s not a statement of the confidence we have in our portfolio, our offerings, our strategy and our platform, what Arvind is trying to drive as the new CEO of the IBM company overall, we feel pretty confident in that and Arvind articulated that in his prepared remarks around our hybrid cloud strategy, our platform, our architecture and components of our business. As we see play out in the second quarter, this demand profile and the resulting client spending confidence is going to follow the pandemic curves around markets and around industries. And we saw that play out in the second quarter and we\u2019ll see how the world deals with the overall pandemic, the crisis and how we enable our clients and our employees and our communities to move forward. So, it is not prudent right now in this environment as we are still dealing with it that tie down our flexibility to move forward. We are going to continue to invest in our business and we have the right liquidity, strength of our balance sheet and investment in fin flex profile that take the right actions in this environment to advance our strategic priorities going forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Katy. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hey. Thank you so much. Arvind, you mentioned you are seeing large transformational projects in the pipeline. I think, Jim you underlined that a couple of times. I was curious how meaningful could this be unless we can compare it to past cycles. I recognize this is going to hinge a little bit on the world\u2019s healing. But, just trying to get a perspective on the sides in here. And then, also just as a second clarification, you talked about trading off the \u2013 the trade-off of OpEx versus CapEx, do you have pretty good line of sight at this point on your annuities business? It looks like transaction processing, for example is pretty stable quarter-to-quarter in terms of the year-on-year trends. I just want to make sure I didn\u2019t miss anything there. Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks. Thanks, Tien-tsin for the question. How meaningful can the large transformational projects be? So, when we say large, these are typically projects that measure in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars in contract value. But Tien-tsin, you do the peak times here and you say, pick a number, the $300 million, $400 million, $500 million in total contract value, and you do that and you say, those typically will give that full yield over five to seven years. That\u2019s the kind of nature they take and then you say, how many of those are we going to get done? We have a fairly large number of them in the pipeline. What we are hesitant to say is, will they take three, six, nine or twelve months to get closed fully, though we\u2019ve be in at it for a few months already. And so, I think it is quite meaningful if we begin to close them. We will absolutely see the needle move on our services business as those begin to close and yield. Relative to past cycles, I think as we came out past recessions, or as we came out of different crises I am not sure I can call the dot com burst is close quite, maybe it was minor recession, but it was a different year back, that second actually for sure and we saw then back of those kinds of projects different nature. Now they are about move into the cloud, journey to cloud, hybrid cloud transformation, then they were more about perhaps of the nature of outsourcing and beginning to create a lot of efficiency in infrastructure management. So the nature of these projects has changed. And so, let me \u2013 let Jim add color to it and also talk about the annuity business.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, I would just \u2013 thanks Tien-tsin for the question. I would just add to your last point. I think the nature and the rate and pace of those large transformational deals right now be much quicker than when we were sitting back in 2008 moving through this. It was a very different recessionary time that impacted industries differently and markets differently. This is more so of a consumer base small, medium market base, industry-specific base that is getting impacted at least immediately right now. But that time to value will shift over time as we move forward. So, I think Tien-tsin, when we went back and we\u2019ve done many different stress tests of our business model to ensure our balance sheet, our liquidity position, scenarios, we looked at prior recessions, we don\u2019t see anything different. The only difference is, where that client behavior and now shifting from a managed services years ago to more of a hybrid cloud asset base differentiation. The last thing on your annuity, we feel pretty confident about our annuity business. Over 60% of our revenue today, it\u2019s pretty stable. TPP is a mixture of some annuity or most annuities, I should say, some transactional. I think from an annuity perspective, we performing pretty consistent with the market overall and we see that continuing to play out here in the second half.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Tien-tsin. Sheila, can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question will come from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. Good afternoon. The TTF business, this appears to be all these different moving pieces, you are significantly impacted by volume, but it looks like you have pretty good signings in the first half of the year, duration is up in the backlog, et cetera. So, is there any way you could kind of sit through this for us? The cyclical impacts with it, we can get a better sense of how the transformation in that business is trending, particularly given the ongoing revenue challenges which we had over the last several quarters. And perhaps you could reconcile this, because Arvind, you made a comment seeing a shift to the applications layering from GTS to GBS, and maybe it\u2019s more informative to look at it on a combined basis. I mean, you are managing it under one person and now you are trying to move the two together. So, maybe you see more acceleration in GBS coming out of this and GTS maybe flat. So, just trying to get a better sense of how to think about the health of that business now and how it\u2019s trending?\nArvind Krishna: Okay. So, David, let me maybe start and then, I\u2019ll ask Jim to add color. So, we should acknowledge that we are never happy when a business is declining even at mid-single-digits. So let\u2019s just re-acknowledge that and then say, but then what are the elements under it, which is what you are asking about what are all the moving parts. And given the large annuity nature of that business, that does reflect signings and commitments from the past, not just within the quarter. So, that is there and that means that you are looking at the revenue impact that even if you have good signings that every impact takes a long time to sort of make its way through that business and also in terms of the backlogs that are in that business. So, when I look through the cyclical impacts there, I think that we want to be careful about trying to say that the trends change dramatically quarter-to-quarter. I think that those are places where it is going to take a while for the revenue trajectory in that business to change. And I am not sure that looking at it combined. It is important to be able to leverage the parts of the business with each other and there are some elements that can be leveraged and that is why you refer to Mark Foster\u2019s roles where he has both of those teams. However, they are very different businesses and they are different business models. So, I am not sure that I would say that looking at them combined is a better indicator of how they are trending. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. David, I would just add to that last point you just made. They are fundamentally different business models. While they are both, you mean, capital based, one is a datacenter managed services base business model that is highly capital-intensive. The other is a strategic capability industry lens project base business that is fundamentally human capital, not physical capital dependent. So they have different economic equations, different growth profiles. One is a growth engine, GBS. The other is a value based platform in GTS overall. Now, with all that said, we\u2019ve said all along that we\u2019ve got a leverage at least some in offering capability and to some extent at a client lens some leverage between those two. Because clients are making architectural decisions that are application first and infrastructure second. But the GTS business model overall and I would echo Arvind\u2019s point we\u2019ve been doing a ton of work around the portfolio. Looking at this backlog which by the way, any year, David, as you know quite well, about 80 plus percent of a year\u2019s out of that business is under contract. Now we do have variability collars within that of about 30% of our clients today have that. But this is long annuitized base contracts that has a duration of probably five plus years. So you don\u2019t turn that overnight. So when you take a look at that business, we\u2019ve been looking at it by offering, by client, by industry, by contract type, and we\u2019ve been trying to determine how do we won, reposition and leverage the value of incumbency and then also two, invest in new transformational services which is where the growth is coming in managed services building off of the back of the application side of GTS or it\u2019s GBS I should say. And that is things like cybersecurity, managed services, data, managed services, compliance services and alike. So, we\u2019ve got our arms around this, but it\u2019s going to take time to turn this business overall especially, in the pandemic.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, David. We are already at ten minutes after the hour. So why don\u2019t we take one more question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, thank you very much. Jim I\u2019ll direct it to you. I wonder if you could talk about Cloud and Cognitive a little bit and my question is, how should we be thinking about it? What I really want to dig into is, you are going to anniversary Red Hat for the first time, albeit you had some DR rate also it\u2019s going to complete anniversary. You are going to go ex mainframe cycle too. So, is there some impact on the transactions processing side or any other part of it? But all else equal, I would think that the growth rate over the next couple quarters is going to drop pretty meaningfully just given the anniversary of Red Hat, but perhaps combined with the mainframe cycle as well. But, what are the puts and takes you want us to think about over the next couple of quarters in Cloud and Cognitive?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Thank you, very much for the question as we wrap up right now. So let\u2019s take the Cloud and Cognitive business overall. Right, I think first from a Cloud and Data platform perspective, we are seeing very good growth overall. Yes, albeit very strong momentum on Red Hat and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the synergistic value we are bringing to our clients with regards to IBM and Red Hat that are together. To your question, we \u2013 Keith, we actually anniversary that on July 9. So, we will now wrap around on the operational performance of Red Hat going forward. Still growing nicely at an 18% historically normalized basis here in the second quarter. So we will still get growth off of that, but second to your other point, we\u2019ve been dealing with this deferred revenue non-cash purchase accounting adjustment for the last four quarters. That now starts lessening over time. So when you look at Cloud and Cognitive software with regards to Red Hat contribution in the first half of what we\u2019ve seen to the second half of where we are going forward, it\u2019s about a point or give or take of a headwind compared. But still a positive contribution to Cloud and Cognitive software overall. The other dynamic I\u2019d bring up and I think Arvind talked about this earlier, you got to make sure that this business, while 75% annuity, 25% give or take in a year transactional, that transactional skew varies very differently between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Second quarter and fourth quarter are more like 25% to 35% of a transactional skew. First and third quarter are more like a 15%. So, just based on that dynamic, when you look at 2Q to 3Q, we\u2019ll get more of a tailwind and then when as we get into fourth quarter, if the pandemic curves do not lessen over time, then we are still going to have to deal with this large perpetual license OpEx versus CapEx phenomenon overall. So with that, I will turn it back over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. So, let me make a couple of comments to wrap up this discussion. I hope everybody have taken away from this call is that while these are challenging times, we are excited about the opportunity that we have moving forward. I hope you got that from the remarks that both Jim and I made in the Q&A and in the prepared remarks. We have aligned our offerings to the opportunity. The opportunity being that of hybrid cloud, as well as AI. And I am certain we will continue to take the right steps to emerge stronger as a company. And I look forward to continuing this dialogue in the third quarter. In the mean time, I hope all of you stay safe and productive. Thank you.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay, Sheila I am going to turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. During our first quarter earnings call, I talked about how we are prepared for a wide range of outcomes given the economic uncertainty. Our second quarter results were within that range. We delivered $18.1 billion of revenue, expanded gross margin, reported operating earnings per share of $2.18 and continued to generate solid free cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to have ample liquidity. The external dynamics we saw in March continued into the second quarter, with varied impacts by region and industry. As we discussed in April, we are not immune to the macroeconomic environment. But our client and our portfolio mix provide some stability in our revenue, profit, and free cash flow. We saw that again this quarter. Let me remind you of how our business mix provides this stability. From a client perspective, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises, which in total have been relatively more stable throughout the pandemic. Though as you would expect, we saw more weakness from smaller enterprises this quarter. About 70% of our revenue comes from industries that run the world's most critical processes and those industries have been less impacted by the current economic and health crisis. We saw that in our results again this quarter, and in fact grew revenue in financial markets, government and education. From a geographic perspective, we have a global footprint of more than 170 countries. This provides a bit of a natural hedge, as we continue to see markets experience different impacts from the pandemic over time. And then finally, when you look at our portfolio, about 60% of our revenue comes from recurring revenue streams. While we've adapted quickly to conduct business virtually around the world, as expected, we did have disruptions in transactional performance and volume reductions. Many clients continued to delay projects, defer purchases, and favor OpEx over CapEx spending in this environment. This pause in large purchases and discretionary spending was most evident in our perpetual software licenses and project-oriented services. While clients remain focused on near-term priorities, running mission-critical processes, operational stability, and cash preservation, as Arvind mentioned, the last few months also highlighted the need for clients to accelerate their digital transformations, leveraging hybrid cloud and AI. Across IBM, our cloud revenue grew 34%, which is up from the 23% growth in the first quarter. IBM's hybrid cloud platform generated more than $23 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. With Red Hat, we are positioned to win the hybrid cloud architectural battle, and have developed the most secure, open hybrid cloud platform, underpinned by OpenShift. We've brought Red Hat and IBM technology together in our modernized Cloud Pak software solutions, providing the leading hybrid cloud platform. We now have over 2,400 clients using our container solutions and nearly 600 IBM Services clients utilizing Red Hat technology. Red Hat delivered strong results in the period with normalized revenue growth of 18%, driven by the synergistic effect of IBM and Red Hat. Last August, we talked about how Red Hat would benefit from IBM's incumbency in large accounts and leverage our global reach to expand into new markets. We're seeing that where IBM and Red Hat come together, clients are making larger scale architectural commitments and longer-term and more strategic purchases. This quarter we had a significant increase in the number of Red Hat large deals and expanded Red Hat's presence in underpenetrated focus markets. In the second quarter we took additional steps to better position IBM in this environment and emerge stronger. We announced new offerings including AI for IT and 5G edge and we recently added key capabilities in RPA and cloud security through two acquisitions. We are also working to fundamentally shift our operating model. We are simplifying the geographic dimension of our go-to-market by consolidating our operations and moving to a streamlined structure for sales teams to be more flexible and responsive to our clients. We've enhanced our virtual selling capabilities, including co-creation with clients on virtual platforms, addressing client needs and solutions with real-time data and shifting to contactless delivery even for the most complex transformation projects. We've created a virtual Dynamic Delivery Model to effectively reimagine services delivery, including improved access to expertise and enhanced business resiliency and security. We're transforming key business support functions to simplify our organizational structure and infuse AI into our workflows to deliver faster and better insights. And we're expanding our developer and ISV-centric ecosystem to drive workloads to our hybrid cloud platform. The last dimension of our business model I want to spend a minute on is our liquidity and balance sheet profile. We further strengthened our cash and our balance sheet in the second quarter, fueled by solid free cash flow, and we took additional measures to improve our liquidity position. We ended June with a cash balance of over $14 billion, up over $5 billion from the end of last year. We remained opportunistic in the capital markets, issuing $4 billion of debt across multiple tenors with very favorable economics. This provides us with additional liquidity in the short term while we remain committed to our longer-term deleveraging plans. Our debt of just under $65 billion was consistent with March, as our bond issuance was offset by $4 billion in term debt and commercial paper reductions. Our debt includes $22 billion of global financing debt, which is primarily in support of IBM products and services and has a stable credit portfolio. Recently, we also successfully completed our annual renewal of IBM's global credit facilities. We're maintaining over $15 billion in undrawn credit, one of the largest corporate facilities in the S&P. Our high-value business model and strong balance sheet and cash flows gave us the confidence to increase our dividend in this environment, the 25th consecutive year with an increase. Looking at the key highlights in the quarter, I've mentioned our strong growth in cloud, and our continued momentum in Red Hat. The combination of Red Hat, our focus on productivity and operational efficiencies and our cloud scale-out drove significant operating gross margin expansion, up 160 basis points. Our balance sheet strength was enhanced by $2.3 billion of free cash flow this quarter. We had strong working capital performance, driven by stable collections and good financing attach rates, primarily on IBM Z. This was offset by higher net capital expenditures and workforce rebalancing payments. The CapEx increase was driven by the build-out of our cloud infrastructure and lower proceeds from real estate sales, while deemphasizing lower-value services content. In the quarter, we also continued to have free cash flow contribution from Red Hat, net of interest expense. Overall, we generated $11.5 billion of free cash flow over the last year, which is about 145% of GAAP net income. These results show solid free cash flow performance, and a strong financial profile. Now, I'll turn to the segment performance, beginning with Cloud and Cognitive Software, where revenue was up 5% driven by growth in Cloud and Data Platforms. Ninety days ago, we highlighted how software transactions stalled in March as clients quickly shifted their focus to resiliency efforts. That focus on resiliency continued into the second quarter and impacted software performance, especially in the first part of the quarter. Later in the quarter, demand improved for critical priority areas, such as hybrid cloud solutions and some AI applications. We had a sequential improvement in software renewal rates, as clients favored subscription models. Perpetual software licenses continued to be impacted, particularly in some of the more troubled industries. In Cloud and Data Platforms, revenue was up 30%. This reflects the synergy of bringing IBM and Red Hat together, as we've standardized on Red Hat OpenShift as our hybrid cloud platform and modernized our software portfolio to run on it. This quarter, we had good performance across Red Hat, including amplified bookings growth in the 30 underpenetrated countries where IBM has helped Red Hat expand go-to-market efforts over the last year. And with further Cloud Pak traction this quarter, clients are embracing a hybrid cloud strategy and increasingly leveraging the OpenShift container platform. These actions all contributed to growth in the number of clients using our container platform to over 2,400. Cognitive Applications revenue declined, as clients in some of the more impacted industries deferred transformational or discretionary spending. We saw this play out in IoT engineering lifecycle management, where demand from automotive, electronics, and aerospace clients softened this quarter. These industries remained focused on core operations rather than transformational purchases. And our Weather consumer business was impacted by general weakness in the advertising market. In Transaction Processing Platforms, client focus on OpEx versus CapEx continued to impact transactions this quarter. Looking at the profit for the segment, the decline in pre-tax margin was primarily driven by the purchase accounting impacts from the Red Hat acquisition. Now turning to our Services segments, Global Business Services revenue declined 6%. As we entered the year, GBS had good momentum and we expected revenue to accelerate throughout the year. But, as the pandemic intensified and the macroeconomic climate worsened, clients quickly shifted their focus to operational stability and cash preservation. This resulted in a delay in both the existing projects and new commitments, especially in projects that are more discretionary or with longer time to value, such as next-generation enterprise applications. The delays impacted the revenue coming out of backlog, which is about 80% of the quarterly revenue, as well as the smaller in-period signings, which yield revenue more quickly. While declines continued in these smaller signings from March through May, the trajectory improved, and we returned to modest growth in June. For the quarter, GBS cloud signings grew at a double-digit rate as clients are prioritizing their digital transformations. Offerings such as cloud strategy consulting, application development and modernization continued to grow revenue in the second quarter. These offerings, standardized on Red Hat's OpenShift platform, enable clients in their cloud journeys. We are working with an additional 60 clients such as Bank of America, Medtronic, Loblaws, Bank of England, Credit Mutuel, and Deutsche Telekom to utilize Red Hat technologies to transform their businesses. Looking at profit, we expanded gross margin in GBS by 240 basis points. We managed the business well in this environment, by leveraging our variable and global delivery resource model, improving price-margin realization, and optimizing utilization. We also had a currency benefit, which is fairly consistent with the last couple of quarters. At the same time, we are continuing to invest, building skills and practices through education and hiring. Overall, while we're dealing with some near-term macro challenges, GBS's deep industry expertise combined with IBM's, and now Red Hat's innovative technology, play a critical role in the acceleration of clients' digital transformations. In Global Technology Services, revenue declined 5%, fairly consistent with the first quarter's performance. We had signings growth in the quarter and strong growth in cloud revenue, but this was offset by continued declines in client business volumes. As we've talked about in the past, about 90 percent of GTS's quarterly revenue comes from contracts in our backlogs. While this business has a high mix of recurring revenues, there is some variability in that revenue stream. We provide clients with flexibility in their capacity to deal with volume changes due to their business needs and macroeconomic environment. As the pandemic intensified through the end of March and into the second quarter, we experienced lower client-based business volumes reflecting challenges across industries. While performance in some of these industries, like financial services was consistent quarter to quarter, other industries had a more significant decline. We saw this especially in retail, automotive, consumer goods, and travel and transportation. This impacted the revenue coming out of our backlog in the second quarter. At the same time, clients are continuing their infrastructure transformations to hybrid multi-cloud environments. For example, at Daimler, we have expanded our relationship to migrate their global aftersales platform to the IBM cloud. And, this quarter we announced Sabadell Mexico, the first 100% mobile bank in Mexico, will host its infrastructure on the IBM cloud, and use Red Hat Enterprise Linux to modernize its applications. They join other financial institutions like Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Banco Santander, Lotte Card, and CaixaBank, among others, as they move forward on their cloud journey. These commitments contributed to the signings growth for GTS and, in fact, in the first half, signings grew at a double-digit rate. This results in an improved backlog trajectory from where we entered the year. Given the overall duration of the backlog, this will convert to revenue over a longer-term horizon. Looking at gross profit, GTS margin declined 30 basis points. This was driven by mix, as the high-value TSS business is impacted by the current product cycle. I'll remind you, we have not yet realized the benefits from our first quarter structural actions. Turning to Systems, revenue was up 6% this quarter, and gross margin expanded over 400 basis points. We again had good growth in both IBM Z and storage. Clients value the new innovation of the z15 mainframe and high-end storage. Similar to the first quarter, the z15 offered enterprises valuable capabilities, including remote management, security and importantly, scalability. This quarter, clients also increasingly looked to IBM Z for resiliency and business continuity to keep mission-critical workloads running smoothly. We continue to offer additional hybrid cloud capabilities on z15. We released Red Hat Ansible Certified Content for IBM Z and launched a new cloud native development offering, Wazi Workspaces, which allows developers to use industry standard tools from IBM Z to multi-cloud platforms, optimized on OpenShift. The growth in Z and storage was partially offset by weaker performance in Power, reflective of where we are at in our product cycle and Power's client base of smaller enterprises, which are impacted more during this pandemic. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level. I think Arvind summed it up well. The current environment presents some near-term challenges for our clients, but it also provides some longer-term opportunities for us. We have a business profile and business model that provides some stability in the current environment. We have also recently taken a number of actions that strengthen our operating model for today, and for the future. We built a robust hybrid cloud platform based on what we firmly believe is the winning architecture. This technology-centric platform, together with our deep industry expertise and ecosystem partners will enable us to accelerate client digital transformations and move more of our clients' mission-critical workloads to the cloud. As we enter the second half, we have a compelling set of offerings and a strong pipeline across software, services, and systems. How that pipeline yields to revenue will ultimately be tied to the rate and pace of the economic recovery and the resulting client spending confidence. Given the uncertainty in the environment and consistent with our direction from last quarter, we are not going to provide guidance for 2020. But I do want to remind you of a few specific dynamics. Systems performance reflects where we are in a product cycle and we wrap on the IBM Z launch in September. In software, our transaction versus annuity mix varies by quarter. Historically, we have a lower mix of transactions in the third quarter, and our largest transactional base is in the fourth quarter. And then for Red Hat, we anniversaried the acquisition in early July. We are wrapping on a large part, but not all of the impact of the deferred revenue adjustment and transaction charges. We also wrap on the divestitures completed in the second quarter of last year. And the savings from our structural actions will start to yield in the second half, providing better cost competitiveness and margin performance, especially in GTS. Finally, we remain confident that we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to invest in our business and return value to shareholders through dividends. Arvind, any final comments? Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thank you very much for the question overall. As we stated, wrapping up the prepared remarks, we do have a very strong pipeline across our offering portfolio around systems, around software, around services. But as Arvind just indicated, the yield will be tied directly to the rate and pace of the recovery of the pandemic curves which by the way vary based on market around the world and industry, which tie directly to client spending confidence overall. If you look at just macro level dynamics of our business profile, there is a couple of things that I think will play out as we look forward. One is, we are going to wrap on divestitures, that's been a two point headwind to the IBM Company for the last four quarters. We wrap as we enter second half. Number two, we are dealing with actually a weaker dollar and you'll see in the currency back up, that is now flat to about one points of a headwind where we were dealing with about a 2 to 2.5 point headwind over the last few quarters. Three, the dynamics of client buying behavior is really shifting that acceleration to digital transformation and to cloud, you see it play out in our results and we actually have a strong pipeline. Red Hat had another very good quarter. Good pipeline set up. Our hybrid cloud solution offerings around Cloud Paks with good momentum. We got a good annuity base of business that we are going to continue to build on more renewal rates and we've got a systems business that we refresh with new innovation. When you look at services, to your point, we've got structural actions that are gone to start yielding as we exit \u2013 excuse me \u2013 as we enter second half and we got a strong pipeline as Arvind stated on the call of large transformational deals. Now those are always binary as to when they close, but they will reposition the emerging stronger theme of our backlog in services overall. In the mean time, we are going to continue to deal with the economic impact around discretionary projects, in particular around GBS. Yes. Just some color around how that 34% was actually delivered overall. Arvind talked about it from a client perspective in the value we bring around our hybrid cloud differentiated value proposition. But the 34%, Amit, as you indicated is up about 11 points sequentially quarter-to-quarter with regards to growth profile. That was driven pervasively across all four segments of our business. And in fact, there was 11 point sequential year-to-year improvement or quarter-to-quarter improvement was entirely organic. Red Hat contributes significantly to the 34% overall, but even on a pro forma organic perspective, we are growing right around 20%. We got a GTS business that has over a $9 billion book of business in our cloud portfolio that grew 20% this quarter and accelerated from first quarter. Our GBS business, which is about $5.5 billion, on a trailing 12 months grew in the mid-teens and our software business which is about a $5.5 billion book of business grew well in excess of 100%, but grew around 20 plus percent pro forma organically. So, I think we are seeing broad based acceleration really driven by the client buying behavior shifts that are happening in the marketplace. And to Arvind's prepared remarks overall, we feel pretty confident about the offering portfolio and the differentiated architecture around our hybrid cloud platform that positions us to continue to capitalize on that going forward. Yes. So, thanks, Arvind and thanks, Toni for the question. But as you indicated, with the heart of your question overall, the dynamics in March that we saw generally played out as we entered the first part of second quarter. Clients really continue to focus on mission-critical operational stability, cash preservation as any company as we were in the midst of the worst pandemic we've seen in quite a period of time. And then I could even tell you, as CFO of the IBM Company, we were maniacally focused on liquidity. So, they are most unexpected. But what we see play out as we move through the quarter is really the demand profile is really correlating to the curves of the pandemic and that plays out differently around markets around the world, around industries around the world. And that's why we try to give some color about our geographic diversification, which we believe provides a natural hedge in this environment as many markets are going through different curves and our industry concentration being 70% in industries that are minimally or moderately impacted by the pandemic overall per Gartner and IDC. But when you look at the raining pace of that economic recovery as we said when we conclude the prepared remarks is really going to follow that pandemic. But when you look at our performance in the second quarter and not to repeat Arvind, but just give a little color by unit, our GBS business really stalled in the month of March after starting very strong through two months. That continued through the first two months of this quarter. In actually June, we saw our small transaction volume, which has high yielding revenue content going forward actually come back to growth and it was led by Europe, which stabilized with their pandemic curves and it was led by Asia Pacific. Actually, the Americas was the exact opposite, both Latin America and U.S. we started out pretty strong as the U.S. was getting the pandemic in curve underway and then when it started bouncing in June, we took a big step back. So that's what happened in GBS. CNC Software, very strong conclusion where value in hybrid cloud solutions, certain AI-specific Red Hat, very strong closure to the quarter. But I'll tell you one, we came off of a very strong second quarter, a large deal closure last year. So we had a very tough compare. But we didn't grow in the month of June. We were just much better than March and April and May. Systems finished pretty strong which is a testament to our value prop. And GTS, I'll tell you, GTS was kind of a mixture, 90 plus percent of that business is annuitized. We are dependent on client-based business volumes. That's 70% of industry. We actually saw stability and for the first time in a while, some growth in like financial markets, government, et cetera but we are getting impacted in GTS by client base business volumes in particular around airline, travel, transportation and retail. Wamsi, thank you for the question overall around free cash flow and seasonality. In the first half, we delivered $3.6 million of free cash flow and $5.1 million of cash from ops. Cash from ops is about flat year-over-year. Our free cash flow is down about $400 million. That positions us on a trailing 12 month $11.5 billion I think in a very strong free cash flow realization. Let me give you some of the underlying dynamics and then I'll give you some color, given we are not giving forward-looking guidance, we are not going to give a free cash flow guidance here on the call, but to your question, I'll give you some color about seasonality and what were some of the headwinds, tailwinds. As we stated, when we entered January, very similar we talked about capital. We are going to continue to invest in this business. Capital through the first six months was a headwind of almost $0.5 billion. Our workforce rebalancing payments were a headwind predominantly in the first half. That will diminish as we get into second half and cash tax was a headwind through the first half already and that should be pretty consistent as we move forward. Offsetting some of that here in the first half is we've had very strong working capital efficiency. Very strong collection rates, even in this environment talking to the testament, I think of the value and how essential we are to our clients in delivering mission-critical value and also we are in a mainframe cycle. So our IGF attach rates are doing quite well and that is helping our free cash flow overall. So, I assume as we move into the second half, we'll have similar dynamics around the headwinds. We start now in the second half as we anniversaried Red Hat. The profitability of Red Hat will start accelerating as we get into the second half. That should help us. We'll start reducing the amount of tailwind on working capital efficiency as we get through our Z cycle overall. And I think with regards to cash taxes, I stated pretty similar. The only thing I would add, Katy, is that, it's not a statement of the confidence we have in our portfolio, our offerings, our strategy and our platform, what Arvind is trying to drive as the new CEO of the IBM company overall, we feel pretty confident in that and Arvind articulated that in his prepared remarks around our hybrid cloud strategy, our platform, our architecture and components of our business. As we see play out in the second quarter, this demand profile and the resulting client spending confidence is going to follow the pandemic curves around markets and around industries. And we saw that play out in the second quarter and we'll see how the world deals with the overall pandemic, the crisis and how we enable our clients and our employees and our communities to move forward. So, it is not prudent right now in this environment as we are still dealing with it that tie down our flexibility to move forward. We are going to continue to invest in our business and we have the right liquidity, strength of our balance sheet and investment in fin flex profile that take the right actions in this environment to advance our strategic priorities going forward. Yes, I would just \u2013 thanks Tien-tsin for the question. I would just add to your last point. I think the nature and the rate and pace of those large transformational deals right now be much quicker than when we were sitting back in 2008 moving through this. It was a very different recessionary time that impacted industries differently and markets differently. This is more so of a consumer base small, medium market base, industry-specific base that is getting impacted at least immediately right now. But that time to value will shift over time as we move forward. So, I think Tien-tsin, when we went back and we've done many different stress tests of our business model to ensure our balance sheet, our liquidity position, scenarios, we looked at prior recessions, we don't see anything different. The only difference is, where that client behavior and now shifting from a managed services years ago to more of a hybrid cloud asset base differentiation. The last thing on your annuity, we feel pretty confident about our annuity business. Over 60% of our revenue today, it's pretty stable. TPP is a mixture of some annuity or most annuities, I should say, some transactional. I think from an annuity perspective, we performing pretty consistent with the market overall and we see that continuing to play out here in the second half. Yes. David, I would just add to that last point you just made. They are fundamentally different business models. While they are both, you mean, capital based, one is a datacenter managed services base business model that is highly capital-intensive. The other is a strategic capability industry lens project base business that is fundamentally human capital, not physical capital dependent. So they have different economic equations, different growth profiles. One is a growth engine, GBS. The other is a value based platform in GTS overall. Now, with all that said, we've said all along that we've got a leverage at least some in offering capability and to some extent at a client lens some leverage between those two. Because clients are making architectural decisions that are application first and infrastructure second. But the GTS business model overall and I would echo Arvind's point we've been doing a ton of work around the portfolio. Looking at this backlog which by the way, any year, David, as you know quite well, about 80 plus percent of a year's out of that business is under contract. Now we do have variability collars within that of about 30% of our clients today have that. But this is long annuitized base contracts that has a duration of probably five plus years. So you don't turn that overnight. So when you take a look at that business, we've been looking at it by offering, by client, by industry, by contract type, and we've been trying to determine how do we won, reposition and leverage the value of incumbency and then also two, invest in new transformational services which is where the growth is coming in managed services building off of the back of the application side of GTS or it's GBS I should say. And that is things like cybersecurity, managed services, data, managed services, compliance services and alike. So, we've got our arms around this, but it's going to take time to turn this business overall especially, in the pandemic. Yes. Thank you, very much for the question as we wrap up right now. So let's take the Cloud and Cognitive business overall. Right, I think first from a Cloud and Data platform perspective, we are seeing very good growth overall. Yes, albeit very strong momentum on Red Hat and we couldn't be more pleased with the synergistic value we are bringing to our clients with regards to IBM and Red Hat that are together. To your question, we \u2013 Keith, we actually anniversary that on July 9. So, we will now wrap around on the operational performance of Red Hat going forward. Still growing nicely at an 18% historically normalized basis here in the second quarter. So we will still get growth off of that, but second to your other point, we've been dealing with this deferred revenue non-cash purchase accounting adjustment for the last four quarters. That now starts lessening over time. So when you look at Cloud and Cognitive software with regards to Red Hat contribution in the first half of what we've seen to the second half of where we are going forward, it's about a point or give or take of a headwind compared. But still a positive contribution to Cloud and Cognitive software overall. The other dynamic I'd bring up and I think Arvind talked about this earlier, you got to make sure that this business, while 75% annuity, 25% give or take in a year transactional, that transactional skew varies very differently between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Second quarter and fourth quarter are more like 25% to 35% of a transactional skew. First and third quarter are more like a 15%. So, just based on that dynamic, when you look at 2Q to 3Q, we'll get more of a tailwind and then when as we get into fourth quarter, if the pandemic curves do not lessen over time, then we are still going to have to deal with this large perpetual license OpEx versus CapEx phenomenon overall. So with that, I will turn it back over to Arvind."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. I am pleased to be speaking with you again. In April's call, I talked about the impact of the global public health crisis and I told you about the important work we are carrying out to help the shifting needs of our clients. I also told you about the confidence I have in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud, as well as data and AI, all of this continues. Today there are two topics I'd like to cover. First, I want to tell you about what we're seeing in the market and then, I want to discuss our priorities and actions we have taken to move them forward. From a market perspective, while the current environment poses certain short-term challenges, it also presents long-term opportunities that IBM will seize, as our clients accelerate their shift to hybrid cloud and AI. The essential work that we do in terms of running our clients' mission-critical processes continues. More profoundly, we see that the digital transformation of businesses is accelerating. Our second quarter results demonstrate this, with an increase of over ten points in our cloud revenue growth over last quarter. The trend we see in the market is clear. Clients want to modernize apps, move more workloads to the cloud and automate IT tasks. They want to infuse AI into their workflows and secure their IT infrastructure to fend off growing cybersecurity threats. As a result, we are seeing an increased opportunity for large, transformational projects. These are projects where IBM has a unique value proposition. But they are also projects that take time to shape and therefore to close. At the same time, we are feeling the impact of austerity measures that businesses have put in place to preserve cash and capital. Our software and services results reflect this reality. Jim will take you through this in more detail. Taken altogether, this is the backdrop of our results for this quarter. They reflect the immediate challenges and long-term opportunities of this environment. Now, let me move on and discuss my priorities moving forward. As I touched upon in our last call, IBM is focused on helping our clients in the two major transformational journeys they are on: hybrid cloud as well as data and AI. Hybrid cloud is the dominant force driving change in our industry, but it's far from universal adoption. Only 20% of the workloads have moved to the cloud. The other 80% are mission-critical workloads that are far more difficult to move. There is a massive opportunity in front of us to capture these workloads. When I say hybrid cloud, I am talking about an interoperable IT environment across on-premise, private, and publicly operated cloud environments, in most cases from multiple vendors. Why do we believe this is the future, rather than a pitstop along the way? Clients find that choosing a hybrid cloud approach is two-and-a-half times more valuable than relying on public cloud alone. This considers factors such as innovation, development time and portfolio optimization. Let me spend a minute to describe our hybrid cloud platform. It starts with Linux, which is the de facto operating system standard. We have a tremendous advantage with Red Hat Linux, which is the market share leader. Linux, along with Containers and Kubernetes, provides the architectural foundation of our platform, and OpenShift is our core product that captures all this and more. IBM has a vast software and middleware portfolio, which has now been containerized and runs on OpenShift and Red Hat Linux. The family of Cloud Paks we introduced in the second half of last year allows our middleware to run in a cloud-native environment and bridge our clients from the past to the future. This means clients can now deploy our software anywhere OpenShift runs. It is infrastructure agnostic, across not just public and private clouds, but also our mainframes and power system platforms. OpenShift is also what makes it possible to develop and consume software in a new way. It's what enables DevSecOps and all the subsequent boosts in productivity, security, and speed of deployment. Our hybrid cloud platform also includes a set of advanced technologies, such as Watson, analytics, encryption, IoT and many others. What gives our hybrid cloud platform the fuel it needs to accelerate adoption and become pervasive is the large ecosystem of partners we are building. We have gone to great lengths to forge a global coalition of best of breed ISVs. This includes recent additions like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, Box and Slack. All are using our hybrid cloud platform to help clients modernize mission-critical workloads. We have done the same with major systems integrators Ernst & Young, Infosys, Wipro, Tata Consultancy Services, Tech Mahindra, Persistent Systems, all are examples that are helping expand the reach of IBM's hybrid cloud platform. Finally, you'll recall that nearly half of the hybrid cloud opportunity lies in services. An important part of our platform's value lies in the expertise we provide to help clients on their journey, whether that's modernizing apps, building cloud-native apps, migrating to the cloud or managing these applications on the public and private cloud infrastructures. We are currently helping hundreds of major clients on these journeys. I believe that our strategic vision is taking hold in the marketplace. I mentioned the acceleration in our cloud growth this quarter to over 30%. This hybrid cloud platform generated over $23 billion of revenue over the last 12 months. I just described the importance of Red Hat Linux and OpenShift to our platform, and Red Hat continued its momentum in the quarter, with the combination of IBM and Red Hat driving strong revenue and bookings growth. Across the board, we are seeing greater demand for Red Hat products. Clients are eager to tap into open source innovation. They want the freedom to securely deploy, run and manage their data and applications on the cloud of their choice and retaining that choice is critical. Clients such as Bharti Airtel, American Express, Vodafone, Broadridge Financial Solutions, Banco Sabadell, and CaixaBank all see the value in a hybrid cloud architecture built by IBM and Red Hat. As part of our hybrid cloud strategy, a key focus is to help clients tackle complex and highly regulated workloads. Last year, we launched the financial services-ready public cloud with Bank of America and we recently created a new program for ISVs and SaaS, Software-as-a-Service, providers. I am happy to share that we now have 30 ISVs signed up. This happened with great speed, and I am confident that more will join soon. So, let me pause for a moment and remind you of the three priorities I shared with IBMers on my first day as CEO: One, help our clients on their journey to cloud and AI. Two, win the architectural battles in cloud with Red Hat. Three, continually delight our clients. These priorities remain the same, and you can see how we have made progress in all of them. At the same time, we have continued to deliver a series of new innovations in the last quarter. We launched our new edge and telco network cloud solutions built on Red Hat OpenStack and Red Hat OpenShift that enables clients to run workloads anywhere, from a data center, to multiple clouds, to the edge. We also launched our AI for IT offering to give every CIO the ability to automate their IT infrastructure that immediately reduces cost and becomes more resilient. AI for IT runs across any cloud and works in collaboration with an ecosystem of partners that includes Slack and Box. On quantum computing, we added an additional four systems, which expands our fleet to 22 quantum computing systems. That includes eight systems that have demonstrated a quantum volume of 32, a yardstick IBM has proposed to measure the relative power and usefulness of quantum computers. I've talked previously about the importance of both organic and inorganic investment to drive innovation. We recently announced two acquisitions that will enhance our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. In June, we acquired Spanugo to boost our compliance and cybersecurity capabilities for the hybrid cloud. And, in early July, we agreed to acquire WDG Automation that advances AI-infused automation capabilities into our Cloud Paks. Needless to say, this is a unique and challenging time for our clients. To continue to be their most trusted partner, we are spending a lot of time and energy to drastically simplify how our teams go to market. We are doing a lot of work on the back-end to bring our portfolio together in a more cohesive fashion, so our teams can come with simpler and more relevant proposals. We are also focused on changing our culture and operating model, so we can make decisions more quickly and make our interactions with clients a lot more experiential. Jim will take you through a few of our more recent actions. Moving forward, we will continue to take actions that improve our operating model and accelerate our strategic priorities so that we can emerge stronger. Before turning to Jim, let me end by saying a few words on our commitment to corporate social responsibility. This has always been important to IBM. But, as you know with the current events in the United States, there has been a renewed focus to do more. As IBM's CEO, I am fully committed to ensuring that IBM will continue to lead in this area. But this is also about skills and creating opportunity. Since 2011, IBM has helped to develop and expand a new public-education model called PTECH. P-TECH provides high school students from underserved backgrounds with the skills and credentials they need for competitive jobs in STEM. To that end, we recently made a commitment to hire 1,000 interns who come from P-TECH. To put this in context, we have between 5,000 and 10,000 interns at IBM each year. So this represents more than ten percent of our intern base. I am always happy to expand later on this and other topics relating to our ESG efforts. Now, back to the quarter and the business, Jim is going to take you through our results. Jim, over to you. Jim, what's most important to me and to IBM, is that we emerge stronger from this environment with a business positioned for growth. And I am confident we can do that. My focus will be on investing and maintaining flexibility to take actions, not just to strengthen our operating model, but also to advance our strategic priorities. Now, over to Patricia for the Q&A. Thanks, Matt for the question. Let me start and then I will give it to Jim for adding a bit more color and a bit more detail. So, as both of us said on the call, we are seeing that there is \u2013 it's two-sided. We see opportunity in hybrid cloud, we see opportunity in digital transformation, we see opportunity in people as they are doing a return to the workplace and projects that all advance those things. Some of those give them long-term benefit, some give them short-term benefit. That said, we are seeing that there is a negative on things that require CapEx, things that have very long-term pay-offs, and project-based businesses. If we think about the difference in third and fourth quarters, third is a bit lighter on transactions, fourth is very heavy on transactions. If we also look at some of those project-based businesses, we will likely \u2013 and this is where it's tough to give guidance, but it's likely that we see that the economic recovery is looking to be longer and more protracted than we might have hoped for back in March. And as we see that bouncing ball on the economic recovery, whether it's in the United States, in Brazil, in India, that has an impact on all of these elements. But the other thing that is important in some of the remarks that Jim made, we kind of have a two-third to one-third mix, maybe if it's more than that in industries which are les impacted versus industries that are more impacted and that of course will play out in our results, as well. But let me give it to Jim to make some of those things more precise. Okay. Amit, let me start. This is Arvind. And then, we will ask Jim to add a lot more color. So, Amit, so clearly, since this is the last quarter where Red Hat was, I'll call it inorganic. That clearly had an impact on this. That said, we are still actually quite happy with the results despite that that had accelerated quite a bit from earlier and from both the first quarter and last year. So I'll just say it like that and leave it at that. The second part you asked was, are we just moving our people from one side to the other or are we getting new wins? Amit, the vast majority of this, there is a big core of Red Hat as I described, our hybrid cloud platform. That's not a left to right shift. That is actually net new. When we think about our wins in telecom, actually those are places we were never present, actually either of us, not just one of us. If you think about modernizing people's applications, that's not a shift, that's actually net new work for us. You asked about new logos, that may apply to a little bit of services. But for the company at large, look we have all the lines, I mean, almost any enterprise of any size is already our client, especially on the product side of the house. So talking about them being new logos would be unfair, but are we getting into areas within them that we previously did not have access to, I would say, we are absolutely doing that and that's a big part why you see that 34% growth. So, with that, let me give it to Jim for adding to that. Hi, Toni. You very astute in your observations about the linearity in the second quarter. So let me just add a little bit of color to that. When we finished the fourth quarter, we were quite transparent in saying that March was a lot worse than we expected compared to what we see. I wouldn't use the word linear because on the transactional side, the last month of the quarter is a lot more. So I'll just compare to normal, maybe as opposed to linear. When we entered second quarter, the energy side of the business yields pretty evenly other than the slight \u2013 I'll call it, maybe 4% to 5% in volume that goes up and down. So that side is linear approximately and that didn't change. When we look at the transactional side of the business, I would tell you that the month of May was significantly worse than we would normally expect and we saw that begin to come back in June but not really recover to normal levels. That's why I pause on saying, will 3Q be better because, since May was worse than June, but June was still worse than we might have expected last year. So, that's also something about that. And then, let me give it to Jim to also comment on the impact of the signings, as well as more on the imports linearity question. Alright. Thanks, Wamsi. So, I have mentioned explicitly that half the opportunity is services. But we look the market, that's a $1.2 trillion market for hybrid cloud and about $550 billion, you could say, maybe a touch more is a services opportunity. So that's the almost half. Within that, the bulk of the opportunity is in application modernization and improving the end-to-end workflows of our clients' processes. So when you look at those elements, and then you look at both private and public cloud, the nature of those operations is much more automated and much more captured in code than traditional infrastructure. That's my \u2013 I guess my technologist way of saying that the opportunity will be larger in GBS than GTS for those opportunities. However, just for a caution, with that said, the run component does remain important. It's not that it goes away, but in terms of pure dollar opportunities, it's shifting more towards the GBS side or that side of the market as opposed to the traditional infrastructure. And we are seeing that play out in the mix of the opportunities, because people need to get the work done first in terms of transforming their applications and that innovation is what is driving that interest and that's why you see us keep using the word transformational, because that is where people see the huge opportunity of these projects. And so, with that, Jim? Hi, Katy. Thanks for the question. I think it's to deal \u2013 I can't comment on, is the business different or do we see differently. I can comment on what we see. We have a lot of uncertainty in the economic environment around the globe. And when we look at it by geography, by continent or by industry, there is just so much variability that we can't answer it. In April when we said that we'll reevaluate it 90 days, maybe we were a little bit optimistic that we will get more stability on the health, which internally for the economic conditions, and that curves will begin to flatten in three to four months which was, at that time a reasonable, but turned out to be a misplaced expectation. And so, we just can't tell where those go. And because those have an impact, not in a month or two but over six to nine months, even on portions of the annuity business as Jim has been very clear, there is clients do get the ability to dial volumes up and down in some range. But that creates for us the inability to really want to give guidance that we are confident about. And so, it's that mixture of confidence and uncertainty, the economic that makes us unwilling to provide guidance. Thanks. Thanks, Tien-tsin for the question. How meaningful can the large transformational projects be? So, when we say large, these are typically projects that measure in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars in contract value. But Tien-tsin, you do the peak times here and you say, pick a number, the $300 million, $400 million, $500 million in total contract value, and you do that and you say, those typically will give that full yield over five to seven years. That's the kind of nature they take and then you say, how many of those are we going to get done? We have a fairly large number of them in the pipeline. What we are hesitant to say is, will they take three, six, nine or twelve months to get closed fully, though we've be in at it for a few months already. And so, I think it is quite meaningful if we begin to close them. We will absolutely see the needle move on our services business as those begin to close and yield. Relative to past cycles, I think as we came out past recessions, or as we came out of different crises I am not sure I can call the dot com burst is close quite, maybe it was minor recession, but it was a different year back, that second actually for sure and we saw then back of those kinds of projects different nature. Now they are about move into the cloud, journey to cloud, hybrid cloud transformation, then they were more about perhaps of the nature of outsourcing and beginning to create a lot of efficiency in infrastructure management. So the nature of these projects has changed. And so, let me \u2013 let Jim add color to it and also talk about the annuity business. Okay. So, David, let me maybe start and then, I'll ask Jim to add color. So, we should acknowledge that we are never happy when a business is declining even at mid-single-digits. So let's just re-acknowledge that and then say, but then what are the elements under it, which is what you are asking about what are all the moving parts. And given the large annuity nature of that business, that does reflect signings and commitments from the past, not just within the quarter. So, that is there and that means that you are looking at the revenue impact that even if you have good signings that every impact takes a long time to sort of make its way through that business and also in terms of the backlogs that are in that business. So, when I look through the cyclical impacts there, I think that we want to be careful about trying to say that the trends change dramatically quarter-to-quarter. I think that those are places where it is going to take a while for the revenue trajectory in that business to change. And I am not sure that looking at it combined. It is important to be able to leverage the parts of the business with each other and there are some elements that can be leveraged and that is why you refer to Mark Foster's roles where he has both of those teams. However, they are very different businesses and they are different business models. So, I am not sure that I would say that looking at them combined is a better indicator of how they are trending. Jim? Thanks, Jim. So, let me make a couple of comments to wrap up this discussion. I hope everybody have taken away from this call is that while these are challenging times, we are excited about the opportunity that we have moving forward. I hope you got that from the remarks that both Jim and I made in the Q&A and in the prepared remarks. We have aligned our offerings to the opportunity. The opportunity being that of hybrid cloud, as well as AI. And I am certain we will continue to take the right steps to emerge stronger as a company. And I look forward to continuing this dialogue in the third quarter. In the mean time, I hope all of you stay safe and productive. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Welcome, and thank you for standing by. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma\u2019am, you may begin.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations for IBM, and I want to welcome you to our first quarter 2020 earnings presentation.I\u2019m here with Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll post today\u2019s prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.Some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the Company\u2019s SEC filings.Our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures, to provide additional information to investors. For example, we present revenue growth at constant currency throughout the presentation. In addition, to provide a view consistent with our go-forward business, we\u2019ll focus on constant currency growth adjusting for the divested businesses for the impacted lines of total revenue, cloud and our geographic performance.We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation, and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC.I\u2019d like to make two other comments regarding this quarter\u2019s presentation. First, consistent with our last two quarters, IBM\u2019s revenue, profit and earnings per share reflect the impact of purchase accounting and other transaction-related adjustments associated with the acquisition of Red Hat. These adjustments and charges are primarily non-cash. Second, our segment structure for 2020 remains consistent with 2019. So, with the beginning of this year, we realigned a couple of offerings between segments, resulting in very modest adjustments. Our results reflect this realignment, and we\u2019re providing a view of first quarter 2019 on that recast basis in today\u2019s supplemental slides and two years of historical recast data on our website.So, with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Hello, everyone. As you all know, we are in the midst of an unprecedented global public health crisis. I\u2019d like to pause for a moment and say that my heart goes out to all those dealing with COVID-19. One of the first commitments I made was to be transparent and open, not just with our employees and our clients and partners, but with our investment community as well. In that spirit, I will participate, not just today, but in earnings calls from now on. There are a few topics I\u2019d like to cover with you today. First, I\u2019ll revisit areas I\u2019ve talked about; second, I\u2019ll tell you about what we have accomplished in the last two weeks; and finally, I\u2019ll tell you about areas I intend to focus on in the near future; and then, I\u2019ll quickly touch upon our Q1 results.Let\u2019s start with the areas I\u2019ve talked about. I have told our team, it is essential that we deepen our understanding of our clients\u2019 journey to hybrid cloud and AI, which will result in hybrid cloud as the fourth platform. We remain obsessed with continually delighting clients. And we further established IBM as the gold standard for good tech. All these are underpinned by our culture that fosters growth and an entrepreneurial mindset. I see these as our collective priorities. I\u2019ll move on to what\u2019s been done in the last few weeks.Despite the challenges we\u2019re facing as a result of a global crisis, we\u2019ve remained steadfast in our commitment to employees, clients, and society at large. More than 95% of our 350,000 IBMers are working remotely now. In addition, about 8,000 of them remain at essential sites to carry out mission-critical work. As our clients adjust to this new normal, they need a partner they can trust. IBM is that partner. This isn\u2019t just about helping our clients navigate the crisis, but to ensure that that they emerge stronger and more resilient. To that end, we have taken concrete steps to bundle existing offerings to address the shifting needs of clients, such as leveraging hybrid cloud, using AI for automation, and enabling remote work.Another area we\u2019ve been focusing on has been to mobilize IBM and IBMers to help with the global battle against COVID-19. Here are some examples: The computing power, over 360 petaflops that we have helped convene for researchers; the weather channel, COVID-19 county by county map, which saw more than 40 million visits in the first week of launch; the AI assistants that can answer citizens\u2019 questions about COVID-19, 21 of them live today, and nearly 90 being rolled out; and educational resources available to anyone anywhere. We\u2019re doing great work, helping the city of New York and are delivering 300,000 tablets with educational software and free cellular data connections that can help students learn remotely.When we add this all up, we have done the math. In just a few weeks we have already committed over $200 million in terms of contributions and volunteer time. I\u2019m extremely proud of IBM\u2019s response to COVID-19.Now, I want to tell you about some areas of focus for the near future. I want to be clear. The ultimate outcome that I am absolutely committed to is growth for our Company as we emerge from the pandemic. A key area of focus is to ensure that IBM leads in the two major transformational journeys our clients are on, cloud and AI. IBM has already built three enduring platforms, mainframe, services and middleware. The fourth one is hybrid cloud. Clients however need more than a platform. They need a deep industry expertise. This is why the services that clients rely on to build and manage the hybrid cloud platform, is a massive opportunity for IBM. It\u2019s nearly half of the $1.2 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity.IBM, together with Red Hat, have unique sources of competitive advantage we can leverage to win the architectural battle for cloud. There\u2019s our open source and security leadership, our deep expertise and trust, but also the fact that we give clients that unique ability to build mission critical applications once and run them anywhere. Together with Red Hat, we are establishing Linux, Containers and Kubernetes as the new standard. This is winning the architectural battle for hybrid cloud.Let\u2019s talk a little bit on how we take this to clients. I want IBMers to lead with a more technical approach. I want our teams to showcase the value of our solution as early as possible. Likewise, there must be a relentless focus on quality. Our products must speak for themselves in terms of user experience, design and ease of use.My approach is straight forward. I am going to focus on growing the value of the Company. This includes better aligning our portfolio around hybrid cloud and AI to meet the evolving needs of the market. We will continue investing including acquisitions. As you have seen, we have divested parts of software and services that did not align with our focus areas. This will continue.The past few weeks have catapulted us into the world of virtual selling and remote delivery. These entail new ways of working. This is a reminder we should always be asking ourselves, is there a better way to do this? If you don\u2019t question why you\u2019re doing things, you\u2019ll never evolve into something better. What\u2019s clear is our confidence in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud and AI.Before turning to Jim, I want to comment on our results. In the first quarter, we had modest revenue growth. That\u2019s net of currency and divestitures. We entered the quarter in a good position with momentum from the end of last year. However, in the last few weeks we faced a shift in client priorities, towards the preservation of capital. This impacted software disproportionately, and Jim will comment more on this later. Other parts of our business maintained modest momentum. We are entering this challenging environment from a relative position of strength. Our clients are enterprises that run the most essential processes of the world. Our balance sheet is strong, and Jim is going to take you through that.I believe that what we are going through today with the shift to remote work, automation, application modernization will accelerate our clients\u2019 shift to hybrid cloud. This gives me immense confidence in our future.So, I will turn it over to Jim to take you through the quarter and then will come back at the end for Q&A.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thank you, Arvind. I want to start out by expressing my sympathy to all those who have been impacted by this health crisis and deep gratitude to the incredible people who have been helping IBM, our clients and the world to deal with this crisis, especially those on the frontline.Now, turning to our first quarter. We delivered $17.6 billion of revenue with modest growth net of currency and divestitures. We had good gross margin expansion, operating earnings per share of $1.84 and continued solid free cash flow.Before I get into the specifics of the quarter, in light of the current environment, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on a few areas. First, on our client base, our portfolio and our financial profile, which you\u2019ll see provides some stability to our business; second, what we saw at the end of the quarter; and then finally, add on to Arvind\u2019s comments on what we\u2019re doing with our own business to address the current environment.IBM has always focused on the enterprise space and within that, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises. For decades, we have run our client\u2019s most critical processes, like core banking systems, supply chains, and claims processing. From an industry perspective, the majority of our revenue comes from clients in financial services, telecom and the public sector, including government and healthcare. We have long-term relationships with these clients in the form of multiyear services contracts, recurring software streams and financing arrangements.As a result, when you look at our business mix, about 60% of our annual revenue is in recurring businesses. While we\u2019re not immune in this environment to disruptions in the transactional content and volume reductions, our client profile and annuity base provides some level of stability, not only in our revenue, but also in profit and cash as we manage through these challenging times.Looking at the first quarter, through February, we were tracking roughly in line with our expectations. As we got into March, the health situation and resulting social distancing became more widespread. As you would expect, we saw a noticeable change in client priorities. With that, there was effectively a pause as clients understandably dealt with their most pressing needs. This was most pronounced in our software business, where the vast majority of transactions typically closed in the last two weeks of the quarter. For those clients that did engage at the end of the quarter, there was a noticeable change in priorities where focus very quickly shifted to the stability of their operations and preservation of cash. They moved ahead with spending that addressed immediate and essential needs, including running mission-critical processes and securing a remote workforce.For example, we increased infrastructure capacity and services to meet unprecedented demands on critical banking functions for banks in countries ranging from Italy and Spain to the United States, to Australia and Singapore. In Brazil, we developed a platform and a single week to connect patients to doctors via telemedicine. And at a major U.S. insurance company, we helped 40,000 employees to work remote, when they had absolutely no work-at-home capabilities just two weeks earlier. At the same time, the last few weeks have only reinforced the need for clients to modernize their businesses for the new world, and cloud and AI are at the core of their digital reinventions.With our hybrid cloud and AI platforms, together with our expertise in running critical processes, we\u2019re ideally positioned to guide clients on their journeys. Anthem is a great example of a company accelerating their digital reinvention in today\u2019s COVID-19 environment. We\u2019re helping them to operate with more agility and provide greater quality of service, by leveraging data and deep insights to enhance the experience of their 41 million members. We are doing this on a secure, open platform run on Red Hat and the IBM Cloud.Now in parallel, we\u2019ve taken actions within our own business to help IBM better operate in this environment and emerge stronger. For example, we are aligning investments to the key offering areas Arvind mentioned. We took structural actions to improve the competitiveness of our Global Technology Services business, and enable new ways of working across our operations. Our actions will deliver annualized gross savings of nearly $2 billion.We are accelerating our own digital transformation from demand generation to further ramping up our digital sales capability. And in our supply chain, we are leveraging AI, blockchain and IoT technologies to drive faster and smarter decisions with our suppliers. We also enhanced health and safety measures at our sites to maintain our manufacturing operations at required capacity to meet our customers\u2019 needs. This caps off a lot of work over the last few years to make our supply chain more flexible and resilient.While we\u2019re supporting our clients and improving the flexibility and competitive position of our operations, we are also taking actions to enhance IBM\u2019s balance sheet strength and liquidity position. We accessed the debt market in early February, with a $4 billion issuance, while reducing $4.5 billion of current and 2021 refinancing needs. In addition, while we do not rely on commercial paper for our funding needs, we thought it was prudent to take advantage of our access to the CP market. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper, which increased both our debt and cash balances. As a result, we ended March with a cash balance of $12 billion, which is up $3 billion from year-end. Our total debt of $64 billion includes $22 billion of global financing debt, which is in support of IBM products and services, and has a stable credit portfolio.Finally, as we discussed in January, our pension plans were well funded at the end of 2019, with worldwide qualified plans funded at 102%. While we typically don\u2019t provide a status during the year, I can say that our overall pension funded status in March was fairly consistent with year-end, and we do not see a change to our expected plan contributions in 2020.Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in the business. We\u2019ll continue to be opportunistic in the capital markets, while remaining fully committed to our mid-to-high single A credit rating and our targeted leverage ratio. I\u2019ll remind you we also have over $15 billion of unused credit facilities. And while we have no plans to draw on the facilities, they are available as backup liquidity, and our debt covenants are well within the required levels. And with our share repurchase program suspended since the Red Hat acquisition, our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our dividend.So, with that as a backdrop, let me focus on few highlights in the quarter, before getting into the segments. We had strong cloud performance again this quarter, with cloud revenue up 23%. By bringing together our technology and expertise to help our clients accelerate their journeys to cloud, our cloud revenue has grown to $22 billion over the last 12 months.Arvind talked about the winning cloud architecture of Linux, Containers and Kubernetes, and the acquisition and integration of Red Hat bolsters our position in hybrid cloud. Red Hat momentum continued this quarter, with normalized revenue growth of 20%, and strong bookings and backlog growth. RHEL has proved to be mission-critical for many customers, particularly in this environment, and Infrastructure revenue was again up double-digits. Application Development and emerging technologies was up nearly 40% this quarter, driven by OpenShift and Ansible.The number of Red Hat large deals was up from the fourth quarter, and up about 50% over last year. Red Hat signed the two largest deals in its history, leveraging IBM\u2019s deep client relationships. This is a great proof point of the value of IBM and Red Hat together. We see it in the larger Red Hat deals, in the pipeline of IBM services engagements based on Red Hat\u2019s technologies, and in the number of clients now using Red Hat and IBM\u2019s container solutions. This has grown to over 2,200, as Red Hat and IBM have emerged as the leading container platform.The contribution of Red Hat, together with strong margin performance in our services businesses contributed to our 150 basis points of operating gross margin expansion. Our pre-tax income reflects charges of nearly $900 million primarily for the structural actions to improve our competitiveness in GTS, and accelerate our shift to a cognitive enterprise. The charges for these actions were more than offset by non-cash discrete tax benefits.You\u2019ll recall I mentioned both the structural actions and the discrete tax benefits back on our call in January, and so these had been planned for some time. Our cash and balance sheet strength are fueled by healthy free cash flow. This quarter we generated $2.1 billion of cash from operations, and $1.4 billion of free cash flow, both excluding our financing receivables. There is a lot of seasonality in our free cash flow, and over the last year we generated $11.6 billion, which is about 125% of GAAP net income.And a final comment on Red Hat\u2019s contribution to our free cash flow. When we closed Red Hat back in July, we expected Red Hat, net of interest expense, to be accretive to free cash flow by the end of the first year. With Red Hat\u2019s strong performance, after three quarters, we\u2019ve now achieved that milestone.Now, let me turn to the segment results, starting with Cloud & Cognitive Software, which grew 7% this quarter. We had strong performance in Red Hat, IoT and Data & AI, and in our security services. Just as I did for overall IBM, I\u2019ll start with a view of software dynamics as we moved through the quarter.We entered the year with a robust offering portfolio and solid pipeline, and we had double-digit revenue growth through February. In March, our software transactions stalled nearly overnight, as our clients shifted their focus to resiliency efforts. We saw those dynamics play out most notably in Cognitive Applications, where many transformational deals were paused, especially in the retail industry. And in Transaction Processing Platforms, given cash concerns, clients traded off CapEx for OpEx. These are typically large engagements, and in this environment, clients elected to defer purchases, impacting perpetual license sales late in the quarter. More than offsetting that, we continue to have good growth in Cloud and Data Platforms, led by Red Hat and the synergies we\u2019re realizing by bringing together Red Hat and IBM software.Given the shifting software demands we\u2019ve seen in some parts of the business, we are focused on a number of initiatives heading into the second quarter. We\u2019re doubling down on areas that facilitate the shift to cloud, including Red Hat and other cloud and data platform offerings, Cloud Paks for operational efficiency and QRadar on Cloud for security threats. Our go-to-market teams are accelerating their shifts to digital channels. And we\u2019re now leveraging our partner ecosystem to expand our reach into critical industries and markets.To sum it up, our portfolio in Cloud & Cognitive Software is aligned to the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity. We\u2019ve modernized our software to be cloud native and optimized on OpenShift, which provides a compelling hybrid cloud platform for clients on their digital journeys to cloud. While we expect near-term pressure on transactions, we continue to invest in new development and innovation for our hybrid cloud and AI strategy.Turning to Global Business Services. We entered the year with good momentum in revenue, gross profit and signings, and our backlog returned to growth. This growing backlog and the revenue we expected to yield from it, gave us confidence that GBS revenue performance would accelerate as the year progressed. We had solid performance in GBS in the first quarter, with revenue growth of 1%, and gross profit margin expansion of 100 basis points.Our Consulting revenue grew 5%, led by offerings that help clients with their digital reinventions such as cloud advisory and application modernization, and offerings that leverage AI to inject intelligence into business processes. These offerings enable clients to reengineer their business processes and IT environments for speed, flexibility, and efficiency to better serve their end-users. We have standardized our cloud application modernization offerings on OpenShift, and built the world\u2019s largest Red Hat consulting practice. We are now working with over 100 clients on Red Hat technologies, such as Anthem, Procter & Gamble, USAA, Santander, and Horizon Healthcare, just to name a few.In the first quarter we also had good growth in many of the transformational offerings like next-generation enterprise applications. But as the impact of COVID-19 intensified in March, clients began to deprioritize some of these projects. In this environment, we are aligning our go-to-market and delivery resources to the near-term opportunity, addressing challenges like engaging customers virtually, modernizing and migrating applications to the cloud, empowering a remote workforce, and cybersecurity and IT resiliency.Internally, we have shifted from a predominantly face-to-face engagement model to a virtual one, now with almost 100 percent of our GBS delivery resources not only working remotely, but productively working to support our clients.Over the last few weeks we\u2019ve gotten questions from investors on our ability to support clients given the shutdown in some countries. I can tell you that in India, we had over 98% of our practitioners working remotely within 48 hours of lockdown. As we look forward, we have a solid base of business and a growing backlog, though in the near term, we expect customers to continue to delay and replan some projects. We are going to continue to prudently manage the business by leveraging our variable and global delivery resource model, to ensure utilization is balanced with the rate and pace of backlog consumption and new deals. And we\u2019re going to continue to build skills and practices, so that as the demand returns to more normal levels, we\u2019re ready to address it.Turning to Global Technology Services. Our revenue decline of 4% was fairly consistent with last quarter\u2019s performance, and we expanded gross profit margin by 30 basis points. As I\u2019ve said in the past, we are managing this business for margin and cash contribution.Last quarter, I talked about the actions to accelerate the shift to higher value segments of the market and improve our cost competitiveness. So, let me start with a quick update on our progress.A significant portion of the first quarter\u2019s structural actions addressed GTS. This improves our position for the future but impacted our PTI in the first quarter. In this dynamic environment, we are going to continue to evaluate the cost competitiveness of this portfolio, and we\u2019ll take further actions as required. We also advanced our joint offerings and go-to-market capabilities with GBS. As clients shift their mission-critical workloads to the cloud, they are looking for integration across the application and infrastructure stack.By more tightly integrating GBS and GTS, we\u2019re providing a differentiated solution. While we are in the initial stages of this work, we see some early indications of progress in our signings this quarter. Both total signings, and our cloud signings grew at a double-digit rate. This includes significant engagements at Caixabank and Anthem. Strong signings contributed to an improved total Services backlog, which is now roughly flat year-to-year. Within that, cloud now represents over 40% of our outsourcing backlog. This fuels our GTS cloud revenue, which was up 12% this quarter.In the current environment, enterprises are focused on infrastructure solutions, which enhance IT resiliency and business continuity, address new cybersecurity risks, and reconfigure their IT environments for cost efficiency and business agility. We are prioritizing our resources and our management system to these opportunities, focusing on offerings like unified communications, business continuity and resiliency, workplace virtualization and enabling remote working. At the same time, we are adopting alternative delivery models as we continue to support mission-critical workloads without service interruption. In fact, almost 100% of our employees in our GTS global delivery centers are now working remotely.While in this environment we expect to have some impact due to lower business volumes, this will ultimately lead to an acceleration in the shift of mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And as I\u2019ve said, this will be a hybrid multi-cloud environment, built on open standards. IBM Services will leverage our incumbency, our industry, regulatory and business process expertise and of course Red Hat to capture this opportunity.And so now looking at Systems, revenue was up 4% this quarter, and gross margin expanded over 400 basis points. In an environment where client behavior shifted at the end of the quarter, our hardware portfolio held up well. This reflects the importance of IBM Z and high-end storage for mission-critical operations, as well as product cycle dynamics. These are high-end systems, and client value in this segment is driven by new innovation. We see that in the z15 mainframe. And we see it in Storage, with the high-end DS8900 introduced at the end of 2019, and more recently, a new and simplified distributed storage portfolio, which supports hybrid multi-cloud deployments.In the second full quarter of availability, the z15 proved to be a crucial backbone of enterprise operations, providing a stable, secure, and scalable platform. Our financial services clients were able to scale up their capacity to meet the significant demands from unprecedented spikes in market volatility without touching their physical infrastructure. And in high-end storage, which is tightly integrated with the mainframe, we had a good quarter, especially in support of mission-critical banking workloads.The growth in Z and storage was partly offset by a decline in Power. This reflects where we are in our product cycle, as well as the fact that Power is more skewed to smaller enterprises, which were more impacted by the dynamics in March. We\u2019re continuing to adapt our operations to meet the needs of clients most effectively, especially in this changing environment. We\u2019re expanding the digital sales channel for both the Storage and Power business. And we\u2019re leveraging technology to proactively manage our globally diversified supply chain.Now after going through the segments, I want to bring it back up to the IBM level and talk about what this means going forward. First and foremost, we have confidence in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Nothing we\u2019ve seen over the last two months causes us to waiver from these priorities. In fact, as Arvind said upfront, we believe the challenges clients are facing today will speed their transitions to digital. That bodes well for us. But there is obviously some dislocation in the near term.In this environment, we\u2019ve taken quick and prudent actions to manage our cost and expense, further improve our liquidity position, and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger. Since the crisis began, we\u2019ve been stress testing our model, and running a number of scenarios based on various assumptions.Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the health crisis, and the rate and pace of economic recovery, there is a wide range of outcomes for the year, which we are prepared for. But to assign probabilities to the assumptions during these unprecedented times just isn\u2019t valuable. As a result, it is prudent to withdraw our expectations for full year 2020, and we will reassess at the end of the second quarter. Though to be clear, under the various scenarios we ran, we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to support our business and secure our dividend.Before turning back to Arvind, I want to provide some perspective on how we\u2019re entering the second quarter. Over the last few years, our software transactional content in the second quarter is about 20% to 25% of our software revenue. We have a solid pipeline of deals, but in the end, our software performance will depend on how we yield against that pipeline. If we continue to see the same client buying behavior, it\u2019s reasonable to expect the second quarter will be more challenging.Systems hardware is essentially all transactional. Here too, we have a good pipeline in IBM Z and storage. While the current environment is expected to impact closure rates, I would expect less of an impact to Z and storage, given the essential nature of the purchases and the additional capacity requirements, especially in certain industries.In services, we\u2019ve made real progress in the backlog, and for the first time in a while, we ended the quarter with services backlog essentially flat versus last year, that\u2019s with GBS up and GTS down modestly. About 80% of the GBS revenue and 90% of the GTS revenue in a quarter has historically come from the opening backlog, though our contracts adjust for flexible volumes in our clients\u2019 businesses. As mentioned earlier, close to 100% of our people in our service delivery centers are working remotely.Looking at our cost and expense, we\u2019re closely managing our spending and capitalizing on new and efficient ways of operating. The savings from structural actions will start to yield in the second half. We are likely to take additional actions in the second quarter. I\u2019ll remind you that we are well positioned from a liquidity perspective and remain focused on driving our free cash flow including robust working capital management.For years, we\u2019ve been talking about our high-value portfolio and business model, and in times like these that really matters. This is why our liquidity position is naturally strong, and our pension plan is well funded coming into this environment. So, we\u2019re prepared for this environment, have a strong financial position, and compelling value propositions for clients, but our near-term performance will ultimately be influenced by client buying patterns in this economic environment.Arvind, I\u2019ll turn it back over to you.\nArvind Krishna: Thank you, Jim.We have taken the importance of transparency seriously, and so it was a tough decision to withdraw guidance. But these are unprecedented times, and this quarter is not the time to declare that we have clarity, that does not benefit us, and it does not benefit you as investors and analysts.With better clarity on the economic recovery, we will provide an update at the end of the second quarter. But please know there\u2019s a difference between the ability to accurately predict a near-term revenue or earnings per share number, and confidence in our business over the longer term. And I have confidence in our business. Under different scenarios, we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to support the business and secure our dividend. We are entering this environment from a position of strength.So, over to Patricia for the Q&A.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Arvind.Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, you\u2019ll notice we updated our chart format to streamline the information presented during the webcast. The content no longer presented in the mainline charts is now included in our supplemental information, which is at the end of the slide deck. And finally, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot guys for the opportunity. And Arvind, congrats on the spot, and nice to have you on the Q&A session. You guys -- Arvind, you spent a fair amount of time kind of talking about the areas where you want to focus on as you go forward. And maybe to put aside the COVID discussion, how do you think about the investments the Company needs to do? And how do you go about that organic versus inorganic? I just wanted to understand, when you think of investments, which way are you going to skew as you go forward. And maybe on the flip side of the coin, are there things that you want to focus less on; are there things and opportunities to divest to further potentially help your balance sheet?\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Thanks, Amit. Let me start with talking about the portfolio and your questions on investment.So, look, obviously the portfolio is something I evaluate deeply. We do it all the time and continuously. But, I do want to caution that in the immediate period, which is right now, we got to focus and put our priority on supporting our employees and clients. Now, investment to us encompasses both, encompasses both organic investments and inorganic, or acquisitions. We\u2019ve been clear that we will acquire when we find properties that are both attractive or that fit our strategy. And hybrid cloud and AI are the focus of our business going forward. But, when we talk about hybrid cloud, it is an all-in. And I\u2019ll just give a quick reflection on Red Hat. We had Linux as the core, you had OpenShift surrounding it. We put all of our middleware on OpenShift. We have hundreds of GBS projects already leveraging both the Cloud Paks and OpenShift to make application modernization. And then eventually we\u2019ll find services also running those modernized applications for our clients.You\u2019ll find there are many, many properties in that -- in my broader definition of hybrid cloud that\u2019ll fit that and ditto on AI, where AI should be looked upon as the way to get the value out of the data that people collect, both their internal data and external data. Now, I don\u2019t want to also comment on big or small. Size is not a priority. It\u2019s about being thoughtful and strategic. And so, you should expect that over time, over time meaning just that as it gets past the next few months, we will get back to an acquisitive strategy. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. The only thing I would add to Arvind is our capital allocation strategy obviously is there to support the business design and the business and portfolio strategy that we have chosen. To your point around hybrid cloud, data AI, we\u2019ve got enough fire power with regards to a strong balance sheet, solid free cash flow generation, solid investment grade, a good access to market, which we talked about in the prepared remarks that gives us ample free cash flow and flexibility to invest in our business, while also returning value to our shareholder in securing that dividend that we talked about upfront. And that acquisition component is a very big important part of our capital allocation strategy, and that hasn\u2019t changed.\nPatricia Murphy: Sheila could we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: You mentioned some changes in go-to-market in your prepared remarks, leading perhaps to the more technical bent. I wonder if you can elaborate there a bit. And Jim, I appreciate you\u2019re not providing explicit guidance at this point. But maybe can you address the levers that Company has in responding to the pandemic in the context of preserving cash flows? You alluded to a few things in your prepared comments as well, but last call you had mentioned several puts and takes of the cash flows as tailwind and headwind, and just wondering if you could maybe recast those again.\nArvind Krishna: With respect to a more technical approach to selling, it\u2019s a journey we have been on, but actually the current crisis in effect catapulted us or accelerated what we are doing. And I\u2019ll touch on sort of three elements. We have always wanted to have our product teams do a lot of demonstrations and proof-of-concepts that we are now going to them virtually, where we stand the properties up on our public cloud and then allow the clients to sort of play around with them. And so, you take away the weeks of doing it in a more traditional manner.Second, in our services teams, they\u2019re doing a lot of what they call virtual garages. So, a garage used to be that we would have our consultants and our implementers sit side-by-side with our client and go do those. But, when you do have social distancing and it\u2019s not just us, our clients don\u2019t really want us on premise either, they have now become virtual garages, but there\u2019s an advantage there by the way. A bigger advantage is it allows you to actually get access to skills that are around the globe, not just those that may be physically co-resident at a client. And that is again not much more technical approach. And then, third with a lot of remote delivery happening in the GTS part of the business, they are also bringing a much more technical solution to bear through this. So, those are the elements that I mentioned, but you can expect us to do more and more of this as we go along.And Jim, I\u2019ll give it to you for the second part.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Hello, Wamsi. Thanks for the question, because this is important. As you can imagine, given the unfortunate and unprecedented situation everyone around the world is dealing with right here with COVID-19, we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time on our business profile, our business model, stress testing it, running multiple scenarios, as I said in the prepared remarks. But, when you look at it, it\u2019s always been done around one, the long-term sustainability of the IBM Company to deliver value for our clients and for our investors. And that means you\u2019ve got to have a strong balance sheet, you\u2019ve got to have ample liquidity that gives you flexibility to continue to invest, so that we emerge stronger as we get through this pandemic, when we move forward. And that really -- simplistically, if you take a step back, it\u2019s two levers. One is on the top-line in revenue and the others on the fundamentals of your operating leverage in the business. Both of those deliver that free cash flow in that cash. And in that latter part, I would put in there optimization of your balance sheet.And we\u2019ve looked at our revenue portfolio, as we talked about in our prepared remarks. We believe we are differentiated, although we\u2019re not immune from what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. We do have some level of stability in our revenue, our profit, our cash, and that\u2019s driven by all of the work that we\u2019ve done over time to transform this Company, transform and optimize our portfolio. We went from -- in 2008, at the last recession, we were only about 45%, 47% annuity. We are now north of 60%. We have always been focused on large enterprise versus consumer SMB, and that is playing out well.Our industry concentration, as I said on the prepared remarks, over 70% of our revenue sits in industries based on IDC and Gartner that are going to be either moderately or minimally impacted by COVID-19. So, we are diversified along geographic dimensions, market dimensions, industry dimensions, client dimensions that gives us that strong annuity content to move forward.And then on the margin and balance sheet, we\u2019re going to optimize as we\u2019ve always done, the portfolio shift in the higher value, the structural actions we just got done here in the first quarter, $900 million that impacted our PTI in the first quarter. That by the way will give us a annualized return of over 2x. And we\u2019ll keep watching our credit portfolio and the quality, our deferred revenue, and also our DPO and DSO which is in very good shape. So, net of that is, we feel confident around ample financial flexibility, ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business as we move forward and secure that dividend.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Wamsi. Can we please go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. Arvind, welcome, and great to have you on the call. I was wondering if you could maybe define or articulate on a scale of 1 to 10. How different do you think IBM\u2019s portfolio businesses will be two years from now? I recognize change is not going to happen imminently. But 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely different, where would you place that? And then, Jim, if you could just, very quickly, you talk a lot about the stability of IBM\u2019s portfolio. But it looks like year-over-year, pre-tax income went from over $2.2 billion to under $1.6 billion, if I back out the restructuring and charge. So, even though revenues weren\u2019t impacted, PPI, adjusted for the restructuring, was down nearly 30%, and this is your lowest transactional quarter. Is that how we should be thinking about changes to profit going forward, or was there something unique about this quarter where we saw more negative leverage? Thank you, both.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Toni. Look, Toni. If we look at our industry, it\u2019s a fast-moving industry with a lot of change that goes on all the time. If I look at where we were five years ago, and if I fast forward to today, Red Hat was not there, Cloud Paks were not there. Our cloud backlog inside services was a tiny and fraction of what it is today. And I would look at all of that and say it looks like in aggregate, likely about half our business has changed in the last five to seven years. That\u2019s, I think, the hallmark of a successful company. When you begin to change it, it takes advantage of the relationship, the value, the incumbency we have with our clients and it also takes advantage of the fast move -- fast moving nature of technology.Now, the question you didn\u2019t ask what I thought I\u2019d put in there is the questions of the focus. I think the focus is going to be much more around what we\u2019ve been talking about it, is going to be around in the near term, is going to be around hybrid clouds and AI, with likely quantum coming down the road, which I do believe has a $0.5 trillion worth of value to give back to our clients since you give me the five-year horizon, not just one or two-year horizon. So, let me sort of begin with that and say that. And it\u2019s hard to put that on a scale of 1 to 10 because you didn\u2019t tell me how much of it changes in 10. But I gave you the sense that probably half of things change. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Toni, thank you very much for the question, because operating leverage is obviously one of the core fundamental pillars of our high value based thesis and high value based business model overall. But, let me just cut to the chase with regards to your question overall. You asked about it from a pretax income, I\u2019ll take it down to an EPS level, which was similar to net income. We were down 18% overall. That EPS was down $0.41 year-to-year. Yes, it includes the $900 million worth of restructuring and the structural charges also includes as we guided back in January, a discrete tax event. But, the thing that you\u2019re missing in that equation is all of the Red Hat integration and non-cash related purchase accounting implications that are in our EPS and in our profit number.Now, as we close that transaction -- by the way, less than three quarters ago, and we feel very confident about the health and the profile of our Red Hat business overall. We took a substantial write-down with regards to that deferred revenue, $2.2 billion overall. And we talked about Red Hat being free cash flow accretive year one and being operating EPS accretive at the end of year two.We already hit the milestone on the first metric and we\u2019re well on our way delivering the progress on the second metric. And just to bring this all home, the EPS of a $1.84, down $0.41 year-over-year. About $0.35 to $0.38 of that $0.41 is the Red Hat, non-cash deferred revenue and integration. Why do I bring that up? Because as we said, that will diminish over time. And as we continue to replenish the backlog, which we are and we\u2019ll talk about, and we wrap around those expenses, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to get even more substantial operating leverage going forward in the future.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Toni. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. You line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Yes. Thank you very much. And welcome to the call, Arvind. I appreciate the commentary in the prepared remarks about what you guys saw during the month of March. I wonder if you could extend that a little bit and just talk about what you\u2019ve seen so far across the first few weeks of April, across the segments and just the extent to which if any you\u2019ve had customers asking for price concessions, new concern -- new terms, given the more recurring pieces of your business?\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Thanks, Matt. Let me start with that because look from -- April tends to be a month where, as Jim pointed out, it\u2019s not just in the first quarter. And every -- in every quarter, larger transactions do tend to get bunched up at the end of the quarter. I\u2019d say that probably is more June than April. And you also asked a question on the energy [ph] side of the business or what I would call subscription. We haven\u2019t seen, at least so far any big change in the subscription side, coming into April. Now that is no doubt because as both of us have pointed out, we do tend to run our client\u2019s mission critical workload. It\u2019s not the workload that\u2019ll be the first to turn off. If anything, it\u2019ll be amongst the last to get impacted. And so, the subscription side, we feel quite good about it. Now, on the transaction side, so far things are holding up, but it\u2019s too early to tell. That\u2019s one of the reasons you heard what Jim and I talk about withdrawing guidance because of a little bit of a progress is not enough give us a full view into what will happen this quarter. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Matt, thank you very much for the question. So, Arvind kind of gave a perspective of what we\u2019re seeing here for the first couple of weeks. And as you stated, just given the one transactional versus annuity nature, second quarter like fourth quarter is our highest transactional quarter, particularly in our software base of business overall. But, let me give you a little perspective around the month of March versus February quarter-to-date, because I think it\u2019s important for investors to understand the value of our high value based business model and integrated business model. Because the unfortunate COVID-19 situation that\u2019s impacting economies around the world, has a very different profile across our business, whether it\u2019s hardware, software and services. And as we\u2019ve seen coming through February, the IBM Company was growing revenue through February, led by strong double-digit growth in software overall. The month of March, as I said in the prepared remarks, as the healthcare crisis intensified, that\u2019s where we saw the fundamental shift in client buying behavior, appropriately, so by the way as we\u2019ve done in IBM, where first and foremost you wanted to focus on the operational stability and business continuity of your enterprise and second around the preservation of cash. But, when you look at it, it was more pronounced in our software and our GBS business.We actually substantially grew in the month of March in our hardware portfolio. But, I would align that more around bringing new innovation to market. We\u2019re in this cycle of mainframe and we did very well with the attach of storage overall. And our GTS business, remember, is a strong annuity base and it\u2019s running mission critical work and our outsourcing IS business actually got better by 1 point quarter-to-quarter. So, that\u2019s pretty stable. But within GBS and software, interesting around software, our cloud and data platform, 34% growth, yes, driven by Red Hat, but even on a normalized organic basis, we grew over 3%. And that\u2019s really the instantiation of our hybrid cloud thesis with Red Hat overall. So, that part of the portfolio is still executing well. And I think that\u2019s part of what Arvind said, clients are now even faster, more accelerating their journeys to cloud. And it plays right to that.Now, where we got hit was in Cognitive Applications and in Transaction Processing Platform, two different phenomenons across that portfolio. Our Cog Apps is much more centered around industry related content where industries that are getting more impacted disproportionately, like retail, like industrial, like automotive. And in TPP that was a function of just the preservation of cash shifting away from CapEx and OpEx. And just concluding GBS, although we\u2019re very pleased, remember 90 days ago, we talked about accelerating momentum in GBS. We turned that business back to backlog growth. We actually delivered growth in the quarter, strong growth in consulting, strong signings in consulting. But we did see a pullback in the latter part of March, particularly in many European countries around project base, transformational base activity in next generation applications like S/4HANA, Oracle, Workday and other people are delaying, and we expect that to continue here in the second quarter.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Matt. Sheila, can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nKaty Huberty: I wonder, if you could start out by just commenting on what the one or two metrics are that you would like us to measure you and your team on over the next couple of years? And then, I wanted to follow up and ask, either you or Jim can comment. You talked about scenario like a range of scenarios for this year. Obviously, the most bearish would be social distancing through the remainder of the calendar year and the most optimistic would be a [Technical Difficulty]. What does that translate to in terms of sort of the bearish scenario and EPS and free cash flow, and more optimistic scenario, just any color as to how wide that range may look like? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: So, let me start. You said what KPIs or what metrics should you use? Look, I think, I\u2019ve been clear, we should look at growth as the metric, albeit once we begin to emerge from the pandemic. And it\u2019s impossible for me to predict how long this is going to be. You mentioned two scenarios, but I\u2019ve listened to all of you and your peers, and I don\u2019t have any particular crystal ball on this. The estimates are all over the place on both the depth and the length of the impact.Now, the other one that I think you should hold us to in metric, other than revenue or a pure financial metric is the number of clients on which we are engaged on hybrid cloud engagement. We talk about it from a product perspective, we talk about 2,200 clients to date. But as we begin to wrap those also with services engagement, I think that\u2019s the second metric that is effectively a leading indicator towards the overall revenue metrics, because that\u2019s the precondition for that. And that\u2019s where we are driving the entire company to. That\u2019s what I\u2019m focused on. I run a war room on that every week. And that\u2019s what our sales forces are incented to go get done. So, Jim, I don\u2019t know whether you want to add something. We already answered the question I think.\nJim Kavanaugh: Those are the two that align to our business model. But to your second question, Katy, I\u2019m not going to talk to specificity around there. As I said in the prepared remarks, we have done a tremendous amount of work on stress testing, running these are scenarios. There\u2019s a wide range of outcomes. The key here for investors I think are two questions. One, in any of those scenarios, do you still have the strength of your cash, your liquidity position to ensure that you can, one, invest in your business to make sure as you come out of this you can emerge stronger, and two, can you maintain your capital allocation and your commitment to our investors and with regards to the dividend, and both of those emphatically, yes.The second question is around each of these scenarios, how are we actually managing our businesses across the board? And I would tell you, if you break this into a product based business and a services based business starting with services, it is the safety around having an annuitized based model. GBS entering a quarter is about 80%, GTS is about 95% plus that does come down as quarters and plus 1 and plus 2 and plus 3 go out, but it provides us a very solid base to work with as far as stability that drives that profit that cash and that flexibility. But what are we looking at and how we manage a services business right now is we\u2019re -- Arvind and I are looking at daily is one, what\u2019s happening to the rate and consumption of our backlog, what are clients doing around projects, around offerings, what\u2019s happening to our utilization, our chargeable billable rates, our price realization. Each of those are fundamental KPIs that we\u2019re looking at in this environment right now, to the health of the indicator around a services based business.Around a product based business, much more transactional. As Arvind said, software is about 20% to 25% transactional, here in the second quarter, has a strong annuity base. By the way Red Hat, subscription based model, strong annuity base. But the dynamics are how we\u2019re managing that are looking at our pipeline, our volume, our deal sizes, our yields, our progression, our renewal rates, our demand capacity for our hardware products, and where they\u2019re at within their cycle. So, we are driving the operational discipline you would expect in this Company as we move forward. But at the end, we have enough of that financial flexibility and cash flow liquidity, which I think is the most important message for the investor.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Katy. Can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan. You may go ahead.\nTien-tsin Huang: I wanted to ask just a quick one, acquisitions for you, Arvind, just looking beyond the pandemic, I know that\u2019s hard to do. But criteria, size, thinking on accretion, dilution you\u2019re willing to accept there, as you want to move quicker to hybrid cloud and AI? Can you share your thoughts on that? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: So, you asked about criteria, size, accretion, and the thing. Look, I think, on all three, one that is easiest, size. Size is not a criterion. So, I\u2019m just going to put that to the side. As Jim said a couple of times, we have enough fin flex to do a fair number of things and most things that we might, I think are possible for us to be able to get done. So, I\u2019ll put size aside and say that\u2019s not really an issue.You asked about accretion and decretion. Jim and I are clear. We manage the business for the long term. So, if it becomes accretive, often a year or two, as we described about Red Hat, that\u2019s more than sufficient for us. It doesn\u2019t have to be accretive on month one or day one. As long as it\u2019s a healthy business, provides us the kind of growth profile, and provides us the ability to get sufficient synergy, both for IBM and for the property itself. Both have to be winners. It cannot just be one of us. Otherwise, it\u2019s not that attractive.And then, you said about criteria. The criteria is, those things that make our clients value us even higher, and the areas we have chosen to be their trusted partner on is hybrid cloud and AI. So, that\u2019s sort of the criteria.But, please take a wide stance on hybrid clouds. Hybrid cloud encompasses how we connect private and public, it connects -- it includes how we might secure them, if might include the data that is inside those properties, provides more visibility. And as we shift that out over time, that will widen even more, because the definition of what is the cloud market, also tends to change over time. So hopefully that answered your question, but it\u2019s something we give a lot of thought to.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Tien-tsin. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please, Sheila.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thanks. Arvind, congratulations. Nice to have you on the call. This is I guess for both of you. Are there any components of the business that are in transition, whether that\u2019s GTS or certain legacy software segments where the current pandemic creates an opportunity to accelerate that transformation? And perhaps you can tie that into the comments I think in your prepared remarks that telegraph that there may be some additional rebalancing actions in the June quarter?\nArvind Krishna: I think, David, we are always looking at this and always looking at portfolio optimization. I would not say because of the pandemic or COVID-19 would we look at this. As you saw last year, we divested in the software portfolio quite a few things that were core to hybrid cloud. They were around marketing properties and as service properties around many of our retail clients. It didn\u2019t really necessarily fit or pull along or had synergy with the core hybrid cloud portfolio. So, it made sense to divest them. I think, we\u2019re done with that round, just to be upfront.Now, as we always look and say, does this or does this not bring value? Is there a reason for our client to have both, the core hybrid cloud portfolio and something? We\u2019re going to reevaluate that all the time, but I don\u2019t have something to name for you that we are trying to do right now. As the quarters go along, as the months go along, we will do it. But I also want to be clear that for the next few months, we have to be focused on the stability of the business. And we have to be focused on making sure that we preserve our liquidity and our balance sheet. So, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve kind of focused on for the very near term.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay, Thanks, David. Sheila, let\u2019s take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Thank you very much. Arvind, congratulations on your promotion as well as Jim Whitehurst, congratulations on your promotion as well. I wanted to ask a little higher level question. As I think about IBM, there is many constituents, but probably three broad ones, shareholders, employees and then customers. And as you think about the stock performance over the last, I don\u2019t know, five to seven years, I think shareholders would conclude that they\u2019ve been disappointed with IBM\u2019s performance. And even from a customer perspective, if you look at IBM\u2019s revenues relative to growth of the many markets who participate in, probably some disappointment there. So, as you think about your new leadership and perhaps focusing, excuse me, on the investor side, what do you think you really need to do differently for IBM and its shareholders versus what\u2019s happened over the last five to seven years? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Look, I think that -- I think, we had acknowledged the market value growth of other things. So, while we have always selected on high value, and to your point on clients, we measure our net promoter score or NPS, which I think is widely regarded as being one of the best metrics of how clients value what they\u2019re getting from you. And that has actually improved substantially, I think over 10 points if I remember over the last two years. So, given that the NPS is improving, our clients are much more delighted with what they get from us. Now, that said, the overall portfolio has to be able to grow to return -- to make investors happier. And that\u2019s why we are clear. You noticed me announce a lot of our management team at the beginning. I think this is a team that\u2019s going to be able to deliver growth back to the market.So, Jim Kavanaugh of course, as you heard him talk about capital allocation and how he\u2019s going to use that fin flex to enable both organic and inorganic investment. Jim Whitehurst who many of you know well who has dealt really well both the crises when he was at Delta and then growth, when he was at Red Hat. Bridget van Kralingen, who has a strong record of understanding client needs and is going to draw some of the go-to-market changes we mentioned. Howard Boville that we\u2019re bringing in who was at Bank of America who has a deep empathy and understanding for some of our largest clients, but also who drove a lot of efficiency when he was at the Bank. And he can bring those attributes to the clients as well. And Mark Foster who has Services and who has a real intention for growth and for making sure that he brings value to our clients and services.We put all that together. And I think it is a team that can go deliver growth. But let\u2019s also be clear. We can talk about what is important, is it growth or is it only EPS or is it only liquidity? Look, liquidity is essential, without that no company is going to survive through the next period, and I don\u2019t know how long the period is going to be. So, I think our obsession with that is going to serve us well in this period. But, what are you hearing me say is that growth has to be an equal obsession to other metrics that are there, so we are going to go do that.So, may not be a completely full answer, Keith, but we\u2019ll probably get there as the months go on and we get more clarity.So, I think, that was the last question, if I remember. So, let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. These are truly unprecedented times. Over the coming weeks and months, we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our employees, our clients, and how we can help broader society. As difficult as this crisis is, it presents an opportunity for IBM as a technology leader and as a trusted partner.Personally, it\u2019s an interesting and exciting time to be taking on this role. I look forward to continuing this dialog with all of you and will update you at the end of the second quarter. Thank you.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thanks Arvind, thanks Jim. Thanks for all of your questions. Sheila, let me turn it back to you to wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Arvind. I want to start out by expressing my sympathy to all those who have been impacted by this health crisis and deep gratitude to the incredible people who have been helping IBM, our clients and the world to deal with this crisis, especially those on the frontline.Now, turning to our first quarter. We delivered $17.6 billion of revenue with modest growth net of currency and divestitures. We had good gross margin expansion, operating earnings per share of $1.84 and continued solid free cash flow.Before I get into the specifics of the quarter, in light of the current environment, I want to take a step back and provide some perspective on a few areas. First, on our client base, our portfolio and our financial profile, which you'll see provides some stability to our business; second, what we saw at the end of the quarter; and then finally, add on to Arvind's comments on what we're doing with our own business to address the current environment.IBM has always focused on the enterprise space and within that, our business is more concentrated in large enterprises. For decades, we have run our client's most critical processes, like core banking systems, supply chains, and claims processing. From an industry perspective, the majority of our revenue comes from clients in financial services, telecom and the public sector, including government and healthcare. We have long-term relationships with these clients in the form of multiyear services contracts, recurring software streams and financing arrangements.As a result, when you look at our business mix, about 60% of our annual revenue is in recurring businesses. While we're not immune in this environment to disruptions in the transactional content and volume reductions, our client profile and annuity base provides some level of stability, not only in our revenue, but also in profit and cash as we manage through these challenging times.Looking at the first quarter, through February, we were tracking roughly in line with our expectations. As we got into March, the health situation and resulting social distancing became more widespread. As you would expect, we saw a noticeable change in client priorities. With that, there was effectively a pause as clients understandably dealt with their most pressing needs. This was most pronounced in our software business, where the vast majority of transactions typically closed in the last two weeks of the quarter. For those clients that did engage at the end of the quarter, there was a noticeable change in priorities where focus very quickly shifted to the stability of their operations and preservation of cash. They moved ahead with spending that addressed immediate and essential needs, including running mission-critical processes and securing a remote workforce.For example, we increased infrastructure capacity and services to meet unprecedented demands on critical banking functions for banks in countries ranging from Italy and Spain to the United States, to Australia and Singapore. In Brazil, we developed a platform and a single week to connect patients to doctors via telemedicine. And at a major U.S. insurance company, we helped 40,000 employees to work remote, when they had absolutely no work-at-home capabilities just two weeks earlier. At the same time, the last few weeks have only reinforced the need for clients to modernize their businesses for the new world, and cloud and AI are at the core of their digital reinventions.With our hybrid cloud and AI platforms, together with our expertise in running critical processes, we're ideally positioned to guide clients on their journeys. Anthem is a great example of a company accelerating their digital reinvention in today's COVID-19 environment. We're helping them to operate with more agility and provide greater quality of service, by leveraging data and deep insights to enhance the experience of their 41 million members. We are doing this on a secure, open platform run on Red Hat and the IBM Cloud.Now in parallel, we've taken actions within our own business to help IBM better operate in this environment and emerge stronger. For example, we are aligning investments to the key offering areas Arvind mentioned. We took structural actions to improve the competitiveness of our Global Technology Services business, and enable new ways of working across our operations. Our actions will deliver annualized gross savings of nearly $2 billion.We are accelerating our own digital transformation from demand generation to further ramping up our digital sales capability. And in our supply chain, we are leveraging AI, blockchain and IoT technologies to drive faster and smarter decisions with our suppliers. We also enhanced health and safety measures at our sites to maintain our manufacturing operations at required capacity to meet our customers' needs. This caps off a lot of work over the last few years to make our supply chain more flexible and resilient.While we're supporting our clients and improving the flexibility and competitive position of our operations, we are also taking actions to enhance IBM's balance sheet strength and liquidity position. We accessed the debt market in early February, with a $4 billion issuance, while reducing $4.5 billion of current and 2021 refinancing needs. In addition, while we do not rely on commercial paper for our funding needs, we thought it was prudent to take advantage of our access to the CP market. We ended the quarter with $2.5 billion of commercial paper, which increased both our debt and cash balances. As a result, we ended March with a cash balance of $12 billion, which is up $3 billion from year-end. Our total debt of $64 billion includes $22 billion of global financing debt, which is in support of IBM products and services, and has a stable credit portfolio.Finally, as we discussed in January, our pension plans were well funded at the end of 2019, with worldwide qualified plans funded at 102%. While we typically don't provide a status during the year, I can say that our overall pension funded status in March was fairly consistent with year-end, and we do not see a change to our expected plan contributions in 2020.Bottom line, we have a strong cash position and ample credit available during these uncertain times to support and invest in the business. We'll continue to be opportunistic in the capital markets, while remaining fully committed to our mid-to-high single A credit rating and our targeted leverage ratio. I'll remind you we also have over $15 billion of unused credit facilities. And while we have no plans to draw on the facilities, they are available as backup liquidity, and our debt covenants are well within the required levels. And with our share repurchase program suspended since the Red Hat acquisition, our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our dividend.So, with that as a backdrop, let me focus on few highlights in the quarter, before getting into the segments. We had strong cloud performance again this quarter, with cloud revenue up 23%. By bringing together our technology and expertise to help our clients accelerate their journeys to cloud, our cloud revenue has grown to $22 billion over the last 12 months.Arvind talked about the winning cloud architecture of Linux, Containers and Kubernetes, and the acquisition and integration of Red Hat bolsters our position in hybrid cloud. Red Hat momentum continued this quarter, with normalized revenue growth of 20%, and strong bookings and backlog growth. RHEL has proved to be mission-critical for many customers, particularly in this environment, and Infrastructure revenue was again up double-digits. Application Development and emerging technologies was up nearly 40% this quarter, driven by OpenShift and Ansible.The number of Red Hat large deals was up from the fourth quarter, and up about 50% over last year. Red Hat signed the two largest deals in its history, leveraging IBM's deep client relationships. This is a great proof point of the value of IBM and Red Hat together. We see it in the larger Red Hat deals, in the pipeline of IBM services engagements based on Red Hat's technologies, and in the number of clients now using Red Hat and IBM's container solutions. This has grown to over 2,200, as Red Hat and IBM have emerged as the leading container platform.The contribution of Red Hat, together with strong margin performance in our services businesses contributed to our 150 basis points of operating gross margin expansion. Our pre-tax income reflects charges of nearly $900 million primarily for the structural actions to improve our competitiveness in GTS, and accelerate our shift to a cognitive enterprise. The charges for these actions were more than offset by non-cash discrete tax benefits.You'll recall I mentioned both the structural actions and the discrete tax benefits back on our call in January, and so these had been planned for some time. Our cash and balance sheet strength are fueled by healthy free cash flow. This quarter we generated $2.1 billion of cash from operations, and $1.4 billion of free cash flow, both excluding our financing receivables. There is a lot of seasonality in our free cash flow, and over the last year we generated $11.6 billion, which is about 125% of GAAP net income.And a final comment on Red Hat's contribution to our free cash flow. When we closed Red Hat back in July, we expected Red Hat, net of interest expense, to be accretive to free cash flow by the end of the first year. With Red Hat's strong performance, after three quarters, we've now achieved that milestone.Now, let me turn to the segment results, starting with Cloud & Cognitive Software, which grew 7% this quarter. We had strong performance in Red Hat, IoT and Data & AI, and in our security services. Just as I did for overall IBM, I'll start with a view of software dynamics as we moved through the quarter.We entered the year with a robust offering portfolio and solid pipeline, and we had double-digit revenue growth through February. In March, our software transactions stalled nearly overnight, as our clients shifted their focus to resiliency efforts. We saw those dynamics play out most notably in Cognitive Applications, where many transformational deals were paused, especially in the retail industry. And in Transaction Processing Platforms, given cash concerns, clients traded off CapEx for OpEx. These are typically large engagements, and in this environment, clients elected to defer purchases, impacting perpetual license sales late in the quarter. More than offsetting that, we continue to have good growth in Cloud and Data Platforms, led by Red Hat and the synergies we're realizing by bringing together Red Hat and IBM software.Given the shifting software demands we've seen in some parts of the business, we are focused on a number of initiatives heading into the second quarter. We're doubling down on areas that facilitate the shift to cloud, including Red Hat and other cloud and data platform offerings, Cloud Paks for operational efficiency and QRadar on Cloud for security threats. Our go-to-market teams are accelerating their shifts to digital channels. And we're now leveraging our partner ecosystem to expand our reach into critical industries and markets.To sum it up, our portfolio in Cloud & Cognitive Software is aligned to the hybrid cloud and AI opportunity. We've modernized our software to be cloud native and optimized on OpenShift, which provides a compelling hybrid cloud platform for clients on their digital journeys to cloud. While we expect near-term pressure on transactions, we continue to invest in new development and innovation for our hybrid cloud and AI strategy.Turning to Global Business Services. We entered the year with good momentum in revenue, gross profit and signings, and our backlog returned to growth. This growing backlog and the revenue we expected to yield from it, gave us confidence that GBS revenue performance would accelerate as the year progressed. We had solid performance in GBS in the first quarter, with revenue growth of 1%, and gross profit margin expansion of 100 basis points.Our Consulting revenue grew 5%, led by offerings that help clients with their digital reinventions such as cloud advisory and application modernization, and offerings that leverage AI to inject intelligence into business processes. These offerings enable clients to reengineer their business processes and IT environments for speed, flexibility, and efficiency to better serve their end-users. We have standardized our cloud application modernization offerings on OpenShift, and built the world's largest Red Hat consulting practice. We are now working with over 100 clients on Red Hat technologies, such as Anthem, Procter & Gamble, USAA, Santander, and Horizon Healthcare, just to name a few.In the first quarter we also had good growth in many of the transformational offerings like next-generation enterprise applications. But as the impact of COVID-19 intensified in March, clients began to deprioritize some of these projects. In this environment, we are aligning our go-to-market and delivery resources to the near-term opportunity, addressing challenges like engaging customers virtually, modernizing and migrating applications to the cloud, empowering a remote workforce, and cybersecurity and IT resiliency.Internally, we have shifted from a predominantly face-to-face engagement model to a virtual one, now with almost 100 percent of our GBS delivery resources not only working remotely, but productively working to support our clients.Over the last few weeks we've gotten questions from investors on our ability to support clients given the shutdown in some countries. I can tell you that in India, we had over 98% of our practitioners working remotely within 48 hours of lockdown. As we look forward, we have a solid base of business and a growing backlog, though in the near term, we expect customers to continue to delay and replan some projects. We are going to continue to prudently manage the business by leveraging our variable and global delivery resource model, to ensure utilization is balanced with the rate and pace of backlog consumption and new deals. And we're going to continue to build skills and practices, so that as the demand returns to more normal levels, we're ready to address it.Turning to Global Technology Services. Our revenue decline of 4% was fairly consistent with last quarter's performance, and we expanded gross profit margin by 30 basis points. As I've said in the past, we are managing this business for margin and cash contribution.Last quarter, I talked about the actions to accelerate the shift to higher value segments of the market and improve our cost competitiveness. So, let me start with a quick update on our progress.A significant portion of the first quarter's structural actions addressed GTS. This improves our position for the future but impacted our PTI in the first quarter. In this dynamic environment, we are going to continue to evaluate the cost competitiveness of this portfolio, and we'll take further actions as required. We also advanced our joint offerings and go-to-market capabilities with GBS. As clients shift their mission-critical workloads to the cloud, they are looking for integration across the application and infrastructure stack.By more tightly integrating GBS and GTS, we're providing a differentiated solution. While we are in the initial stages of this work, we see some early indications of progress in our signings this quarter. Both total signings, and our cloud signings grew at a double-digit rate. This includes significant engagements at Caixabank and Anthem. Strong signings contributed to an improved total Services backlog, which is now roughly flat year-to-year. Within that, cloud now represents over 40% of our outsourcing backlog. This fuels our GTS cloud revenue, which was up 12% this quarter.In the current environment, enterprises are focused on infrastructure solutions, which enhance IT resiliency and business continuity, address new cybersecurity risks, and reconfigure their IT environments for cost efficiency and business agility. We are prioritizing our resources and our management system to these opportunities, focusing on offerings like unified communications, business continuity and resiliency, workplace virtualization and enabling remote working. At the same time, we are adopting alternative delivery models as we continue to support mission-critical workloads without service interruption. In fact, almost 100% of our employees in our GTS global delivery centers are now working remotely.While in this environment we expect to have some impact due to lower business volumes, this will ultimately lead to an acceleration in the shift of mission-critical workloads to the cloud. And as I've said, this will be a hybrid multi-cloud environment, built on open standards. IBM Services will leverage our incumbency, our industry, regulatory and business process expertise and of course Red Hat to capture this opportunity.And so now looking at Systems, revenue was up 4% this quarter, and gross margin expanded over 400 basis points. In an environment where client behavior shifted at the end of the quarter, our hardware portfolio held up well. This reflects the importance of IBM Z and high-end storage for mission-critical operations, as well as product cycle dynamics. These are high-end systems, and client value in this segment is driven by new innovation. We see that in the z15 mainframe. And we see it in Storage, with the high-end DS8900 introduced at the end of 2019, and more recently, a new and simplified distributed storage portfolio, which supports hybrid multi-cloud deployments.In the second full quarter of availability, the z15 proved to be a crucial backbone of enterprise operations, providing a stable, secure, and scalable platform. Our financial services clients were able to scale up their capacity to meet the significant demands from unprecedented spikes in market volatility without touching their physical infrastructure. And in high-end storage, which is tightly integrated with the mainframe, we had a good quarter, especially in support of mission-critical banking workloads.The growth in Z and storage was partly offset by a decline in Power. This reflects where we are in our product cycle, as well as the fact that Power is more skewed to smaller enterprises, which were more impacted by the dynamics in March. We're continuing to adapt our operations to meet the needs of clients most effectively, especially in this changing environment. We're expanding the digital sales channel for both the Storage and Power business. And we're leveraging technology to proactively manage our globally diversified supply chain.Now after going through the segments, I want to bring it back up to the IBM level and talk about what this means going forward. First and foremost, we have confidence in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Nothing we've seen over the last two months causes us to waiver from these priorities. In fact, as Arvind said upfront, we believe the challenges clients are facing today will speed their transitions to digital. That bodes well for us. But there is obviously some dislocation in the near term.In this environment, we've taken quick and prudent actions to manage our cost and expense, further improve our liquidity position, and focus on opportunities to emerge stronger. Since the crisis began, we've been stress testing our model, and running a number of scenarios based on various assumptions.Given the level of uncertainty around the duration of the health crisis, and the rate and pace of economic recovery, there is a wide range of outcomes for the year, which we are prepared for. But to assign probabilities to the assumptions during these unprecedented times just isn't valuable. As a result, it is prudent to withdraw our expectations for full year 2020, and we will reassess at the end of the second quarter. Though to be clear, under the various scenarios we ran, we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to support our business and secure our dividend.Before turning back to Arvind, I want to provide some perspective on how we're entering the second quarter. Over the last few years, our software transactional content in the second quarter is about 20% to 25% of our software revenue. We have a solid pipeline of deals, but in the end, our software performance will depend on how we yield against that pipeline. If we continue to see the same client buying behavior, it's reasonable to expect the second quarter will be more challenging.Systems hardware is essentially all transactional. Here too, we have a good pipeline in IBM Z and storage. While the current environment is expected to impact closure rates, I would expect less of an impact to Z and storage, given the essential nature of the purchases and the additional capacity requirements, especially in certain industries.In services, we've made real progress in the backlog, and for the first time in a while, we ended the quarter with services backlog essentially flat versus last year, that's with GBS up and GTS down modestly. About 80% of the GBS revenue and 90% of the GTS revenue in a quarter has historically come from the opening backlog, though our contracts adjust for flexible volumes in our clients' businesses. As mentioned earlier, close to 100% of our people in our service delivery centers are working remotely.Looking at our cost and expense, we're closely managing our spending and capitalizing on new and efficient ways of operating. The savings from structural actions will start to yield in the second half. We are likely to take additional actions in the second quarter. I'll remind you that we are well positioned from a liquidity perspective and remain focused on driving our free cash flow including robust working capital management.For years, we've been talking about our high-value portfolio and business model, and in times like these that really matters. This is why our liquidity position is naturally strong, and our pension plan is well funded coming into this environment. So, we're prepared for this environment, have a strong financial position, and compelling value propositions for clients, but our near-term performance will ultimately be influenced by client buying patterns in this economic environment.Arvind, I'll turn it back over to you. Yes. The only thing I would add to Arvind is our capital allocation strategy obviously is there to support the business design and the business and portfolio strategy that we have chosen. To your point around hybrid cloud, data AI, we've got enough fire power with regards to a strong balance sheet, solid free cash flow generation, solid investment grade, a good access to market, which we talked about in the prepared remarks that gives us ample free cash flow and flexibility to invest in our business, while also returning value to our shareholder in securing that dividend that we talked about upfront. And that acquisition component is a very big important part of our capital allocation strategy, and that hasn't changed. Yes. Hello, Wamsi. Thanks for the question, because this is important. As you can imagine, given the unfortunate and unprecedented situation everyone around the world is dealing with right here with COVID-19, we've been spending a lot of time on our business profile, our business model, stress testing it, running multiple scenarios, as I said in the prepared remarks. But, when you look at it, it's always been done around one, the long-term sustainability of the IBM Company to deliver value for our clients and for our investors. And that means you've got to have a strong balance sheet, you've got to have ample liquidity that gives you flexibility to continue to invest, so that we emerge stronger as we get through this pandemic, when we move forward. And that really -- simplistically, if you take a step back, it's two levers. One is on the top-line in revenue and the others on the fundamentals of your operating leverage in the business. Both of those deliver that free cash flow in that cash. And in that latter part, I would put in there optimization of your balance sheet.And we've looked at our revenue portfolio, as we talked about in our prepared remarks. We believe we are differentiated, although we're not immune from what's happening in the marketplace. We do have some level of stability in our revenue, our profit, our cash, and that's driven by all of the work that we've done over time to transform this Company, transform and optimize our portfolio. We went from -- in 2008, at the last recession, we were only about 45%, 47% annuity. We are now north of 60%. We have always been focused on large enterprise versus consumer SMB, and that is playing out well.Our industry concentration, as I said on the prepared remarks, over 70% of our revenue sits in industries based on IDC and Gartner that are going to be either moderately or minimally impacted by COVID-19. So, we are diversified along geographic dimensions, market dimensions, industry dimensions, client dimensions that gives us that strong annuity content to move forward.And then on the margin and balance sheet, we're going to optimize as we've always done, the portfolio shift in the higher value, the structural actions we just got done here in the first quarter, $900 million that impacted our PTI in the first quarter. That by the way will give us a annualized return of over 2x. And we'll keep watching our credit portfolio and the quality, our deferred revenue, and also our DPO and DSO which is in very good shape. So, net of that is, we feel confident around ample financial flexibility, ample liquidity to continue to invest in our business as we move forward and secure that dividend. Yes. Toni, thank you very much for the question, because operating leverage is obviously one of the core fundamental pillars of our high value based thesis and high value based business model overall. But, let me just cut to the chase with regards to your question overall. You asked about it from a pretax income, I'll take it down to an EPS level, which was similar to net income. We were down 18% overall. That EPS was down $0.41 year-to-year. Yes, it includes the $900 million worth of restructuring and the structural charges also includes as we guided back in January, a discrete tax event. But, the thing that you're missing in that equation is all of the Red Hat integration and non-cash related purchase accounting implications that are in our EPS and in our profit number.Now, as we close that transaction -- by the way, less than three quarters ago, and we feel very confident about the health and the profile of our Red Hat business overall. We took a substantial write-down with regards to that deferred revenue, $2.2 billion overall. And we talked about Red Hat being free cash flow accretive year one and being operating EPS accretive at the end of year two.We already hit the milestone on the first metric and we're well on our way delivering the progress on the second metric. And just to bring this all home, the EPS of a $1.84, down $0.41 year-over-year. About $0.35 to $0.38 of that $0.41 is the Red Hat, non-cash deferred revenue and integration. Why do I bring that up? Because as we said, that will diminish over time. And as we continue to replenish the backlog, which we are and we'll talk about, and we wrap around those expenses, that's where you're going to get even more substantial operating leverage going forward in the future. Yes. Matt, thank you very much for the question. So, Arvind kind of gave a perspective of what we're seeing here for the first couple of weeks. And as you stated, just given the one transactional versus annuity nature, second quarter like fourth quarter is our highest transactional quarter, particularly in our software base of business overall. But, let me give you a little perspective around the month of March versus February quarter-to-date, because I think it's important for investors to understand the value of our high value based business model and integrated business model. Because the unfortunate COVID-19 situation that's impacting economies around the world, has a very different profile across our business, whether it's hardware, software and services. And as we've seen coming through February, the IBM Company was growing revenue through February, led by strong double-digit growth in software overall. The month of March, as I said in the prepared remarks, as the healthcare crisis intensified, that's where we saw the fundamental shift in client buying behavior, appropriately, so by the way as we've done in IBM, where first and foremost you wanted to focus on the operational stability and business continuity of your enterprise and second around the preservation of cash. But, when you look at it, it was more pronounced in our software and our GBS business.We actually substantially grew in the month of March in our hardware portfolio. But, I would align that more around bringing new innovation to market. We're in this cycle of mainframe and we did very well with the attach of storage overall. And our GTS business, remember, is a strong annuity base and it's running mission critical work and our outsourcing IS business actually got better by 1 point quarter-to-quarter. So, that's pretty stable. But within GBS and software, interesting around software, our cloud and data platform, 34% growth, yes, driven by Red Hat, but even on a normalized organic basis, we grew over 3%. And that's really the instantiation of our hybrid cloud thesis with Red Hat overall. So, that part of the portfolio is still executing well. And I think that's part of what Arvind said, clients are now even faster, more accelerating their journeys to cloud. And it plays right to that.Now, where we got hit was in Cognitive Applications and in Transaction Processing Platform, two different phenomenons across that portfolio. Our Cog Apps is much more centered around industry related content where industries that are getting more impacted disproportionately, like retail, like industrial, like automotive. And in TPP that was a function of just the preservation of cash shifting away from CapEx and OpEx. And just concluding GBS, although we're very pleased, remember 90 days ago, we talked about accelerating momentum in GBS. We turned that business back to backlog growth. We actually delivered growth in the quarter, strong growth in consulting, strong signings in consulting. But we did see a pullback in the latter part of March, particularly in many European countries around project base, transformational base activity in next generation applications like S/4HANA, Oracle, Workday and other people are delaying, and we expect that to continue here in the second quarter. Those are the two that align to our business model. But to your second question, Katy, I'm not going to talk to specificity around there. As I said in the prepared remarks, we have done a tremendous amount of work on stress testing, running these are scenarios. There's a wide range of outcomes. The key here for investors I think are two questions. One, in any of those scenarios, do you still have the strength of your cash, your liquidity position to ensure that you can, one, invest in your business to make sure as you come out of this you can emerge stronger, and two, can you maintain your capital allocation and your commitment to our investors and with regards to the dividend, and both of those emphatically, yes.The second question is around each of these scenarios, how are we actually managing our businesses across the board? And I would tell you, if you break this into a product based business and a services based business starting with services, it is the safety around having an annuitized based model. GBS entering a quarter is about 80%, GTS is about 95% plus that does come down as quarters and plus 1 and plus 2 and plus 3 go out, but it provides us a very solid base to work with as far as stability that drives that profit that cash and that flexibility. But what are we looking at and how we manage a services business right now is we're -- Arvind and I are looking at daily is one, what's happening to the rate and consumption of our backlog, what are clients doing around projects, around offerings, what's happening to our utilization, our chargeable billable rates, our price realization. Each of those are fundamental KPIs that we're looking at in this environment right now, to the health of the indicator around a services based business.Around a product based business, much more transactional. As Arvind said, software is about 20% to 25% transactional, here in the second quarter, has a strong annuity base. By the way Red Hat, subscription based model, strong annuity base. But the dynamics are how we're managing that are looking at our pipeline, our volume, our deal sizes, our yields, our progression, our renewal rates, our demand capacity for our hardware products, and where they're at within their cycle. So, we are driving the operational discipline you would expect in this Company as we move forward. But at the end, we have enough of that financial flexibility and cash flow liquidity, which I think is the most important message for the investor."

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. As you all know, we are in the midst of an unprecedented global public health crisis. I'd like to pause for a moment and say that my heart goes out to all those dealing with COVID-19. One of the first commitments I made was to be transparent and open, not just with our employees and our clients and partners, but with our investment community as well. In that spirit, I will participate, not just today, but in earnings calls from now on. There are a few topics I'd like to cover with you today. First, I'll revisit areas I've talked about; second, I'll tell you about what we have accomplished in the last two weeks; and finally, I'll tell you about areas I intend to focus on in the near future; and then, I'll quickly touch upon our Q1 results.Let's start with the areas I've talked about. I have told our team, it is essential that we deepen our understanding of our clients' journey to hybrid cloud and AI, which will result in hybrid cloud as the fourth platform. We remain obsessed with continually delighting clients. And we further established IBM as the gold standard for good tech. All these are underpinned by our culture that fosters growth and an entrepreneurial mindset. I see these as our collective priorities. I'll move on to what's been done in the last few weeks.Despite the challenges we're facing as a result of a global crisis, we've remained steadfast in our commitment to employees, clients, and society at large. More than 95% of our 350,000 IBMers are working remotely now. In addition, about 8,000 of them remain at essential sites to carry out mission-critical work. As our clients adjust to this new normal, they need a partner they can trust. IBM is that partner. This isn't just about helping our clients navigate the crisis, but to ensure that that they emerge stronger and more resilient. To that end, we have taken concrete steps to bundle existing offerings to address the shifting needs of clients, such as leveraging hybrid cloud, using AI for automation, and enabling remote work.Another area we've been focusing on has been to mobilize IBM and IBMers to help with the global battle against COVID-19. Here are some examples: The computing power, over 360 petaflops that we have helped convene for researchers; the weather channel, COVID-19 county by county map, which saw more than 40 million visits in the first week of launch; the AI assistants that can answer citizens' questions about COVID-19, 21 of them live today, and nearly 90 being rolled out; and educational resources available to anyone anywhere. We're doing great work, helping the city of New York and are delivering 300,000 tablets with educational software and free cellular data connections that can help students learn remotely.When we add this all up, we have done the math. In just a few weeks we have already committed over $200 million in terms of contributions and volunteer time. I'm extremely proud of IBM's response to COVID-19.Now, I want to tell you about some areas of focus for the near future. I want to be clear. The ultimate outcome that I am absolutely committed to is growth for our Company as we emerge from the pandemic. A key area of focus is to ensure that IBM leads in the two major transformational journeys our clients are on, cloud and AI. IBM has already built three enduring platforms, mainframe, services and middleware. The fourth one is hybrid cloud. Clients however need more than a platform. They need a deep industry expertise. This is why the services that clients rely on to build and manage the hybrid cloud platform, is a massive opportunity for IBM. It's nearly half of the $1.2 trillion hybrid cloud opportunity.IBM, together with Red Hat, have unique sources of competitive advantage we can leverage to win the architectural battle for cloud. There's our open source and security leadership, our deep expertise and trust, but also the fact that we give clients that unique ability to build mission critical applications once and run them anywhere. Together with Red Hat, we are establishing Linux, Containers and Kubernetes as the new standard. This is winning the architectural battle for hybrid cloud.Let's talk a little bit on how we take this to clients. I want IBMers to lead with a more technical approach. I want our teams to showcase the value of our solution as early as possible. Likewise, there must be a relentless focus on quality. Our products must speak for themselves in terms of user experience, design and ease of use.My approach is straight forward. I am going to focus on growing the value of the Company. This includes better aligning our portfolio around hybrid cloud and AI to meet the evolving needs of the market. We will continue investing including acquisitions. As you have seen, we have divested parts of software and services that did not align with our focus areas. This will continue.The past few weeks have catapulted us into the world of virtual selling and remote delivery. These entail new ways of working. This is a reminder we should always be asking ourselves, is there a better way to do this? If you don't question why you're doing things, you'll never evolve into something better. What's clear is our confidence in our strategy and our portfolio, which is focused on hybrid cloud and AI.Before turning to Jim, I want to comment on our results. In the first quarter, we had modest revenue growth. That's net of currency and divestitures. We entered the quarter in a good position with momentum from the end of last year. However, in the last few weeks we faced a shift in client priorities, towards the preservation of capital. This impacted software disproportionately, and Jim will comment more on this later. Other parts of our business maintained modest momentum. We are entering this challenging environment from a relative position of strength. Our clients are enterprises that run the most essential processes of the world. Our balance sheet is strong, and Jim is going to take you through that.I believe that what we are going through today with the shift to remote work, automation, application modernization will accelerate our clients' shift to hybrid cloud. This gives me immense confidence in our future.So, I will turn it over to Jim to take you through the quarter and then will come back at the end for Q&A. Thank you, Jim.We have taken the importance of transparency seriously, and so it was a tough decision to withdraw guidance. But these are unprecedented times, and this quarter is not the time to declare that we have clarity, that does not benefit us, and it does not benefit you as investors and analysts.With better clarity on the economic recovery, we will provide an update at the end of the second quarter. But please know there's a difference between the ability to accurately predict a near-term revenue or earnings per share number, and confidence in our business over the longer term. And I have confidence in our business. Under different scenarios, we have ample free cash flow and liquidity to support the business and secure our dividend. We are entering this environment from a position of strength.So, over to Patricia for the Q&A. Okay. Thanks, Amit. Let me start with talking about the portfolio and your questions on investment.So, look, obviously the portfolio is something I evaluate deeply. We do it all the time and continuously. But, I do want to caution that in the immediate period, which is right now, we got to focus and put our priority on supporting our employees and clients. Now, investment to us encompasses both, encompasses both organic investments and inorganic, or acquisitions. We've been clear that we will acquire when we find properties that are both attractive or that fit our strategy. And hybrid cloud and AI are the focus of our business going forward. But, when we talk about hybrid cloud, it is an all-in. And I'll just give a quick reflection on Red Hat. We had Linux as the core, you had OpenShift surrounding it. We put all of our middleware on OpenShift. We have hundreds of GBS projects already leveraging both the Cloud Paks and OpenShift to make application modernization. And then eventually we'll find services also running those modernized applications for our clients.You'll find there are many, many properties in that -- in my broader definition of hybrid cloud that'll fit that and ditto on AI, where AI should be looked upon as the way to get the value out of the data that people collect, both their internal data and external data. Now, I don't want to also comment on big or small. Size is not a priority. It's about being thoughtful and strategic. And so, you should expect that over time, over time meaning just that as it gets past the next few months, we will get back to an acquisitive strategy. Jim? With respect to a more technical approach to selling, it's a journey we have been on, but actually the current crisis in effect catapulted us or accelerated what we are doing. And I'll touch on sort of three elements. We have always wanted to have our product teams do a lot of demonstrations and proof-of-concepts that we are now going to them virtually, where we stand the properties up on our public cloud and then allow the clients to sort of play around with them. And so, you take away the weeks of doing it in a more traditional manner.Second, in our services teams, they're doing a lot of what they call virtual garages. So, a garage used to be that we would have our consultants and our implementers sit side-by-side with our client and go do those. But, when you do have social distancing and it's not just us, our clients don't really want us on premise either, they have now become virtual garages, but there's an advantage there by the way. A bigger advantage is it allows you to actually get access to skills that are around the globe, not just those that may be physically co-resident at a client. And that is again not much more technical approach. And then, third with a lot of remote delivery happening in the GTS part of the business, they are also bringing a much more technical solution to bear through this. So, those are the elements that I mentioned, but you can expect us to do more and more of this as we go along.And Jim, I'll give it to you for the second part. Thanks, Toni. Look, Toni. If we look at our industry, it's a fast-moving industry with a lot of change that goes on all the time. If I look at where we were five years ago, and if I fast forward to today, Red Hat was not there, Cloud Paks were not there. Our cloud backlog inside services was a tiny and fraction of what it is today. And I would look at all of that and say it looks like in aggregate, likely about half our business has changed in the last five to seven years. That's, I think, the hallmark of a successful company. When you begin to change it, it takes advantage of the relationship, the value, the incumbency we have with our clients and it also takes advantage of the fast move -- fast moving nature of technology.Now, the question you didn't ask what I thought I'd put in there is the questions of the focus. I think the focus is going to be much more around what we've been talking about it, is going to be around in the near term, is going to be around hybrid clouds and AI, with likely quantum coming down the road, which I do believe has a $0.5 trillion worth of value to give back to our clients since you give me the five-year horizon, not just one or two-year horizon. So, let me sort of begin with that and say that. And it's hard to put that on a scale of 1 to 10 because you didn't tell me how much of it changes in 10. But I gave you the sense that probably half of things change. Jim? Okay. Thanks, Matt. Let me start with that because look from -- April tends to be a month where, as Jim pointed out, it's not just in the first quarter. And every -- in every quarter, larger transactions do tend to get bunched up at the end of the quarter. I'd say that probably is more June than April. And you also asked a question on the energy [ph] side of the business or what I would call subscription. We haven't seen, at least so far any big change in the subscription side, coming into April. Now that is no doubt because as both of us have pointed out, we do tend to run our client's mission critical workload. It's not the workload that'll be the first to turn off. If anything, it'll be amongst the last to get impacted. And so, the subscription side, we feel quite good about it. Now, on the transaction side, so far things are holding up, but it's too early to tell. That's one of the reasons you heard what Jim and I talk about withdrawing guidance because of a little bit of a progress is not enough give us a full view into what will happen this quarter. Jim? So, let me start. You said what KPIs or what metrics should you use? Look, I think, I've been clear, we should look at growth as the metric, albeit once we begin to emerge from the pandemic. And it's impossible for me to predict how long this is going to be. You mentioned two scenarios, but I've listened to all of you and your peers, and I don't have any particular crystal ball on this. The estimates are all over the place on both the depth and the length of the impact.Now, the other one that I think you should hold us to in metric, other than revenue or a pure financial metric is the number of clients on which we are engaged on hybrid cloud engagement. We talk about it from a product perspective, we talk about 2,200 clients to date. But as we begin to wrap those also with services engagement, I think that's the second metric that is effectively a leading indicator towards the overall revenue metrics, because that's the precondition for that. And that's where we are driving the entire company to. That's what I'm focused on. I run a war room on that every week. And that's what our sales forces are incented to go get done. So, Jim, I don't know whether you want to add something. We already answered the question I think. So, you asked about criteria, size, accretion, and the thing. Look, I think, on all three, one that is easiest, size. Size is not a criterion. So, I'm just going to put that to the side. As Jim said a couple of times, we have enough fin flex to do a fair number of things and most things that we might, I think are possible for us to be able to get done. So, I'll put size aside and say that's not really an issue.You asked about accretion and decretion. Jim and I are clear. We manage the business for the long term. So, if it becomes accretive, often a year or two, as we described about Red Hat, that's more than sufficient for us. It doesn't have to be accretive on month one or day one. As long as it's a healthy business, provides us the kind of growth profile, and provides us the ability to get sufficient synergy, both for IBM and for the property itself. Both have to be winners. It cannot just be one of us. Otherwise, it's not that attractive.And then, you said about criteria. The criteria is, those things that make our clients value us even higher, and the areas we have chosen to be their trusted partner on is hybrid cloud and AI. So, that's sort of the criteria.But, please take a wide stance on hybrid clouds. Hybrid cloud encompasses how we connect private and public, it connects -- it includes how we might secure them, if might include the data that is inside those properties, provides more visibility. And as we shift that out over time, that will widen even more, because the definition of what is the cloud market, also tends to change over time. So hopefully that answered your question, but it's something we give a lot of thought to. I think, David, we are always looking at this and always looking at portfolio optimization. I would not say because of the pandemic or COVID-19 would we look at this. As you saw last year, we divested in the software portfolio quite a few things that were core to hybrid cloud. They were around marketing properties and as service properties around many of our retail clients. It didn't really necessarily fit or pull along or had synergy with the core hybrid cloud portfolio. So, it made sense to divest them. I think, we're done with that round, just to be upfront.Now, as we always look and say, does this or does this not bring value? Is there a reason for our client to have both, the core hybrid cloud portfolio and something? We're going to reevaluate that all the time, but I don't have something to name for you that we are trying to do right now. As the quarters go along, as the months go along, we will do it. But I also want to be clear that for the next few months, we have to be focused on the stability of the business. And we have to be focused on making sure that we preserve our liquidity and our balance sheet. So, that's what we've kind of focused on for the very near term. Look, I think that -- I think, we had acknowledged the market value growth of other things. So, while we have always selected on high value, and to your point on clients, we measure our net promoter score or NPS, which I think is widely regarded as being one of the best metrics of how clients value what they're getting from you. And that has actually improved substantially, I think over 10 points if I remember over the last two years. So, given that the NPS is improving, our clients are much more delighted with what they get from us. Now, that said, the overall portfolio has to be able to grow to return -- to make investors happier. And that's why we are clear. You noticed me announce a lot of our management team at the beginning. I think this is a team that's going to be able to deliver growth back to the market.So, Jim Kavanaugh of course, as you heard him talk about capital allocation and how he's going to use that fin flex to enable both organic and inorganic investment. Jim Whitehurst who many of you know well who has dealt really well both the crises when he was at Delta and then growth, when he was at Red Hat. Bridget van Kralingen, who has a strong record of understanding client needs and is going to draw some of the go-to-market changes we mentioned. Howard Boville that we're bringing in who was at Bank of America who has a deep empathy and understanding for some of our largest clients, but also who drove a lot of efficiency when he was at the Bank. And he can bring those attributes to the clients as well. And Mark Foster who has Services and who has a real intention for growth and for making sure that he brings value to our clients and services.We put all that together. And I think it is a team that can go deliver growth. But let's also be clear. We can talk about what is important, is it growth or is it only EPS or is it only liquidity? Look, liquidity is essential, without that no company is going to survive through the next period, and I don't know how long the period is going to be. So, I think our obsession with that is going to serve us well in this period. But, what are you hearing me say is that growth has to be an equal obsession to other metrics that are there, so we are going to go do that.So, may not be a completely full answer, Keith, but we'll probably get there as the months go on and we get more clarity.So, I think, that was the last question, if I remember. So, let me make a few comments to wrap up the call. These are truly unprecedented times. Over the coming weeks and months, we're going to continue to focus on our employees, our clients, and how we can help broader society. As difficult as this crisis is, it presents an opportunity for IBM as a technology leader and as a trusted partner.Personally, it's an interesting and exciting time to be taking on this role. I look forward to continuing this dialog with all of you and will update you at the end of the second quarter. Thank you."

This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.  I'll remind you the separation of our managed infrastructure services business, Kyndryl, was completed on November 3. As a result, our income statement is presented on a continuing operations basis. Our results also reflect the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl. Because this provides a onetime lift to our growth, we will provide the contribution to our revenue growth for the next year.  In the spirit of providing additional information to investors, our presentation also includes non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC.  Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.  So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thank you, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results reinforce our confidence in our strategy and model. With solid revenue growth, we are on track to the mid-single-digit trajectory we had laid out in our investor briefing last October.  The trend we see is clear. Across industries, clients see technology has a major source of competitive advantage. They realize that powerful technologies embedded at the heart of their business can lead to seismic shifts in the way they create value. This reality of technology being about a lot more than cost will persist and explains why clients are eager to leverage hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence to move their business forward.  Our fourth quarter results illustrates the strong client demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. IBM Consulting again had double-digit revenue growth as our ecosystem play continues to gain momentum. Software revenue growth reflects strength in Red Hat and our automation offerings. Infrastructure had a good quarter, especially with regards to IBM Z and storage.  Over the last 1.5 years, we have taken a series of actions to execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and improve our revenue profile, optimizing our portfolio, increasing investments, expanding our ecosystem and simplifying our go-to market. As we start to yield benefits from these actions, our constant currency performance improved through 2021.  Our most significant portfolio action was the separation of Kyndryl. You will remember we had initially expected the spin by the end of the year, and we completed it in early November. As we discuss our results, we'll focus on the new basis and structure that encompasses today's IBM. As we look to 2022, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year. Both of these are consistent with our medium-term model.  Let me now spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the market, how we address it and the progress we are making. We are seeing high demand for our capabilities in several areas. Clients are eager to automate as many business class as possible, especially given the new employee demographics. This dynamic is likely to play out over the long term. They are also using AI and predictive capabilities to mitigate friction in their supply chains. Cybersecurity remains a major area of concern as the cost of cybercrime, already in the billions of dollars, rises each year. As clients deal with these challenges and opportunities, they are looking for a partner they can trust and who has a proven track record in bringing about strategic transformation projects. This is why our strategy is focused on helping our clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and AI.  Hybrid cloud is about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private cloud and as-a-service properties that our clients typically have. Our approach is platform-centric, and the platform we have built is open, secure and flexible and it provides a solid base of the multiplier effect across software and services for IBM and our ecosystem partners.  It starts with Red Hat, which offers clients unique software capabilities based on open source innovation. Our software, which has been optimized for that platform, helps our clients apply AI, automation and security to transform and improve their business workflows. Our consultants deliver deep business expertise and they cocreate with our clients to advance their digital transformation journeys. And our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment.  This strategy, along with the differentiated capabilities we bring to bear to our clients, have led to an increase in platform adoption and new business opportunities across the stack. We now have more than 3,800 hybrid cloud platform clients, which is up 1,000 clients from this time last year.  IBM Consulting continues to help drive platform adoption, with about 700 Red Hat engagements for the year. Clients like Dun & Bradstreet, National Grid, AIB and Volkswagen have all recently chosen IBM's broad hybrid cloud and AI capabilities to transform their processes and move their business forward.  As I look back on the year, we had good success in broadening our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and to better respond to client needs. During our investor briefing, we talked about strategic partnerships that will yield billion-dollar businesses within IBM Consulting. As we move towards that, we had more than 50% revenue growth this year in partnerships with AWS, Azure and Salesforce. This adds to the strong strategic partnerships we have with others such as SAP, Oracle and Adobe.  We're continuing to broaden our ecosystem reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Salesforce to run MuleSoft integration software on Red Hat OpenShift. We also created a host of new consulting services with SAP to help clients accelerate their journey to S/4HANA. Together with Deloitte, we announced DAPPER, an AI-enabled, managed analytics solution. And we have expanded our partnership with EY to help organizations leverage hybrid cloud, AI and automation capabilities to transform HR operations. We have also recently announced a host of new strategic partnerships with Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and TELUS, all focused on the deployment of 5G, edge and network automation capabilities.  During 2021, we have been making changes to increase our focus and agility and build a stronger client-centric culture. This includes putting experiential selling, client engineering and cocreation at the heart of our client engagement model. We have completed thousands of IBM Garage engagements. And today, we have nearly 3,000 active engagements. We've invested in hundreds of customer success managers to help clients capture more value from our solutions. And we have upgraded our skills with fewer generalists and more technical specialists.  This is resonating well with our clients, and it's starting to contribute to our performance. The most important metric, of course, is revenue growth, but we are also pleased to see our client renewal rates increasing and our recurring revenue base growing. We are starting to see signs of sales productivity improvements, with average productivity per technology seller increasing from the first to the second half. At the same time, innovations that matter to our clients remain a constant focus, and our teams have worked hard to deliver a series of important innovations in the past quarter.  Starting with AI, we added new natural language processing enhancements to Watson Discovery. We're also combining and integrating products such as Turbonomic, Instana and Watson AIOps to offer a complete set of AI-powered automation software to address the significant demand. This quarter, Red Hat announced that the Ansible automation platform is now available on Microsoft Azure, bringing more flexibility to clients and how they adopt automation.  In partnership with Samsung Electronics, IBM announced a breakthrough that reorients how transistors are built upon the surface of a chip to enable tremendous increases in energy density. In Quantum, we unveiled Eagle, 127-qubit quantum processor. This is the first quantum chip that breaks the 100-cubic barrier and represents a key milestone on our path towards building a 1,000-cubit processor in 2023.  While organic innovations are important, we continue to acquire companies that complement and strengthen our portfolio. We made 5 acquisitions in the fourth quarter and a total of 15 acquisitions in 2021. 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Envizi. Many consumers are willing to pay more for products that are made by companies that are more environmentally sustainable. As the world continues to move towards a more circular economy, our clients' need is the ability to manage and measure their progress. Envizi's capabilities complement our own and help us respond to that client demand.  Sustainability is important across a number of stakeholder groups, including clients, employees and investors. We are continuing to make good progress and are particularly proud of our diversity and inclusion scores, and our ability to attract and retain talent. Our efforts were recently recognized by JUST Capital who named IBM as one of America's most just companies.  Let me now close by emphasizing once again our fourth quarter results strengthen the conviction that we have in our ability to deliver our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth.  Jim will take you through the fourth quarter and then provide more color on 2022. Jim, over to you.\nJames Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, 58% operating gross margin, operating pretax income of $3.5 billion and operating EPS of $3.35 for continuing operations.  Last January, we said we expected performance to improve over the course of 2021 as we start to benefit from the actions we've taken. We have seen progress in our constant currency revenue growth rate every quarter and now again in the fourth. This is the first view of IBM post separation.  We had solid revenue performance, up nearly 9%. I'll remind you, this includes the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, and we said we would be transparent on the contribution to our revenue growth for the first year. This quarter, our revenue growth includes about 3.5 points from the new relationship. Excluding this, IBM's revenue was up 5%.  We have aligned our operating model and segment structure to our platform-centric approach. In the fourth quarter, Software was up 10%, and Consulting was up 16%. These are our 2 growth vectors and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue. Infrastructure, more of a value vector, tends to follow product cycles and was up 2%. The Software and Infrastructure growth each include nearly 5 points from the new Kyndryl relationship while there is no contribution to Consulting's growth.  Our platform-centric model has attractive economics. For every dollar of hybrid platform revenue, IBM and our ecosystem partners can generate $3 to $5 of software, $6 to $8 of services and $1 to $2 of infrastructure revenue. This drives IBM's hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 19% for the year. Post separation, revenue from our full stack cloud capabilities from Infrastructure up through Consulting now represents $20 billion of revenue or 35% of our total.  Looking at our P&L metrics. Our operating gross profit was up 3%, and the $3.5 billion of operating pretax profit was up over 100%. Operating net income and earnings per share also grew.  Let me highlight a couple of items within our profit performance. First, the year-to-year pretax profit reflects $1.5 billion charge to SG&A last year for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model and improve our go-forward position. We're continuing to invest to drive growth. Throughout the year, we have been aggressively hiring, with about 60% of our hires in Consulting. We're scaling resources in Garages, sign engineering centers and customer success managers, all to better serve our clients. We're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like Quantum. We're ramping investment in our ecosystem, and we acquired 15 companies in 2021 to provide skills and technologies aligned to our strategy, including capabilities to help win client architecture decisions.  Regarding tax, our fourth quarter operating tax rate was 14%. This was up significantly from last year but roughly 2 to 3 points lower than what we estimated in October due to a number of factors, including the actual product and geographic mix of our income in the quarter.  Let me spend a minute on our free cash flow and balance sheet position. Our full year consolidated cash from operations was $12.8 billion, and free cash flow was $6.5 billion. These are all-in consolidated results and include 10 months of Kyndryl and the cash paid for the 2020 structural actions and spin charges. IBM's stand-alone or baseline free cash flow for the year was $7.9 billion, which is aligned to our go-forward business. This excludes Kyndryl charges and pre-separation activity but includes the IBM portion of the structural actions. Payments for these IBM-related structural actions and deferred cash tax paid in 2021 contributed to the year-to-year decline in the stand-alone results.  In terms of uses of cash for the year, we invested over $3 billion in acquisitions. We continue to delever, with debt down nearly $10 billion for the year and over $21 billion since closing the Red Hat acquisition. And we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a year-end cash position of $7.6 billion, including marketable securities and debt of just under $52 billion.  Our balance sheet remains strong, and I'd say the same for our retirement-related plans. You'll remember that over the last years, we've shifted our asset base to a lower risk profile. In 2021, the combination of modest returns and higher discount rates improved the funded status of our plans. In aggregate, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 107%, with the U.S. at 112%.  Now I'll turn to the details by segment, and I'll remind you we have put in place a simplified management system and segment structure aligned to our platform-centric model. And within the segments, we're now providing new revenue categories and metrics that will provide greater transparency into business trends and drivers.  IBM Software delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. This was driven by good revenue performance in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the new Kyndryl content. Software is important to our hybrid cloud strategy and our financial model. Our hybrid cloud revenue in software is up 25% for the year to more than $8.5 billion. And subscription and support renewal rates continue to grow again this quarter, contributing to a $700 million increase in the software deferred income balance over the last year. Hybrid platform and solutions revenue was up 9%. This performance is an indication of the strength across the software growth areas focused on hybrid cloud and AI. It's worth mentioning this includes only a point of help from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship.  Let me highlight some of the trends by business area. Red Hat revenue, all in, was up 21%. Both infrastructure and app dev and emerging tech grew double digits as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprise's critical hybrid cloud requirements. With this performance, we're continuing to take share with our Red Hat offerings.  Automation delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. As Arvind mentioned, there is strong market demand for automation. We had good performance in AIOps and management this quarter as we address resource management and observability. Clients are realizing rapid time to value from Instana and Turbonomic, 2 of our automation acquisitions. And integration grew with continued traction in Cloud Pak for Integration.  Data and AI revenue grew 3%. We have particular strength in data fabric, which enables clients to connect siloed data distributed across the hybrid cloud landscape without moving it. You'll recall, we talked about the data fabric opportunity back in October. We also had strong performance in business analytics and weather. Within these solutions, clients are leveraging our AI to ensure AI models are governed to operate in a fair and transparent manner.  Security revenue declined modestly in the quarter driven by lower performance in data security, while revenue grew 5% for the year. As we called out in our recent investor briefing, security innovation is an integral part of our strategy. In December, we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, with further plans to modernize the broader portfolio throughout the year. This quarter, we also completed the acquisition of ReaQta, which leverages AI and machine learning to automatically identify and block threats at the end point. Putting this all together, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is now over $13 billion, which is up 8% this quarter. This demonstrates the momentum in our hybrid platform and AI strategy, including Red Hat and our suite of Cloud Paks.  Moving to transaction processing. Revenue was up 14%. This is above our model driven by a few underlying dynamics. First, all of the growth in transaction processing came from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship, which contributed more than 16 points of growth. Second, I'll remind you that we're wrapping on a very weak performance in the fourth quarter of last year, which was down 26%. And lastly, we had some large perpetual license transactions given the good expansion in the IBM Z capacity we've seen this cycle. While the new capacity is important, what's just as important is the continued strong renewal rates this quarter. These are both good proof points of our clients' commitment to our infrastructure platform and these high-value software offerings.  Looking at software profit. We expanded pretax margin by 12 points, including nearly 10 points of improvement from last year's structural actions. Turning to Consulting. Revenue grew 16% with acceleration across all 3 revenue categories. Complementing this strong revenue performance, our book-to-bill was 1.2. Clients are accelerating their business transformations powered by hybrid cloud and AI to drive innovation, increase agility and productivity and capture new growth opportunities. Enterprises are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner on this journey. They are choosing us for our deep client, industry and technical expertise, which drives adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and pulls through key technologies.  Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 34% in the quarter. For the year, cloud revenue is up 32% to $8 billion. Offerings and application modernization, which are centered on Red Hat, contributed to this growth. The Red Hat-related signings more than doubled this year and are now over $4 billion since inception. This quarter, we added over 150 client engagements, bringing the total since inception to over 1,000.  Our strategic partnerships also drove our performance. Revenue from these partnerships accelerated as the year progressed and was up solid double digits in the fourth quarter led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure.  Turning to our business areas. Our Consulting's growth was led by business transformation, which was up 20%. Business transformation brings together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. To enable this, we leverage skills and capabilities in IBM technologies and with strategic ecosystem partners such as SAP, Salesforce and Adobe. Our practices are centered on areas such as finance and supply chain, talent, industry-specific solutions and digital design. This quarter, we had broad-based growth, reflecting strong demand for these solutions.  In technology consulting, revenue was up 19%. Technology consulting architects and implements cloud platforms and strategies. We leverage hybrid cloud with Red Hat OpenShift and work with providers, such as AWS and Azure, in addition to IBM Cloud. This quarter, we continue to see good performance in application modernization offerings that build cloud native applications and that modernize existing applications for the cloud.  Finally, application operations revenue grew 8%. This business line focuses on application and cloud platform services required to operationalize and run in both cloud and on-premise environments. Revenue growth was driven by offerings, which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments.  Moving to consulting profit. Our pretax income margin expanded about 8 points, including just over 9 points from last year's structural actions. We're in a competitive labor market, and we continue to have increased pressure on labor costs due to higher acquisition, retention and wages. While we still expect to capture this value in our engagements, it will take a few quarters to appear in our profit profile.  So now turning to the new Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 2%. The Kyndryl commercial relationship contributed about 5 points of growth, which is higher than we expected in October. In this segment, we brought together hybrid infrastructure with infrastructure support, which was formerly technology support services. This allows us to better manage the life cycle of our hardware platforms and to provide end-to-end value for our clients.  Hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support revenue were up 2% and 1%, respectively, with pretty consistent contribution from the new Kyndryl relationship. Hybrid infrastructure includes IBM Z and distributed infrastructure. IBM Z revenue performance, now inclusive of both hardware and operating system, is down 4% this quarter. This is the 10th quarter of z15 availability and the combination of security, scalability and reliability continues to resonate with clients. This program continues to outpace the strong z14 program, and we ship more MIPS in the z15 program than any program in our history. Our clients are leveraging IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. And then in distributed infrastructure, revenue was up 7% driven by pervasive strength across our storage portfolio.  Looking at infrastructure profit. The pretax margin was up over 9 points but essentially flat, normalizing for last year's structural action.  Now I'll wrap up with a discussion of how our investments and actions position us for 2022 and the longer term. We've been laser-focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our portfolio, our capital allocation and the moves we've been making are all designed to create value through focus for our clients, our partners, our employees and our shareholders.  We took significant steps during 2021. The most impactful portfolio action was, of course, the separation of Kyndryl. We've also been allocating capital to higher growth areas, investing in skills and innovation and expanding our ecosystem. We've aligned our business to a more platform-centric business model. And we're simplifying and redesigning our go-to-market to better meet client needs and execute on our growth agenda.  Bottom line, we're exiting 2021 a different company. We have a higher growth, higher value business mix, with over 70% of our revenue in software and services and a significant recurring revenue base dominated by software. This will result in improving revenue growth profile, higher operating margin, strong and growing free cash flow and lower capital intensity, leading to a higher return on invested capital business.  We also continue to have attractive shareholder returns through dividends. In October, we laid out a model for IBM's performance over the medium term defined as 2022 through 2024. The model is focused on our 2 most important measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. As we enter the new year, I'll talk about our expectations for 2022 performance along those dimensions.  Starting with revenue. We expect to grow revenue at mid-single-digit rate at constant currency. That's consistent with the model. On top of that, in 2022, the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl will contribute an additional 3 points of growth spread across the first 3 quarters.  Currency dynamics, unfortunately, will be a headwind. At current spot rates, currency is roughly a 2-point headwind to reported revenue growth for the year and 3 points in the first quarter.  For free cash flow, we expect to generate $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. To be clear, this is an all-in free cash flow definition. The adjusted free cash flow view we provided in 2021 was useful given the significant cash impact associated with the separation and structural actions. Now in 2022, despite the fact we still have nearly $0.5 billion of impact from the charges, we're focusing on a traditional free cash flow definition. The $10 billion to $10.5 billion reflects a year-to-year improvement driven by lower payments for the structural actions, a modest tailwind from cash taxes, working capital improvements and profit growth resulting from our higher growth and higher value business mix. With this performance, we're on track to our model.  So now let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance. Because this is a new segment structure, I'm going to spend a little more time and provide perspective on constant currency revenue growth and pretax margin in the context of our segment models.  In Software, as we benefit from the investments in innovation and our go-to-market changes, we're seeing progress in our Software growth rate. In 2022, we expect growth at the low end of the mid-single-digit model and then another 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from our external sales to Kyndryl. We expect Software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year.  We have solid momentum in IBM Consulting revenue and expect this to continue into 2022 as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and our book-to-bill ratio support revenue at the high end of our high single-digit model for the year, with double-digit growth in the first half. We expect low double-digit pretax margin for the full year with improving performance through the year as we make progress on price realization.  Infrastructure revenue performance will vary with product cycle. In 2022, with a new IBM Z introduction late in the first half, we expect performance above the model and a slight contribution to IBM's overall growth. On top of that, we're planning for about 2 to 3 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. This supports a high-teens pretax margin rate for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics will yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax operating margin for the full year and 2 to 3 points in the first quarter. In terms of tax, we expect a mid- to high teens tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth.  Bringing this all together, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year, both in line with our midterm model.  Patricia, let's go to the Q&A.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. In addition to our regular materials, we've included a summary of our new segments for your reference and historical data on segment pretax income. . Sheila, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani: Jim, I want to go back to this $10 billion to $10.5 billion free cash flow number for calendar '22. I know there's a lot of moving parts here. So it's more than what I think many had been modeling. And if I think about the Analyst Day framework we have talked about, it was supposed to be a $10 billion free cash flow in '20, adding $750 million, if I remember correctly, annually. So I would put this somewhere in $11.5 billion range, I think, is what I would have expected. So can you just talk about either relative to that, if you want. What is the delta to free cash flow? What are the puts and takes there? That would be really helpful.\nJames Kavanaugh: Sure. Amit, thank you very much for the question. First, let's just ground everyone because I want to make sure we have absolute clarity as we're returning to reporting all-in free cash flow to, one, align to our consistency of IBM's post-separation baseline, to your point, the $10 billion in 2020 and, more importantly, to align to our forward-looking guidance, which we talked at Investor Day, with a midterm model of $35 billion cumulatively over 2022 to 2024. For 2022 specifically, as you heard me say, we expect free cash flow to be between $10 billion and $10.5 billion all-in. And that puts us right on track for the $35 billion, mainly, Amit, because it includes still the remaining structural actions charges of about $0.5 billion in 2022. And when you look at that, because of structural actions, you're not going to have linearity in that $35 billion throughout 2022 to 2023 to 2024.  So let me talk just a little bit so we get clarity around the drivers, to your point, at the heart of your question. First, we do have about $0.5 billion remaining in the cash impacts from the structural charges, as I stated earlier. That means year-to-year, it's about $1 billion, give or take, benefit. Second, we anticipate about $0.5 billion of working capital efficiency just based on our AR dynamics around volume. And also, we're entering a mainframe cycle late in the first half. Third, very minimal tailwind with regards to cash tax, which basically means the majority of this has to be delivered on our operational profit and invest less, I should say, investments in capital expenditures. And that's going to come from revenue growth at our model, mid-single digit, before we add on Kyndryl; operating leverage, which we talked about, about 4 points improvement for the year; a mainframe cycle; and us continuing to address the remaining stranded costs from the separation of Kyndryl as we move forward.  So we feel very comfortable, one, $10 billion to $10.5 billion puts us in position to that $35 billion; and two, more importantly, that this cash provides us with ample financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically, and return significant value to our shareholders with our committed dividend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.\nKathryn Huberty: Arvind, I couldn't agree more with your comments about the structural uplift in IT spending from technology diffusion across all sectors. But as you think about the stock market volatility over the last several weeks, is there any reason to believe that there could be some near-term cyclical impact from that volatility? And then maybe if you can also comment on whether the recent pullback in software valuations increases the likelihood that you might look at doing bigger M&A this year.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Katy, for the question, and thank you for also noticing and acknowledging the robust IT spending environment. Look, Katy, I mean like if I react to every stock market intraday volatility, that's a full-time occupation. I think today showed that actually these cycles are hard to predict. And if I back up and look at our clients, I think they are not really reacting to these volatilities. We saw this in the middle of 2020 also, not just in 2021 and 2022. For the first time, despite a down business cycle in 2020, we saw people actually decide to keep up their IT spending.  Now I'll acknowledge in 2020, they did put a break on capital spending within IT, but they all acknowledge that IT spending was critical to how they would come out. And that showed up in 2021 spending, okay? So I suspect -- look, we are not as much expert on this as many of you on this call, but I would suspect that this volatility we are seeing recently will not have much of an impact. Now if it becomes into an overall bear market, correction, that would be different, but I don't think we're anywhere close to that.  I think in terms of near-term cyclical impacts, I don't really see them. Our clients tend to be people who are in much more -- what we provide technology for is much more in the critical applications. People need them for doing online payments. They need them for authorizations, reservations, retail banking, health care, telecom, within the government for critical applications. So we don't tend to see much of a short-term cyclical impact.  Now on your last question, valuations. Look, I'm always clear, valuations -- M&A has to have an economic benefit for our company and our shareholders. Has valuations come down? Certainly, some targets may become more approachable that were not previously approachable. And I've said before, look, we have a little over $20 billion of flexibility over the next 3 years. So I'll just leave it at that. That's our total flexibility. As prices come down, certainly, more things come within range.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: Really, just some clarifications. You talked about the year-over-year improvement in PTI of about 4 points. It looks like the year-over-year Kyndryl contribution of $1.8 billion in revenue should come in at extremely high marginal contribution, maybe 70%, and then you're going to have a year-over-year contribution from fewer charges. So maybe you could dimension each of those and talk about whether you believe underlying PTI will improve. And then similarly, if you could just clarify your expectation for the acquisition contribution to revenue in 2022. And you didn't mention the divestiture of Watson Health. How we should think about that? Is that in addition to -- should we be factoring it in on top of the guidance? Or does your guidance include the divestiture of Watson Health's revenues?\nJames Kavanaugh: Toni, I'll take this. Thank you very much for the question. A handful there to address overall. So if I got it correctly, first of all, yes, we talked about our guidance, coming off of a very solid fourth quarter, gives us confidence in the foundation to really build on our midterm model. And we said 2022 would be the next step. We have progress, more work to do, mid-single-digit growth pre the Kyndryl contribution, operating margins up about 4 points and then free cash flow, as I answered Amit, at $10 billion to $10.5 billion.  So when you look at that operating profit overall, first of all, yes, we're very transparent in our 2 key measures of success. Number one, the contribution of revenue growth. And we said we're going to be up mid-single digit prior to adding the Kyndryl 3 points roughly for the year. And the second key measure, which we've got our entire business, our operating model, aligned to, is free cash flow generation. And we're very transparent in our free cash flow generation that, that is all-in, with a baseline -- IBM post-separation baseline of $7.9 billion we reported in '21 going to $10 billion to $10.5 billion, on its way to delivering $35 billion cumulatively over time. Within that, I gave you the breakout of the bridge on cash flow. No matter how you cut it, we are going to invest more in capital expenditures this year. But when you take out the working capital efficiency of $0.5 billion, a very modest cash tax tailwind, and you take out the $0.5 billion of structural charges, you get substantial operating profit growth.  And I would tell you, although we're not going to disclose based on commercial competitive reasons around the profitability of Kyndryl overall, and I don't think you would expect us because we don't do that with any strategic partner or client, that, that is a minimal component of the required operational profit improvement for 2022 overall. So we feel pretty good about the confidence in our guidance. It positions us on that midterm model, and it gives us tremendous financial flexibility to continue to invest, to extend our hybrid cloud leadership, invest in innovation to bring on new technology and return significant value back to our shareholders overall. I think that was the first one.  The second one, acquisition revenue contribution. Obviously, we've got work to do to close this. This won't close until later in the second quarter. And at that point in time, we will disclose information around Watson Health and what the implications are to our guidance overall, and we'll update investors as we always do.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan: Arvind, as you think about the midterm model and layer in some of these puts and takes that you guys highlighted in 2022, you could have up to maybe a couple of points of benefit from M&A and maybe up to a point from mainframe. As you look into 2023, some of these elements will turn into headwinds, particularly maybe up to 2 points from infrastructure. What are the things that you're looking at that should grow better than 2022 and 2023 to offset some of this to get back to that mid-single trajectory? And Jim, can you address 2022 seasonality for revenue growth and cash flow given the Kyndryl separation and really very different timing on the Z cycle?\nArvind Krishna: Yes. So Wamsi, thanks. Let me address the first part of the question, the mid-single-digit growth in 2022 going to 2023. Let me remind you, when we did our Investor Day in early October, we talked about the mid-single-digit growth comes from -- about 2 points of that for IBM comes from the Consulting growth, about between 1 and 2 points comes from the Red Hat growth and then we would get some from Infrastructure, aka mainframe, but there's more than mainframe. There's storage in there, and there's also power product cycles and then organic software. If you put that all together, you would get more than mid-single digit in a given year.  But we begin to see cycles of that. For example, on mainframe, when we say it comes late in the first half, that means it's really a second half '22 contribution. That carries on then into the first half of '23, maybe until the third quarter, maybe longer, depending on the cycle. If I look at Red Hat, we fully expect that to carry on. If I look at Consulting, we expect that to carry on. So if I look at all the underlying components and then as I bake in the acquisitions into software, those will begin to contribute a bit more and a bit more each year.  You asked about the overall acquisitions. I think that will give us about a point each year, which is what we had said before. But that is inside what I talked about, the 2 points and the 1 to 2 points and the point and the point. And so that is the thesis here. And by the way, so if you look at what I laid out, '22 and '23 look remarkably similar, not that different.  Jim, you want to -- the seasonality question?\nJames Kavanaugh: Yes. Wamsi, thank you very much. A very important question when we think about 2022, just building on what Arvind just said right there. If you think about the revenue growth profile and how it's going to play out in 2022, as we stated earlier, we expect the mainframe cycle this year, and that will happen late in the first half. So read that minimal contribution in 2Q and then mostly in the second half.  But second, really, the big point I want to get out is, you can quite expect, due to the separation of Kyndryl, which was a highly annuitized-based business, I think we're going to have a different business skew throughout 2022 on top of the product cycle that I just talked about earlier. I would expect somewhere in the neighborhood, around profit, to be about 40-60 first half, second half. But I would tell you, underneath that 40% in the first half, it's going to be skewed more towards second quarter just given the new introduction of our mainframe cycle. And also last year, we had a very strong first quarter mainframe. We grew over 20%. So we're wrapping on a GA plus 11 quarter at the end of its cycle on the most successful mainframe program we've had, program to date. We're very late in that cycle. So I would expect more of that profit to be in second quarter and again 40 to 60 first half, second half.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup.\nJames Suva: Both Jim and Arvind, you guys have done a tremendous amount of heavy lifting and work over the past couple of years, all the way from integration of Red Hat to spin out of Kyndryl. Looking ahead now, just strategically, my one question is, are we looking at the core company as now it's really time to harvest everything? Or are there still some more transformational or pruning or spinning out going on? And I'm not referring to the Watson Health, I'm talking about more bigger things. It seems like now it's time to start harvesting things, but maybe I'm not hearing your comments correctly.\nArvind Krishna: Jim, let me take that. This is Arvind. Look, I think that we have done a lot of the heavy lifting we need. I fundamentally believe that we have the right portfolio and we have the right focus to be delivering on our midterm model. Maybe I didn't quite understand the word harvest. I wouldn't say harvest. We have the correct portfolio to be able to grow where our clients have got demand and where the market has demand. We are now approximately a 30% consulting company, a 70% technology company. It's -- about a little bit under half is software.  If I look in software, yes, there is a portion that is very much focused on transaction processing. We believe that model is going to be a mid-single-digit decline over the very long term. And if you look at some of the dynamics that Jim Kavanaugh talked about, you kind of see that then if you go over the past couple of years. Then if I look at automation, security, data and AI, I think these play very much into where there is a lot of demand in the market. If I look at consulting, that's how clients are going to go get their projects on digital transformation completed. And then if you look at hybrid infrastructure, we are quite focused in infrastructure on the areas that align to our high-value model. And if I look at both storage and mainframe, they give us a lot of benefit to also help drive the other parts of the portfolio.  If I got it right, Jim, to your question, no, you should not expect any major strategic divestitures like we just have talked about with Kyndryl. I think those are behind us. Now we have the portfolio that allows us to deliver on our medium-term more.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel.\nDavid Grossman: This is a question for Jim. Jim, if we take your revenue growth comments about '22 and the margin comments, it would just seem to yield net income below your free cash flow guide. And obviously, I'm assuming the new model, given the combination of software and professional services, would yield free cash flow of about 1x on a conversion basis. So if that math is right, can you help reconcile the difference between the implied EPS guide to that $10 billion and $10.5 billion of free cash flow?\nJames Kavanaugh: Yes. Well, David, as we've talked, since Arvind has come on and taken over as Chairman and CEO, we have aligned our portfolio. We've aligned our capital investment allocation structure. We've aligned the operating model in this company. And I'm a very big believer in focus. And that focus is around 2 measures: revenue growth and free cash flow. So I am not going to talk about EPS guidance. And by the way, EPS, as you know quite well, there are many ways of getting to an EPS number.  But I've given the breakout of the revenue growth overall. We've been very transparent mid-single digit. We said we're going to get an operating leverage improvement of about 4 points. When we broke that out by segment, we're going to get Software, we expect, up to mid-20s on our path to approaching 30 in our midterm model. We said around Consulting at the high end of our high single-digit revenue growth model. We're going to approach about 10% coming off of about 8.5 point margin business in 2021. And then Infrastructure, given we've got a product cycle, we expect above model on revenue, as Arvind answered earlier. It'll be a slight contribution to IBM, and we expect the operating margins in Infrastructure to be in the high teens.  When you take all those components, what I just brought out, and then you do the free cash flow bridge, you get to quite healthy profit contribution to deliver that free cash flow. And I think, David, that is the focus that Arvind has got, 250,000 IBMers mobilized on revenue growth, that operating margin by segment to deliver the product mix and productivity and that free cash flow. And that's what we're going to continue to guide on as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyle McNealy: This one is about the trajectory of the Infrastructure business given the moderation in growth that you saw last quarter in Q3 and then the better performance you saw this quarter. Do you got any added confidence now after the performance this quarter that we won't see another soft quarter like in Q3 before we get into the next IBM Z cycle in the second half of the year?\nArvind Krishna: Kyle, maybe I'll start there. In the third quarter, I think we stated, even when we finished the third quarter, that we saw a pause on some of the CapEx purchases in Infrastructure because people were digesting what to do around the Kyndryl separation. That particular factor I do not believe is going to show up again. Now that said, as Jim said a bit earlier in an answer to one of the other questions, this is the 11th quarter of mainframe. When we look at that, we do expect softness on mainframe in the first quarter but not in the remaining quarters. I'd say that that's the only critical dynamic that could be different if we look at quarter-to-quarter, but that is expected and baked in, in what we're talking about for the year and what we're talking about in terms of infrastructure performance which, for the year, we do expect it to be better in '22 but more of that in the second half, as Jim pointed out earlier.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Essex: Maybe for Arvind, some really nice business transformation technology consulting growth. And I'd love to hear your comments of -- or at least if you can reflect on customer conversations and what those have been like and how you might characterize some of that business activity, whether you feel as though we're in the early stages, maybe the middle innings of technology transformation efforts, how would you frame that business? And how much of that business is a leading indicator for Red Hat and automation growth?\nArvind Krishna: Thank you, Brian, for the question. So to go to the middle part of your comment, I would call it that we are in the early innings, not the middle or late innings, of the growth in Consulting. I wouldn't call it a very first inning, maybe the first inning was 2021, but early innings. So I think we have a long way to go on this.  Now I think that leads to the first part of yours, what are the anecdotes or what are the customer conversations that lead us there. Everyone is looking on how do you deploy technologies, be it Salesforce, Adobe, cloud technologies, to go improve their processes. It's actually the conversation has changed from 3 years ago. It's not about cost savings. It's actually much more about how can you deploy these technologies to improve a process: is it how do I do omnichannel and multichannel, is it how do I do resilience in my supply chain, is it about how do I use every warehouse and store as a point of delivery not just for physical but for physical or online commerce. As we begin to look across these topics and then as we look at the added cyber threats that come in, these do create a huge pull from clients on how do you improve the end-to-end customer experience, how do you improve the resilience of their supply chain, how do you improve the experience for employees, how do you begin to use -- I'll use the word bot because I'm a technologist, other than we use the word digital worker, that's probably a more correct word, to take care of all the upcoming -- how do you use our demographics on the skill shortage that is endemic in technology now. And that is sort of playing in. But I don't believe that the skill shortage is because of COVID. I do believe COVID may have exacerbated or created a pull-in of those demographics, but those, I think, are going to last us for the decade.  Now I think that, that is a leading indicator of automation, Red Hat cybersecurity growth, for sure. I would call it -- it's not identical, meaning you're not going to see the same percentage from one to the other, but you absolutely will see correlation that is significant between those. And when Jim talked about the number of Red Hat engagements and then we talk about the Garage engagements from Consulting, those are then proof points of that correlation. So Brian, thank you for the question. And that is, by the way, why we see a lot of our confidence in the next few years of revenue growth.  So first, Pat and Jim, thank you, guys, for answering your part of the questions. Let me now make a couple of comments to wrap up. And I'm going to end where I started the call. We've been taking actions that position our business to address attractive hybrid cloud and AI opportunity. Our fourth quarter results and expectations for 2022 are a first glimpse of today's IBM and to reinforce our confidence in our strategy and our model. I hope that all of you are as excited about our future as I am. And I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.\nPatricia Murphy: Sheila, can we turn it back to you to wrap up the call?\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our fourth quarter results reinforce our confidence in our strategy and model. With solid revenue growth, we are on track to the mid-single-digit trajectory we had laid out in our investor briefing last October.  The trend we see is clear. Across industries, clients see technology has a major source of competitive advantage. They realize that powerful technologies embedded at the heart of their business can lead to seismic shifts in the way they create value. This reality of technology being about a lot more than cost will persist and explains why clients are eager to leverage hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence to move their business forward.  Our fourth quarter results illustrates the strong client demand we see in the marketplace for our technology and consulting. IBM Consulting again had double-digit revenue growth as our ecosystem play continues to gain momentum. Software revenue growth reflects strength in Red Hat and our automation offerings. Infrastructure had a good quarter, especially with regards to IBM Z and storage.  Over the last 1.5 years, we have taken a series of actions to execute our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and improve our revenue profile, optimizing our portfolio, increasing investments, expanding our ecosystem and simplifying our go-to market. As we start to yield benefits from these actions, our constant currency performance improved through 2021.  Our most significant portfolio action was the separation of Kyndryl. You will remember we had initially expected the spin by the end of the year, and we completed it in early November. As we discuss our results, we'll focus on the new basis and structure that encompasses today's IBM. As we look to 2022, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year. Both of these are consistent with our medium-term model.  Let me now spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in the market, how we address it and the progress we are making. We are seeing high demand for our capabilities in several areas. Clients are eager to automate as many business class as possible, especially given the new employee demographics. This dynamic is likely to play out over the long term. They are also using AI and predictive capabilities to mitigate friction in their supply chains. Cybersecurity remains a major area of concern as the cost of cybercrime, already in the billions of dollars, rises each year. As clients deal with these challenges and opportunities, they are looking for a partner they can trust and who has a proven track record in bringing about strategic transformation projects. This is why our strategy is focused on helping our clients leverage the power of hybrid cloud and AI.  Hybrid cloud is about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private cloud and as-a-service properties that our clients typically have. Our approach is platform-centric, and the platform we have built is open, secure and flexible and it provides a solid base of the multiplier effect across software and services for IBM and our ecosystem partners.  It starts with Red Hat, which offers clients unique software capabilities based on open source innovation. Our software, which has been optimized for that platform, helps our clients apply AI, automation and security to transform and improve their business workflows. Our consultants deliver deep business expertise and they cocreate with our clients to advance their digital transformation journeys. And our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment.  This strategy, along with the differentiated capabilities we bring to bear to our clients, have led to an increase in platform adoption and new business opportunities across the stack. We now have more than 3,800 hybrid cloud platform clients, which is up 1,000 clients from this time last year.  IBM Consulting continues to help drive platform adoption, with about 700 Red Hat engagements for the year. Clients like Dun & Bradstreet, National Grid, AIB and Volkswagen have all recently chosen IBM's broad hybrid cloud and AI capabilities to transform their processes and move their business forward.  As I look back on the year, we had good success in broadening our ecosystem to drive platform adoption and to better respond to client needs. During our investor briefing, we talked about strategic partnerships that will yield billion-dollar businesses within IBM Consulting. As we move towards that, we had more than 50% revenue growth this year in partnerships with AWS, Azure and Salesforce. This adds to the strong strategic partnerships we have with others such as SAP, Oracle and Adobe.  We're continuing to broaden our ecosystem reach. In the fourth quarter, we announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with Salesforce to run MuleSoft integration software on Red Hat OpenShift. We also created a host of new consulting services with SAP to help clients accelerate their journey to S/4HANA. Together with Deloitte, we announced DAPPER, an AI-enabled, managed analytics solution. And we have expanded our partnership with EY to help organizations leverage hybrid cloud, AI and automation capabilities to transform HR operations. We have also recently announced a host of new strategic partnerships with Cisco, Palo Alto Networks and TELUS, all focused on the deployment of 5G, edge and network automation capabilities.  During 2021, we have been making changes to increase our focus and agility and build a stronger client-centric culture. This includes putting experiential selling, client engineering and cocreation at the heart of our client engagement model. We have completed thousands of IBM Garage engagements. And today, we have nearly 3,000 active engagements. We've invested in hundreds of customer success managers to help clients capture more value from our solutions. And we have upgraded our skills with fewer generalists and more technical specialists.  This is resonating well with our clients, and it's starting to contribute to our performance. The most important metric, of course, is revenue growth, but we are also pleased to see our client renewal rates increasing and our recurring revenue base growing. We are starting to see signs of sales productivity improvements, with average productivity per technology seller increasing from the first to the second half. At the same time, innovations that matter to our clients remain a constant focus, and our teams have worked hard to deliver a series of important innovations in the past quarter.  Starting with AI, we added new natural language processing enhancements to Watson Discovery. We're also combining and integrating products such as Turbonomic, Instana and Watson AIOps to offer a complete set of AI-powered automation software to address the significant demand. This quarter, Red Hat announced that the Ansible automation platform is now available on Microsoft Azure, bringing more flexibility to clients and how they adopt automation.  In partnership with Samsung Electronics, IBM announced a breakthrough that reorients how transistors are built upon the surface of a chip to enable tremendous increases in energy density. In Quantum, we unveiled Eagle, 127-qubit quantum processor. This is the first quantum chip that breaks the 100-cubic barrier and represents a key milestone on our path towards building a 1,000-cubit processor in 2023.  While organic innovations are important, we continue to acquire companies that complement and strengthen our portfolio. We made 5 acquisitions in the fourth quarter and a total of 15 acquisitions in 2021. 2 weeks ago, we announced the acquisition of Envizi. Many consumers are willing to pay more for products that are made by companies that are more environmentally sustainable. As the world continues to move towards a more circular economy, our clients' need is the ability to manage and measure their progress. Envizi's capabilities complement our own and help us respond to that client demand.  Sustainability is important across a number of stakeholder groups, including clients, employees and investors. We are continuing to make good progress and are particularly proud of our diversity and inclusion scores, and our ability to attract and retain talent. Our efforts were recently recognized by JUST Capital who named IBM as one of America's most just companies.  Let me now close by emphasizing once again our fourth quarter results strengthen the conviction that we have in our ability to deliver our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth.  Jim will take you through the fourth quarter and then provide more color on 2022. Jim, over to you. Thanks, Katy, for the question, and thank you for also noticing and acknowledging the robust IT spending environment. Look, Katy, I mean like if I react to every stock market intraday volatility, that's a full-time occupation. I think today showed that actually these cycles are hard to predict. And if I back up and look at our clients, I think they are not really reacting to these volatilities. We saw this in the middle of 2020 also, not just in 2021 and 2022. For the first time, despite a down business cycle in 2020, we saw people actually decide to keep up their IT spending.  Now I'll acknowledge in 2020, they did put a break on capital spending within IT, but they all acknowledge that IT spending was critical to how they would come out. And that showed up in 2021 spending, okay? So I suspect -- look, we are not as much expert on this as many of you on this call, but I would suspect that this volatility we are seeing recently will not have much of an impact. Now if it becomes into an overall bear market, correction, that would be different, but I don't think we're anywhere close to that.  I think in terms of near-term cyclical impacts, I don't really see them. Our clients tend to be people who are in much more -- what we provide technology for is much more in the critical applications. People need them for doing online payments. They need them for authorizations, reservations, retail banking, health care, telecom, within the government for critical applications. So we don't tend to see much of a short-term cyclical impact.  Now on your last question, valuations. Look, I'm always clear, valuations -- M&A has to have an economic benefit for our company and our shareholders. Has valuations come down? Certainly, some targets may become more approachable that were not previously approachable. And I've said before, look, we have a little over $20 billion of flexibility over the next 3 years. So I'll just leave it at that. That's our total flexibility. As prices come down, certainly, more things come within range. Yes. So Wamsi, thanks. Let me address the first part of the question, the mid-single-digit growth in 2022 going to 2023. Let me remind you, when we did our Investor Day in early October, we talked about the mid-single-digit growth comes from -- about 2 points of that for IBM comes from the Consulting growth, about between 1 and 2 points comes from the Red Hat growth and then we would get some from Infrastructure, aka mainframe, but there's more than mainframe. There's storage in there, and there's also power product cycles and then organic software. If you put that all together, you would get more than mid-single digit in a given year.  But we begin to see cycles of that. For example, on mainframe, when we say it comes late in the first half, that means it's really a second half '22 contribution. That carries on then into the first half of '23, maybe until the third quarter, maybe longer, depending on the cycle. If I look at Red Hat, we fully expect that to carry on. If I look at Consulting, we expect that to carry on. So if I look at all the underlying components and then as I bake in the acquisitions into software, those will begin to contribute a bit more and a bit more each year.  You asked about the overall acquisitions. I think that will give us about a point each year, which is what we had said before. But that is inside what I talked about, the 2 points and the 1 to 2 points and the point and the point. And so that is the thesis here. And by the way, so if you look at what I laid out, '22 and '23 look remarkably similar, not that different.  Jim, you want to -- the seasonality question? Jim, let me take that. This is Arvind. Look, I think that we have done a lot of the heavy lifting we need. I fundamentally believe that we have the right portfolio and we have the right focus to be delivering on our midterm model. Maybe I didn't quite understand the word harvest. I wouldn't say harvest. We have the correct portfolio to be able to grow where our clients have got demand and where the market has demand. We are now approximately a 30% consulting company, a 70% technology company. It's -- about a little bit under half is software.  If I look in software, yes, there is a portion that is very much focused on transaction processing. We believe that model is going to be a mid-single-digit decline over the very long term. And if you look at some of the dynamics that Jim Kavanaugh talked about, you kind of see that then if you go over the past couple of years. Then if I look at automation, security, data and AI, I think these play very much into where there is a lot of demand in the market. If I look at consulting, that's how clients are going to go get their projects on digital transformation completed. And then if you look at hybrid infrastructure, we are quite focused in infrastructure on the areas that align to our high-value model. And if I look at both storage and mainframe, they give us a lot of benefit to also help drive the other parts of the portfolio.  If I got it right, Jim, to your question, no, you should not expect any major strategic divestitures like we just have talked about with Kyndryl. I think those are behind us. Now we have the portfolio that allows us to deliver on our medium-term more. Kyle, maybe I'll start there. In the third quarter, I think we stated, even when we finished the third quarter, that we saw a pause on some of the CapEx purchases in Infrastructure because people were digesting what to do around the Kyndryl separation. That particular factor I do not believe is going to show up again. Now that said, as Jim said a bit earlier in an answer to one of the other questions, this is the 11th quarter of mainframe. When we look at that, we do expect softness on mainframe in the first quarter but not in the remaining quarters. I'd say that that's the only critical dynamic that could be different if we look at quarter-to-quarter, but that is expected and baked in, in what we're talking about for the year and what we're talking about in terms of infrastructure performance which, for the year, we do expect it to be better in '22 but more of that in the second half, as Jim pointed out earlier. Thank you, Brian, for the question. So to go to the middle part of your comment, I would call it that we are in the early innings, not the middle or late innings, of the growth in Consulting. I wouldn't call it a very first inning, maybe the first inning was 2021, but early innings. So I think we have a long way to go on this.

            "name": "James Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, 58% operating gross margin, operating pretax income of $3.5 billion and operating EPS of $3.35 for continuing operations.  Last January, we said we expected performance to improve over the course of 2021 as we start to benefit from the actions we've taken. We have seen progress in our constant currency revenue growth rate every quarter and now again in the fourth. This is the first view of IBM post separation.  We had solid revenue performance, up nearly 9%. I'll remind you, this includes the incremental revenue from the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl, and we said we would be transparent on the contribution to our revenue growth for the first year. This quarter, our revenue growth includes about 3.5 points from the new relationship. Excluding this, IBM's revenue was up 5%.  We have aligned our operating model and segment structure to our platform-centric approach. In the fourth quarter, Software was up 10%, and Consulting was up 16%. These are our 2 growth vectors and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue. Infrastructure, more of a value vector, tends to follow product cycles and was up 2%. The Software and Infrastructure growth each include nearly 5 points from the new Kyndryl relationship while there is no contribution to Consulting's growth.  Our platform-centric model has attractive economics. For every dollar of hybrid platform revenue, IBM and our ecosystem partners can generate $3 to $5 of software, $6 to $8 of services and $1 to $2 of infrastructure revenue. This drives IBM's hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 19% for the year. Post separation, revenue from our full stack cloud capabilities from Infrastructure up through Consulting now represents $20 billion of revenue or 35% of our total.  Looking at our P&L metrics. Our operating gross profit was up 3%, and the $3.5 billion of operating pretax profit was up over 100%. Operating net income and earnings per share also grew.  Let me highlight a couple of items within our profit performance. First, the year-to-year pretax profit reflects $1.5 billion charge to SG&A last year for structural actions to simplify and optimize our operating model and improve our go-forward position. We're continuing to invest to drive growth. Throughout the year, we have been aggressively hiring, with about 60% of our hires in Consulting. We're scaling resources in Garages, sign engineering centers and customer success managers, all to better serve our clients. We're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like Quantum. We're ramping investment in our ecosystem, and we acquired 15 companies in 2021 to provide skills and technologies aligned to our strategy, including capabilities to help win client architecture decisions.  Regarding tax, our fourth quarter operating tax rate was 14%. This was up significantly from last year but roughly 2 to 3 points lower than what we estimated in October due to a number of factors, including the actual product and geographic mix of our income in the quarter.  Let me spend a minute on our free cash flow and balance sheet position. Our full year consolidated cash from operations was $12.8 billion, and free cash flow was $6.5 billion. These are all-in consolidated results and include 10 months of Kyndryl and the cash paid for the 2020 structural actions and spin charges. IBM's stand-alone or baseline free cash flow for the year was $7.9 billion, which is aligned to our go-forward business. This excludes Kyndryl charges and pre-separation activity but includes the IBM portion of the structural actions. Payments for these IBM-related structural actions and deferred cash tax paid in 2021 contributed to the year-to-year decline in the stand-alone results.  In terms of uses of cash for the year, we invested over $3 billion in acquisitions. We continue to delever, with debt down nearly $10 billion for the year and over $21 billion since closing the Red Hat acquisition. And we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a year-end cash position of $7.6 billion, including marketable securities and debt of just under $52 billion.  Our balance sheet remains strong, and I'd say the same for our retirement-related plans. You'll remember that over the last years, we've shifted our asset base to a lower risk profile. In 2021, the combination of modest returns and higher discount rates improved the funded status of our plans. In aggregate, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 107%, with the U.S. at 112%.  Now I'll turn to the details by segment, and I'll remind you we have put in place a simplified management system and segment structure aligned to our platform-centric model. And within the segments, we're now providing new revenue categories and metrics that will provide greater transparency into business trends and drivers.  IBM Software delivered double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. This was driven by good revenue performance in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the new Kyndryl content. Software is important to our hybrid cloud strategy and our financial model. Our hybrid cloud revenue in software is up 25% for the year to more than $8.5 billion. And subscription and support renewal rates continue to grow again this quarter, contributing to a $700 million increase in the software deferred income balance over the last year. Hybrid platform and solutions revenue was up 9%. This performance is an indication of the strength across the software growth areas focused on hybrid cloud and AI. It's worth mentioning this includes only a point of help from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship.  Let me highlight some of the trends by business area. Red Hat revenue, all in, was up 21%. Both infrastructure and app dev and emerging tech grew double digits as RHEL and OpenShift address enterprise's critical hybrid cloud requirements. With this performance, we're continuing to take share with our Red Hat offerings.  Automation delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. As Arvind mentioned, there is strong market demand for automation. We had good performance in AIOps and management this quarter as we address resource management and observability. Clients are realizing rapid time to value from Instana and Turbonomic, 2 of our automation acquisitions. And integration grew with continued traction in Cloud Pak for Integration.  Data and AI revenue grew 3%. We have particular strength in data fabric, which enables clients to connect siloed data distributed across the hybrid cloud landscape without moving it. You'll recall, we talked about the data fabric opportunity back in October. We also had strong performance in business analytics and weather. Within these solutions, clients are leveraging our AI to ensure AI models are governed to operate in a fair and transparent manner.  Security revenue declined modestly in the quarter driven by lower performance in data security, while revenue grew 5% for the year. As we called out in our recent investor briefing, security innovation is an integral part of our strategy. In December, we launched a new data security solution, Guardium Insights, with further plans to modernize the broader portfolio throughout the year. This quarter, we also completed the acquisition of ReaQta, which leverages AI and machine learning to automatically identify and block threats at the end point. Putting this all together, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is now over $13 billion, which is up 8% this quarter. This demonstrates the momentum in our hybrid platform and AI strategy, including Red Hat and our suite of Cloud Paks.  Moving to transaction processing. Revenue was up 14%. This is above our model driven by a few underlying dynamics. First, all of the growth in transaction processing came from the new Kyndryl commercial relationship, which contributed more than 16 points of growth. Second, I'll remind you that we're wrapping on a very weak performance in the fourth quarter of last year, which was down 26%. And lastly, we had some large perpetual license transactions given the good expansion in the IBM Z capacity we've seen this cycle. While the new capacity is important, what's just as important is the continued strong renewal rates this quarter. These are both good proof points of our clients' commitment to our infrastructure platform and these high-value software offerings.  Looking at software profit. We expanded pretax margin by 12 points, including nearly 10 points of improvement from last year's structural actions. Turning to Consulting. Revenue grew 16% with acceleration across all 3 revenue categories. Complementing this strong revenue performance, our book-to-bill was 1.2. Clients are accelerating their business transformations powered by hybrid cloud and AI to drive innovation, increase agility and productivity and capture new growth opportunities. Enterprises are turning to IBM Consulting as their trusted partner on this journey. They are choosing us for our deep client, industry and technical expertise, which drives adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and pulls through key technologies.  Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 34% in the quarter. For the year, cloud revenue is up 32% to $8 billion. Offerings and application modernization, which are centered on Red Hat, contributed to this growth. The Red Hat-related signings more than doubled this year and are now over $4 billion since inception. This quarter, we added over 150 client engagements, bringing the total since inception to over 1,000.  Our strategic partnerships also drove our performance. Revenue from these partnerships accelerated as the year progressed and was up solid double digits in the fourth quarter led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure.  Turning to our business areas. Our Consulting's growth was led by business transformation, which was up 20%. Business transformation brings together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. To enable this, we leverage skills and capabilities in IBM technologies and with strategic ecosystem partners such as SAP, Salesforce and Adobe. Our practices are centered on areas such as finance and supply chain, talent, industry-specific solutions and digital design. This quarter, we had broad-based growth, reflecting strong demand for these solutions.  In technology consulting, revenue was up 19%. Technology consulting architects and implements cloud platforms and strategies. We leverage hybrid cloud with Red Hat OpenShift and work with providers, such as AWS and Azure, in addition to IBM Cloud. This quarter, we continue to see good performance in application modernization offerings that build cloud native applications and that modernize existing applications for the cloud.  Finally, application operations revenue grew 8%. This business line focuses on application and cloud platform services required to operationalize and run in both cloud and on-premise environments. Revenue growth was driven by offerings, which provide end-to-end management of custom applications in cloud environments.  Moving to consulting profit. Our pretax income margin expanded about 8 points, including just over 9 points from last year's structural actions. We're in a competitive labor market, and we continue to have increased pressure on labor costs due to higher acquisition, retention and wages. While we still expect to capture this value in our engagements, it will take a few quarters to appear in our profit profile.  So now turning to the new Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 2%. The Kyndryl commercial relationship contributed about 5 points of growth, which is higher than we expected in October. In this segment, we brought together hybrid infrastructure with infrastructure support, which was formerly technology support services. This allows us to better manage the life cycle of our hardware platforms and to provide end-to-end value for our clients.  Hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support revenue were up 2% and 1%, respectively, with pretty consistent contribution from the new Kyndryl relationship. Hybrid infrastructure includes IBM Z and distributed infrastructure. IBM Z revenue performance, now inclusive of both hardware and operating system, is down 4% this quarter. This is the 10th quarter of z15 availability and the combination of security, scalability and reliability continues to resonate with clients. This program continues to outpace the strong z14 program, and we ship more MIPS in the z15 program than any program in our history. Our clients are leveraging IBM Z as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. And then in distributed infrastructure, revenue was up 7% driven by pervasive strength across our storage portfolio.  Looking at infrastructure profit. The pretax margin was up over 9 points but essentially flat, normalizing for last year's structural action.  Now I'll wrap up with a discussion of how our investments and actions position us for 2022 and the longer term. We've been laser-focused on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our portfolio, our capital allocation and the moves we've been making are all designed to create value through focus for our clients, our partners, our employees and our shareholders.  We took significant steps during 2021. The most impactful portfolio action was, of course, the separation of Kyndryl. We've also been allocating capital to higher growth areas, investing in skills and innovation and expanding our ecosystem. We've aligned our business to a more platform-centric business model. And we're simplifying and redesigning our go-to-market to better meet client needs and execute on our growth agenda.  Bottom line, we're exiting 2021 a different company. We have a higher growth, higher value business mix, with over 70% of our revenue in software and services and a significant recurring revenue base dominated by software. This will result in improving revenue growth profile, higher operating margin, strong and growing free cash flow and lower capital intensity, leading to a higher return on invested capital business.  We also continue to have attractive shareholder returns through dividends. In October, we laid out a model for IBM's performance over the medium term defined as 2022 through 2024. The model is focused on our 2 most important measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. As we enter the new year, I'll talk about our expectations for 2022 performance along those dimensions.  Starting with revenue. We expect to grow revenue at mid-single-digit rate at constant currency. That's consistent with the model. On top of that, in 2022, the new commercial relationship with Kyndryl will contribute an additional 3 points of growth spread across the first 3 quarters.  Currency dynamics, unfortunately, will be a headwind. At current spot rates, currency is roughly a 2-point headwind to reported revenue growth for the year and 3 points in the first quarter.  For free cash flow, we expect to generate $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. To be clear, this is an all-in free cash flow definition. The adjusted free cash flow view we provided in 2021 was useful given the significant cash impact associated with the separation and structural actions. Now in 2022, despite the fact we still have nearly $0.5 billion of impact from the charges, we're focusing on a traditional free cash flow definition. The $10 billion to $10.5 billion reflects a year-to-year improvement driven by lower payments for the structural actions, a modest tailwind from cash taxes, working capital improvements and profit growth resulting from our higher growth and higher value business mix. With this performance, we're on track to our model.  So now let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance. Because this is a new segment structure, I'm going to spend a little more time and provide perspective on constant currency revenue growth and pretax margin in the context of our segment models.  In Software, as we benefit from the investments in innovation and our go-to-market changes, we're seeing progress in our Software growth rate. In 2022, we expect growth at the low end of the mid-single-digit model and then another 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from our external sales to Kyndryl. We expect Software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year.  We have solid momentum in IBM Consulting revenue and expect this to continue into 2022 as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and our book-to-bill ratio support revenue at the high end of our high single-digit model for the year, with double-digit growth in the first half. We expect low double-digit pretax margin for the full year with improving performance through the year as we make progress on price realization.  Infrastructure revenue performance will vary with product cycle. In 2022, with a new IBM Z introduction late in the first half, we expect performance above the model and a slight contribution to IBM's overall growth. On top of that, we're planning for about 2 to 3 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. This supports a high-teens pretax margin rate for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics will yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax operating margin for the full year and 2 to 3 points in the first quarter. In terms of tax, we expect a mid- to high teens tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth.  Bringing this all together, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth before Kyndryl and currency and $10 billion to $10.5 billion of free cash flow for the year, both in line with our midterm model.  Patricia, let's go to the Q&A. Sure. Amit, thank you very much for the question. First, let's just ground everyone because I want to make sure we have absolute clarity as we're returning to reporting all-in free cash flow to, one, align to our consistency of IBM's post-separation baseline, to your point, the $10 billion in 2020 and, more importantly, to align to our forward-looking guidance, which we talked at Investor Day, with a midterm model of $35 billion cumulatively over 2022 to 2024. For 2022 specifically, as you heard me say, we expect free cash flow to be between $10 billion and $10.5 billion all-in. And that puts us right on track for the $35 billion, mainly, Amit, because it includes still the remaining structural actions charges of about $0.5 billion in 2022. And when you look at that, because of structural actions, you're not going to have linearity in that $35 billion throughout 2022 to 2023 to 2024.  So let me talk just a little bit so we get clarity around the drivers, to your point, at the heart of your question. First, we do have about $0.5 billion remaining in the cash impacts from the structural charges, as I stated earlier. That means year-to-year, it's about $1 billion, give or take, benefit. Second, we anticipate about $0.5 billion of working capital efficiency just based on our AR dynamics around volume. And also, we're entering a mainframe cycle late in the first half. Third, very minimal tailwind with regards to cash tax, which basically means the majority of this has to be delivered on our operational profit and invest less, I should say, investments in capital expenditures. And that's going to come from revenue growth at our model, mid-single digit, before we add on Kyndryl; operating leverage, which we talked about, about 4 points improvement for the year; a mainframe cycle; and us continuing to address the remaining stranded costs from the separation of Kyndryl as we move forward.  So we feel very comfortable, one, $10 billion to $10.5 billion puts us in position to that $35 billion; and two, more importantly, that this cash provides us with ample financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically, and return significant value to our shareholders with our committed dividend. Toni, I'll take this. Thank you very much for the question. A handful there to address overall. So if I got it correctly, first of all, yes, we talked about our guidance, coming off of a very solid fourth quarter, gives us confidence in the foundation to really build on our midterm model. And we said 2022 would be the next step. We have progress, more work to do, mid-single-digit growth pre the Kyndryl contribution, operating margins up about 4 points and then free cash flow, as I answered Amit, at $10 billion to $10.5 billion.  So when you look at that operating profit overall, first of all, yes, we're very transparent in our 2 key measures of success. Number one, the contribution of revenue growth. And we said we're going to be up mid-single digit prior to adding the Kyndryl 3 points roughly for the year. And the second key measure, which we've got our entire business, our operating model, aligned to, is free cash flow generation. And we're very transparent in our free cash flow generation that, that is all-in, with a baseline -- IBM post-separation baseline of $7.9 billion we reported in '21 going to $10 billion to $10.5 billion, on its way to delivering $35 billion cumulatively over time. Within that, I gave you the breakout of the bridge on cash flow. No matter how you cut it, we are going to invest more in capital expenditures this year. But when you take out the working capital efficiency of $0.5 billion, a very modest cash tax tailwind, and you take out the $0.5 billion of structural charges, you get substantial operating profit growth.  And I would tell you, although we're not going to disclose based on commercial competitive reasons around the profitability of Kyndryl overall, and I don't think you would expect us because we don't do that with any strategic partner or client, that, that is a minimal component of the required operational profit improvement for 2022 overall. So we feel pretty good about the confidence in our guidance. It positions us on that midterm model, and it gives us tremendous financial flexibility to continue to invest, to extend our hybrid cloud leadership, invest in innovation to bring on new technology and return significant value back to our shareholders overall. I think that was the first one.  The second one, acquisition revenue contribution. Obviously, we've got work to do to close this. This won't close until later in the second quarter. And at that point in time, we will disclose information around Watson Health and what the implications are to our guidance overall, and we'll update investors as we always do. Yes. Wamsi, thank you very much. A very important question when we think about 2022, just building on what Arvind just said right there. If you think about the revenue growth profile and how it's going to play out in 2022, as we stated earlier, we expect the mainframe cycle this year, and that will happen late in the first half. So read that minimal contribution in 2Q and then mostly in the second half.  But second, really, the big point I want to get out is, you can quite expect, due to the separation of Kyndryl, which was a highly annuitized-based business, I think we're going to have a different business skew throughout 2022 on top of the product cycle that I just talked about earlier. I would expect somewhere in the neighborhood, around profit, to be about 40-60 first half, second half. But I would tell you, underneath that 40% in the first half, it's going to be skewed more towards second quarter just given the new introduction of our mainframe cycle. And also last year, we had a very strong first quarter mainframe. We grew over 20%. So we're wrapping on a GA plus 11 quarter at the end of its cycle on the most successful mainframe program we've had, program to date. We're very late in that cycle. So I would expect more of that profit to be in second quarter and again 40 to 60 first half, second half. Yes. Well, David, as we've talked, since Arvind has come on and taken over as Chairman and CEO, we have aligned our portfolio. We've aligned our capital investment allocation structure. We've aligned the operating model in this company. And I'm a very big believer in focus. And that focus is around 2 measures: revenue growth and free cash flow. So I am not going to talk about EPS guidance. And by the way, EPS, as you know quite well, there are many ways of getting to an EPS number.  But I've given the breakout of the revenue growth overall. We've been very transparent mid-single digit. We said we're going to get an operating leverage improvement of about 4 points. When we broke that out by segment, we're going to get Software, we expect, up to mid-20s on our path to approaching 30 in our midterm model. We said around Consulting at the high end of our high single-digit revenue growth model. We're going to approach about 10% coming off of about 8.5 point margin business in 2021. And then Infrastructure, given we've got a product cycle, we expect above model on revenue, as Arvind answered earlier. It'll be a slight contribution to IBM, and we expect the operating margins in Infrastructure to be in the high teens.  When you take all those components, what I just brought out, and then you do the free cash flow bridge, you get to quite healthy profit contribution to deliver that free cash flow. And I think, David, that is the focus that Arvind has got, 250,000 IBMers mobilized on revenue growth, that operating margin by segment to deliver the product mix and productivity and that free cash flow. And that's what we're going to continue to guide on as we move forward."

With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thank you Patricia. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter performance. At our recent investor briefing, laid out our Hybrid Cloud and AI strategy, and our approach to delivering strong free cash flow and sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth starting in 2022. For the last year-and-a-half, we've been taking actions and investing to execute our strategy. This quarter, we reported modest revenue growth and delivered solid free cash flow, generated over $11 billion of adjusted free cash flow over the last year. We also made tangible progress in our key growth areas of software and consulting. With that, I will acknowledge that in other areas of the business, we fell short of our expectations. This was during the end of the  cycle and global technology services clients, pausing ahead of the public filing of the Form 10 and separation of Kyndryl, have made further progress in the Kyndryl separation in the last two weeks and announced a distribution date on November 3rd, which is ahead of our original schedule. We've done a lot to prepare Kyndryl for this moment. We took structural actions to improve the private profile, the management team is in place, employee transfers and the vast majority of client contract innovations are complete. We're now even more certain that separating this business creates value through focus. That said, the people of GTS have been a part of IBM for a long time. And it is with mixed emotions that we're reporting on this segment for the last time. And just yesterday, you heard from Martin and his management team  strategy and value . The separation is just one of the many actions we are taking to focus our business on hybrid cloud and AI and improve our financial profile. To give you some color of IBM's performance excluding Kyndryl, we delivered 2% revenue growth this quarter. That compares to 1% in the second quarter and minus 1% in the first quarter. These results reflect a strong demand for technology products and services that help our clients advance their digital transformation. Our software revenue growth was led by Red Hat, security, automation and cloud backs across our software. Global Business Services, soon to be IBM Consulting, accelerated revenue growth to a double digit rate. Software and consulting are our 2 main drivers of growth, and this was certainly true this quarter. I will now expand on the progress we made in the third quarter toward our future. As I have described in the past, we have a platform - centric approach. Time to meet clients wherever they are in their journey. The platform we have built is open, secure, and flexible and continues to gain traction in the marketplace. I have more than 3500 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. Not only fueled our Red Hat revenue performance, but also provides a solid base for the multiplier effect across software and services. IBM Consulting is helping to drive this platform adoption. And this quarter had over a 180 new Red Hat engagements. Our teams work alongside our clients to co-create business products and solutions. So far we have done more than 4,000 IBM Garage engagements. In the last quarter, more clients are leveraging our platform capabilities and our expertise to unlock business value. We announced DISH is using IBM software and services to help automate their cloud-native 5G network. Cloud Pak for network automation, which is excused with AI, automation, and orchestration capabilities used by DISH to fine-tune speed levels or coverage areas depending on the needs of our clients. Building on a partnership spanning half a century, we announced Credit Mutuel is creating an IBM technology and skilled hub in France. The new hub will help Credit Mutuel leverage AI, data, cloud, and IBM Z. Also announced a new agreement with CaixaBank, one of the largest banks in Europe to put its digital capabilities with IBM Cloud for financial services and the new IBM Cloud multi zone regions in Spain. CaixaBank will leverage IBM Consulting industry expertise to move to a Hybrid Cloud approach for modernization. This quarter, we continued to leverage our ecosystem to drive what we described at our Investor Briefing as a flywheel of growth. That is, the more we grow, the more our partners grow and vice versa. We\u2019re partnering with select DSI\u2019s to bring joint solutions to market. This quarter, Atos announced the setup of the FS Cloud Center of Excellence to help financial services customers with their digital transformation journey. Also have continued momentum and revenue growth from our partnership with industry-leading ISVs and hyperscalers. Quarter, we're partnering with Adobe to help the British pharmacy chain Boots transform their e-commerce platform and deliver new digital customer experiences. While we invest in partnerships, we also invest organically and inorganically to deliver innovation. We made 16 acquisitions since April 2020, including Boxboat and Bluetab in the third quarter. These will strengthen our Hybrid Cloud consulting capabilities. In the same manner, we are organically developing new innovations that matter to our clients. I'll mention a few new introductions, starting with our innovations in software. In the quarter, Red Hat introduced a new \u2013re-architected version of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. Red Hat also launched a new version of its Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. These two products are now more tightly integrated, which helps drive hybrid cloud automation. In addition, the latest version of Red Hat OpenShift became generally available. IBM Cloud Pak runs anywhere that OpenShift runs. They use common services such as logging, metering, monitoring, and security, and are infused with innovations and capabilities from IBM Research to deliver much more value than containerized code. In this quarter, we launched Cloud Pak for security, SaaS, as well as new versions of Cloud Pak for integration, Cloud Pak for network automation, and the Maximo application suite. Also recently announced, our Environmental Intelligence software suite, a product based on our Cloud Pak for data and leveraging our weather capabilities, it's designed to help companies measure, monitor, and predict environmental outcome, but also to help simplify ESG reporting. As you know, we made a commitment to be net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We will leverage this solution to inform management as we take action to reach this goal. In our systems business, we recently launched Power 10. Power 10 has unique hardware innovations including a processor specifically optimized for data intensive workloads such as SAP S/4HANA . During the quarter, we also announced the Telum processor. This 7-nanometer microprocessor is engineered to help clients get insights from their data at the speed of the workload. At the same time, we've continued to see quantum computing as a promising area of opportunity that will play out in the longer term. Our teams are hard at work to move this exciting field forward. Investors will have an opportunity to learn more about this within the next month. Let me quickly highlight one ESG announcement we made recently. Help protect the rights and privacy of cloud clients; we have joined other major companies in the tech industry, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, and SAP to establish the trusted cloud principles. This initiative is consistent with our longstanding focus on trust and transparency. Before I transition  to Jim, let me reiterate three messages we conveyed during our investor briefing. First, we are optimizing our portfolio to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth starting in 2022. Second, we are increasing our focus and agility to better serve clients. Third, we are generating strong free cash flow that enables our investments while providing attractive shareholder returns. This quarter, we took another step towards the future. While much remains to be done, we are confident we can achieve our midterm objective. Jim, over to you.\nJames J. Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. Over the last year, we have been very clear on the two most important measures of success; revenue growth and free cash flow generation. I'll start with these key metrics. In the third quarter, our revenue of $17.6 billion was up as reported and down modestly at constant currency. Excluding the content that will go to Kyndryl, IBM\u2019s revenue grew 2% with an improving trend over the last 3 quarters. Our cash generation was up for the quarter year to date and trailing 12 months. This excludes the cash charges associated with the separation of Kyndryl and the structural actions initiated at the end of last year. Looking at our revenue from a segment perspective, Global Business Services growth accelerated to 11% and our software revenue was up 2%. Businesses will be our growth drivers into the future, and together represent over 70% of our post separation revenue profile. Systems declined this quarter by 12%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Across our segments, IBM's cloud revenue was up 11% over last year, and it's up 17% excluding the cloud revenue going to Kyndryl. This is led by global business services in cloud and cognitive software, which are up 27% and 28% respectively over that period. Moving onto the profit dynamics, pre -tax margin is up 10 basis points sequentially, but down a 100 basis points year-to-year. Since we saw the demand environment improving in the fourth quarter of last year, we have been increasing investments in skills, innovation and our ecosystem, organically, and through acquisitions. In the third quarter, we continue to aggressively hire, bringing in technical talent in Red Hat and highly skilled expertise in consulting. We're scaling resources at our Garages to provide a more experiential consulting and sales approach. We're adding client success managers to help clients get the most value out of their IBM solutions, and we're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in our Hybrid Cloud platform, AI, and emerging technologies like Quantum. The structural actions we initiated at the end of last year are funding some of these investments. Roughly two-thirds of the savings from these actions address stranded costs from the separation and create financial flexibility to be reinvested for growth. The other one-third addressed the Global Technology Services profit profile ahead of the separation, and we're seeing improvement in the GTS gross margin. Our third quarter operating tax rate came in about 5%, which is lower than what we talked about last quarter. This was due to discrete tax benefits that occurred earlier than we previously expected as we prepare for the Kyndryl separation. It's important to note that our view of the full-year operating tax rate has not changed since January. I'll comment on our free cash flow and balance sheet position. We generated $5 billion of adjusted free cash flow year to date, and $11.1 billion over the last year. Both exclude cash impacts of about $1.8 billion for the structural actions initiated late last year, and transaction charges associated with the separation of Kyndryl. Our adjusted free cash flow over the last year is up about $300 million, with growth in our underlying business performance mitigated by a cash tax headwind. Our cash balance at the end of September was $8.4 billion, up slightly from June, but down about $6 billion from year end. Over the same period, our debt is down $7 billion. Addition to debt reduction, year to date, we've used $3 billion for acquisitions and over $4 billion for shareholder returns through dividends. Our solid cash generation and disciplined financial management provide the fuel to invest in our business and pay an attractive dividend. Turning to the segments, Cloud and Cognitive Software revenue grew 2%. We have a strong recurring revenue base in Software. Renewal rates for subscription and support were up again this quarter, contributing to the increase in our Software deferred income balance over the last year. By business area, Cloud and Data platforms' revenue was up 9% while cognitive applications declined 1% and transaction processing platforms was down 9%. We recently shared plans to provide new software revenue categories starting in the fourth quarter. We will combine our two Software growth factors, Cloud and Data platforms, and cognitive applications. And within that, provide greater transparency into performance and trends by business area. Looking across these growth factors, Red Hat, security, and automation fueled revenue growth this quarter. Red Hat revenue was up 17% on a historically normalized basis and 23% all-in. Going forward, we will focus on this all-in growth, given these views will converge over the next year as the impact of the deferred revenue impairment dissipate. Red Hat revenue growth was driven by double digit growth in both infrastructure and Application Development and Emerging Technology, and we had more than 40% growth in OpenShift recurring revenue. Growth in Automation was led by key solutions like Cloud Pak for integration and Cloud Pak for business automation, as well as a strong start to our recent Instana and Turbonomic acquisition. Our data and AI revenue was down modestly. We had strengthened Cloud Pak for data, weather and Maximo, and declines in on-premise DataOps portfolio and supply chain, as it wrapped on a strong third quarter last year. Security remains a key strategic focus area as we're helping clients adopt zero trust architecture with Cloud Pak for security and X-Force services. Growth in security revenue continued this quarter, led by threat management software and services as clients respond to the evolving cyber security environment. In the spirit of transparency, I'll provide a couple additional metrics into our performance. Our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, across the software growth factors grew 7%. This is a good indication of the progress in our hybrid cloud and AI client adoption. And we now have over $8 billion in software cloud revenue over the last year, which is up 28%. Turning to our software value vector transaction processing platforms, we provide flexibility to our clients and how they purchase this mission critical software. Over the last 18 months we've seen a preference for OpEx over CapEx. This continues to pressure perpetual licenses in favor of more consumption-like models. But importantly, we again had strong renewal rates in our transaction processing platform software. This is a solid indication that clients see long-term value in these offerings. Looking at profit for the software segment, we expanded pretax margins sequentially while we continue to invest in new innovation and our ecosystem. Moving to Global Business Services, revenue growth accelerated to 11%. Even with this strong revenue performance, our book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1. Our GBS value proposition is aligned to our client's priority. We're helping our clients capture new growth opportunities and increase operational flexibility and productivity with Hybrid Cloud and AI. We leverage our incumbency, IBM technology and strategic partnerships to modernize their applications and digitally transform their businesses at scale. GBS revenue growth is led by our Cloud offering. GBS Cloud revenue now represents more than $7 billion of revenue over the last year and is up 27%. This performance reflects the continued investments we are making in our Red Hat, Microsoft, and AWS practices. As Arvind said, we added over 180 Red Hat client engagements this quarter. This contributes to total Red Hat -related signings of close to $3.5 billion since the acquisition. Within our 11% revenue growth, consulting was up 16%. There's solid demand here. We're leveraging our skills and ecosystem partners to transform our client\u2019s business processes and modernize applications based on OpenShift. Global Processing Services revenue was up 19%. Our offerings in finance, procurement, and talent and transformation all grew at double-digit rates. More and more, we're conducting consulting and BPO to transform client workflows using Hybrid Cloud and AI. Lastly, in Application Management, revenue growth accelerated to 5% off a prior year that was impacted by the pandemic. Growth this quarter was driven by management of applications in a multi-cloud environment. I'll shift to GBS profit profile where our strong revenue performance drove gross and pretax profit dollar growth. Our gross and pretax margins improved sequentially, but were down year-to-year. With the market opportunity we see, we are making conscious decisions to invest ahead of revenue. We are investing in strategic partnerships, new offerings, and practices, and integrating and scaling out our acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we are investing in skills for GBS. In the last several months, we have increased our go to market resources and scaled our practices, built around our ecosystem partners in Red Hat. With a competitive labor market, this is putting some pressure on our labor cost, including higher acquisition and retention cost, which is not yet reflected in our current pricing. We expect to capture this value in future engagement, but it will take time to appear in our margin profile. So now turning to the Systems segment, revenue performance was down 12%, driven by product cycles in IBM Z and Power, mitigated by growth in storage. In IBM Z, revenue declined 33% in the ninth quarter of z15 availability, while z15 program to date continues to exceed the strong z14 cycle, the magnitude of that overachievement has come down a couple of points this quarter. IBM Z is an enduring platform, given market needs for scalability, reliability, security, and more recently, cloud-native development. These characteristics, together with our newer flexible consumption offerings, further demonstrate the value of IBM Z platform within our Hybrid Cloud and AI strategy. Our revenue was down. Late in the quarter, we began the roll out of our next generation Power10, starting with high-end system. As always, new Power technology is introduced over time, and the mid-range and low-end Power10 systems will be available during 2022. Storage delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by demand from hyperscalers for our tape products and growth in entry level all-flash storage following our product refresh earlier this year. Looking at profit in this segment, profit margin was down, reflecting where we are in the IBM Z and Power product cycles. Now let me turn to Global Technology Services. Revenue was down 5%, which is a 1 point deceleration from last quarter. The year-to-year trajectory of revenue generated from the backlog has been improving over the last few quarters. In the first half of the year, we also had modest improvements in client based business volumes and project activity, which contributes to in-period revenue. However, this quarter, clients paused on new project activity as the separation was eminent, resulting in the revenue deceleration. At the time we decided to separate our managed infrastructure services business, we undertook a series of actions to improve the margin, profit, and cash-generation profile of the business, including a substantial charge in the fourth quarter of 2020. The results of these actions can be seen in the margin improvement over the last several quarters. In this quarter, we again expanded gross margin up a 120 basis points. Kyndryl will take this improved profit profile into the separation. I'll wrap up with a view of our progress year-to-date, and then talk about some of the fourth quarter dynamics. As we entered 2021, we laid out our expectations for the year, for our two most important measures; revenue and free cash flow. We expected to grow revenue for IBM at actual rates with underlying constant currency performance stronger in the second half than the first, we expected to grow revenue for IBM excluding Kyndryl at constant currency, and we expected to generate $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. That of course excludes the cash impacts of the Kyndryl transaction costs and the structural actions I'd mentioned earlier. We're now, we're three quarters into the year and we just completed the last full quarter of IBM on a pre-separation basis. It's a good time to take a snapshot against those objectives. Through the first three quarters, our revenue at actual rates is up 2%, our revenue growth trajectory at constant currency has been improving throughout the year. And excluding Kyndryl, our third quarter revenue was up 2% year-to-year, and our adjusted free cash flow over the last 12 months is $11.1 billion. Since the beginning of the year, we have streamlined our go-to-market. We have increased investments and closed ten acquisitions. These actions and investments will help drive revenue growth, but it takes time to fully realize the benefit. Overall, our results over the first three quarters of 2021 reflect progress we've been making toward our midterm model. During the fourth quarter, we will complete the separation of Kyndryl, which is on track for November 3rd. The fourth quarter, therefore, is a major milestone as we transition to the future IBM. Now let me provide some color on three areas for the fourth quarter. First, the revenue trajectory of the new segments. Second, I'll comment on our tax rate. And third, the impact of the separation of Kyndryl to IBM\u2019s consolidated results for November and December on an operating basis. I'll start with the revenue trajectory of our segments, as we report them in the fourth quarter. As always, I'll talk about it on a constant currency basis but I'll remind you the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen and would be a 1 to 2 point headwind to growth based on current spot rate. To provide a better view of trends, I'll focus on the growth rates before the revenue from incremental sales to Kyndryl. We see continual momentum in our growth factors of Software and Consulting. We expect our Software revenue growth rate to improve versus the third quarter and in IBM Consulting, we again expect double digit revenue growth. In infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect fairly consistent performance with the third quarter, which was a high single-digit decline. Second, tax. I mentioned that timing of discrete tax benefits occurred earlier than we previously anticipated, as we prepared for the Kyndryl separation. We still expect our full-year tax rate to be in the low teen\u2019s range, in line with what we indicated back in January. That's our all-in rate, including discrete tax items and applies a fourth quarter tax rate in the high-teens. And then finally, IBM's fourth-quarter consolidated results will reflect the Kyndryl separation. I'll frame the revenue and earnings per share implications based on the last couple of years. Kyndryl historically represented just under $5 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, with about $3.5 billion of that in November and December. At the same time, we estimate we'll get about $350 million from incremental sales in those two months from the new commercial relationship. The net impact to IBM consolidated results is a reduction of about $3 billion of revenue for November and December due to the separation. For those two months, we estimate an impact of 20 to $0.25 of earnings per share, including the new commercial relationships. At the time of separation, Kyndryl will be presented in discontinued operation, with the balance of IBM in continuing operation. We will provide a historical restatement of continuing operations before the end of the year. We are on the threshold of the future IBM; we expect to exit the fourth quarter in a position to deliver our midterm model. A mid-single-digit revenue growth and cumulative free cash flow of $35 billion in 2022 to 2024. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. I'll turn it back to Patricia.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a few items. First, several references were made today to IBM's new segment structure, which will be effective immediately prior to the Kyndryl separation. We've provided information on the new segment, scope, and naming in an article posted to our investor website at the beginning of this month. Second, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation with the schedule of the availability of recapped financial information for IBM post-separation. And finally, as always, I ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question and answer session of the conference.  Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.\nQ - Wamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. Arvind, there seems to be a lot of concerns around the actual separation in terms of potential disruptions. You noted on this call that you saw some hesitation or pause in spending. Do you feel, given the changes that you have put in place, also with sales comp, do you feel comfortable about the trajectory of the business once you get past this threshold of near-term disruption that you highlighted? And if I could, Jim, you noted about 2.5 billion one-time bump from Kyndryl in 2022. Can you maybe calibrate that number for 2021 as well? That would be helpful. Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Hey, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. Look, I'd like to be very clear. I think that any -- and I would not use the word disruption, Wamsi. I would use the word that there may be a slight pause, which is the word that I used in my prepared remarks. I think there's a slight pause and it'll be the end of third quarter, maybe the beginning of fourth quarter. We see that pause mostly in hardware and in Kyndryl itself. By the way, just to add some color, why do you say that? There has been a lot of hardware that actually does flow through Kyndryl and many people -- many of our clients think of that as being an alternate way that they have procured infrastructure in the past. It's not a surprise given the size of the relationship with all those clients that we see a pause in some of them. I think that's the complete nature of it. When I look at our pipeline, I look at our sales compensation, I look at our executive compensation, I am completely confident that this will be well behind us by the beginning of '22, meaning by January. Well behind us. And as we also get into a new product cycle on some of the hardware in the first half of '22, I think that will put it completely behind us. And so my view is that we hold firm to our ready-to and forward projections. And this is actually got no long-term or systemic issues that I see, both in the numbers, in the pipelines, and in the actual behavior of clients .\nJames J. Kavanaugh: Thanks, Wamsi. To your second question, you remember back at -- on October 4th at our Investor Day, we talked about the strong strategic relationship between IBM and Kyndryl going forward.\nWamsi Mohan: Of which I think at that time we shared about 2.5 billion of annualized business, predominantly structured around our high-value mission critical recurring revenue of software, and also some in our infrastructure segment around hardware purchases and around our infrastructure support. That was a full-year annualized view. If you look at fourth quarter, we're going to have two months\u2019 worth of that in 2021, and we estimate that that's about $350 million to $400 million overall. If you go back to what I said on October 4th, the 2022 compared to 2021, 12 months versus 2 months, is give or take about a little bit over $2 billion and that translates into the 3 points of incremental growth 1 time above our mid-single-digit model in min terms.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Wamsi. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi : Yes, thank you. And I think, Arvind, you touched on this in the first question, but perhaps let me ask it a little more directly. So this quarter, IBM grew at 1.9% for RemainCo versus a comparison of constant currency at minus 3.5%. The comparisons get about two or three points more difficult looking into next year, and you have to accelerate your growth rate to get to mid-single digit growth by two or three points. So effectively, adjusting for compares, the growth rate has to improve about five percentage points relative to what you did this quarter to hit that mid-single-digit target. Beyond a product cycle in Mainframe and the UNIX, given you talked about taking time for investments to pay off, what is going to seemingly pretty suddenly change the growth profile, adjusting for comps by potentially four or five or six points over the next few quarters? And do -- how long do you continue to expect to invest, i.e. have pressure on operating margins, particularly in Software and GBS going forward? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Thanks, Toni. I'll take the first part of that and then I'll look at Jim for the second part of the question. Toni, there's three parts of it. First, let me acknowledge, yes, our growth rates have to improve. No question about it. We are not saying we are done. There are three elements that will contribute to the growth rate, and I think a lot of what you were pointing to was towards the software growth rate, I'll say it comes from three things. 1: we are seeing improvements in our organic, meaning the software we already had. We continue to see that. We expect that that will improve the software growth rates by a few points. I won't actually say the upper  because I don't expect that the three elements I mentioned, all of them, will all return at the . So let's say 1 or 2 points from the organic growth rate. 2, we will continue to make acquisitions, but not only the ones we have made keep contributing because they are growing well into double digit growth rates, but the new ones we make will also contribute to that. Think of that to be in the same range. The third one, as we're making a lot of changes in our sales compensation as well as in the makeup of our sales team, we talk about the Garages, we talk about client success managers, leading to more experiential and more technical selling. We believe that'll drive greater deployment and hence quicker purchases in that segment. And so all of those together will contribute to a much improved growth rate in the Software segment, up to the mid-single digit. As I think you're pointing out in some of your math. I'm not going to debate is it 3, 4, or 5%. Happy to do that when we have a bit more time. And I'll pass it over to Jim for the second part of the question.\nJames J. Kavanaugh: To that point, I can't resist but go into the numbers. So let's just -- Toni, great question. Thank you very much. Let's talk about this quarter. Again, IBM, ex - Kyndryl, delivered about 2% growth. By the way, that's an accelerating trend as we talked about in prepared remarks from about flat through the first half to now growing 2%. Yes, offer an easier compare -- we acknowledge that, but let's take a look at the revenue contribution analysis of what contributed to that two points. Now I'll tie it back to what we said on October 4th, as our mid-single-digit growth rate model. We set across our 3 segments: First, we have an improving growth profile as we shift to higher value, higher growth markets, over 70% of our business in Software and in Consulting, which, by the way, also carries a higher value recurring revenue stream. That those two segments will contribute all 5 points of IBM's growth by the way, with improving operating margins, which I'll get into at the end. The infrastructure segment, which is high-value mission critical, covering our Mainframe business and infrastructure support business, was projected to be flat over time as it follows innovation cycle. So as we bring out innovation next year, we firmly believe in confidence that we're going to grow there, but over a 3 year period, that's about flat, but a significant cash generator. So you got 2 growth factors, 1 value vector, 2 delivering growth, and 1 delivering cash generation. Now let's look at how the third quarter played out. Against that 70+ % of our 2 growth factors that targeted a 5 point contribution, we delivered 4.5 points of revenue growth to IBM. We fell about a 0.5 short and that's in the software area because we'd overachieved in GBS. We have a strong book of business in GBS, now IBM Consulting, and we see that continuing to play out. We got work to do on Software but we're making underlying business performance because as you all know, you see the data, our deferred revenue tailwind dissipates over time. And we lost about a point of growth in software just due to the deferred revenue tailwind, which means that the underlying business of our proforma IBM Software continues to improve. Why do we feel confident moving forward just adding to some of the points of Arvind? Number 1, we've been 5 quarters in a row now with strong renewal rates. 80% of our software business is recurring revenue, high-value recurring revenue and you see that in our deferred income and deferred revenue balance up 800 million year-over-year. Number 2, we see nice acceleration in ARR and by the way, NRR north of 100% again for the third consecutive quarter, and we're starting to see nice acceleration in Cloud Paks. And most importantly, as we talked about 3 quarters ago, we are now starting to enter the early parts of our ELA cycle that will continue into 2022 and the first half of 2023. We feel pretty confident about the two growth factors.Where we missed is based on being on the back-end of a very successful mainframe cycle. The infrastructure segment took 2.5 points of growth away from IBM, ex - Kyndryl. So plus 4.5 points against the target of 5, we lost 2.5 points in infrastructure and that will moderate out over time as we bring new innovation. And then finally, just wrapping up on your operating margin comment, we said, entering this year, two most important measures: revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We're achieving on both of those. We said that free cash flow generation was going to be important because we needed to fuel investment in innovation and in IBM Consulting because we saw robust demand. We're playing that out consciously. We'll see that improve as we get into 2022, but we're still driving that cash. And I'll wrap up year-to-date through third quarter, growing revenue, and growing revenue ex - Kyndryl at constant currency. We're growing gross and pretax dollars. We're growing pre -tax margin and we're growing trailing 12 months pre -cash flow. So that's the model that we put in place and we feel pretty confident as we enter 2022.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Toni. Victor (ph), could we please take the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Yes, thank you. Arvind, you referenced the pauses in Kyndryl and Hardware in the quarter, but Software performance was also light of expectations, so can you talk about what drove the shortfall in Cloud and Cognitive Software and where you see opportunities for better execution within that Software business?\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Katy. Totally. Actually even Jim acknowledged that we fell maybe a half-point short of our own expectations and we could've done better. Here is where I see it doing better. First, the one that performed exactly according to what we wanted was Red Hat. Red Hat gave us 17%, which is pretty much what we wanted and expected. If I now look at our transaction processing platform, it was a little bit below what we would like because we have been saying that in a long-term model that should be more mid-single digit decliner but this quarter it was a high single-digit decliner. We think that as we get past, because that is coupled, I won't call it identical, but it is coupled to some of the infrastructure cycles, I expect that to come back starting in early '22 or maybe late in '21. Then on our category that is today called AI applications, we were minus 1%. There I would expect us to get back to mid-single-digit growth. Now you see if I put it all together, do we expect to see a tiny bit of pausing from people because of everything going on? Yes. Two, we are turning our incentive models. I spoke on it on the prior question very briefly. Our incentive models for our sales team are going to be very heavily tuned towards software going forward in '22. That I believe will result in much better performance because the only way that they will get anywhere near the target incentives are to make this up a number. That is probably for the first time that that's been true in a long, long time at IBM. So Katy, that's my view on what, happened there and how we will improve going forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Katy. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien Tsin Huang : Hey, thanks. It's good to speak to you all. I wanted to ask on the GBS side. That did accelerate double-digit revenue growth, sounds like fourth quarter, you expect that too. But it did come at a higher cost, so I'm just curious on the gross margin percentage front. I'm curious on the confidence that you can reprice to offset the higher cost of deliveries or risk that those costs could persist here, given all the demand side that you're seeing. Thank you.\nJames J. Kavanaugh: Yeah. Tien-Tsin, this is Jim. I'll take that as we move forward. As I stated earlier and Arvind commented in the prepared remarks, we do see a very robust demand environment out there. We called it as we were going through fourth quarter; we called a very conscious strategy, GBS. Now, IBM Consulting again plays a very integral role to our Hybrid Cloud platform - centric business model. Why? Because it drives scale and adoption to our platform and it also pools IBM technology, while taking advantage of the ecosystem and partnership and skill and capability. So we started aggressively adding skill, capacity, expertise, ecosystem partnerships, and scaling acquisitions. I think we just announced today our eighth GBS acquisition in the last 12 months overall. So it was a conscious strategy and we believe that that flywheel effect of GBS that turns into the multiplier of driving our platform, pulling our Software, and driving a very robust economic equation for our Ecosystem partners is essential in our long-term strategy. Now, with that said, we saw margins down 310 basis points. We saw pretax margins down a 110 basis points. Within that though, we grew gross profit dollars and we grew pretax dollars. We're about generating growth in top-line at around generating cash contribution, and GBS delivered that today. I would also mention that GBS accelerated their margins quarter-to-quarter tremendously. Pretax margins were up 5 points quarter-to-quarter, and they've been accelerating their gross margins sequentially every single quarter this year. So we delivered over 13 points of pretax margin in the third quarter and our model, as we said on October 4th, was low teens. So we feel pretty comfortable, we see a very good book of business and we continue to see in fourth quarter IBM Consulting delivering double-digit revenue growth and margin dollar and profit dollar and cash dollar contribution, while pulling our Software and Hybrid Cloud platform.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you very much. My question, since a lot of them have been answered, there's just one of them, and that is the impact of higher labor costs. No matter where you look, labor costs are going higher, and I do see that in your prepared slides, that you did give -- that your signings were up 3%. So should we think about as time rolls forward, you'll implement more labor costs that escalate and go higher or are they actually material enough that we should be modeling some adjustments into your cash flows or how should we think about that as you work through the business, because it's a pretty dynamic and fluid situation with labor costs? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Jim, great question. And by the way, I would tell you that I don't think that this year is unique. Maybe there's a touch more issues going on, but I don't think it's unique. I remember 2001 really well; I remember 2007 just before the financial crisis. This is a continuous movie in the technology industry. Now, you said the 3% signings growth. I wouldn't look at the 3%. I would look at our book-to-bill ratio, which is 1.1. And so book-to-bill gives a much better signal of what the demand is for our forward-looking revenue and demand in our IBM Consulting business. Labor has to be managed. We have a global level model. We've put people everywhere. And as Jim just mentioned in answer to the prior question, that yeah, when you do have inflation in your labor cost, there is an element of it that's going to price through for that side of the business. In all the rest of the business, actually, I'm not so worried about labor cost. I'm worried about getting the right talent, maybe, but that is always a worry that I have, and I've been paranoid that for 30 years, that's not unique. And I think it's similar to many of your businesses, Jim, not just yours, but all of your colleagues here on this call. The right talent is far more important. And while labor cost is important, in the end of the day, its maybe 15%, 20% of the total costs in expense that is critical towards the other businesses, because you can manage the rest. That answer to you is, no, it's not something that needs to be modeled in, I don't believe so. But we always have to worry about it in terms of how do we price, how do we get the labor pools, where do we put the labor pools and all of those elements.\nPatricia Murphy: Excellent. Thank you, Jim. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman, Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Hi. Many thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask first on Cloud Paks. You seem to be suggesting that this is going to be a key or one of the many enablers to drive growth. And I was hoping you could explain a little bit why Cloud Paks. Because it sounds very similar to bundling which IBM and many companies have been doing for years. So I wanted to try to understand a little bit why Cloud Paks is different from the historic bundling that IBM has been doing. And then secondly, if I could just ask Jim a question I've asked before is on software maintenance. A good quarter on ESC compares and I just wanted to get your thoughts on the durability of the software maintenance, not whether it's important, but is it, in fact, a growth category as we look out within GBS over the next two years, three years? Many thanks.\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Keith, I'll take the first part of that question on Cloud Paks. So Cloud Paks are not just bundled and they're not just containerizing Software. I'll tell you right away, if all you do is bundled Software, you'll actually get a price deflation. If all you do is containerize Software, there'll be no plus or minus. It's just a different way of delivering it. I'll take one of the Cloud Pak s to maybe use it as a quick exemplar. If I take our Cloud Pak for data, if I now turn around and tell you that whether we take some of our integration Software, whether we take a database Software like DB2, and that's all you provide through that, you're right; there's neither plus nor minus. I think it will stay where it is. However, it's not just putting those in as options. A lot of Cloud Pak for data is actually new innovation. It includes methods around data fabric, it includes methods around how do you federate data, both from public clouds and from other repositories that are probably not IBM's inside the clients on-premise environment. It contains the data catalog; it contains these ways to be able to do some computations without even moving the data. That new content added to some of the existing content, so we take advantage of our incumbency or we get lift because there is more usage overall for these technologies than there was before, is why we're so excited about Cloud Pak and it gives us both. Yes, some of it is just going to be a movement, but a lot of it is actually increased usage. And hopefully that made the example clear on how we're driving innovation into the portfolio with that one example. So Jim, I'll give it to you to address the -- I don't know whether to phrase maintenance as ARR or NRR.\nJames J. Kavanaugh: I think, Keith, and I'm interpreting your question given you applied it to GBS and we've had this discussion many quarters, appropriately so, and you're talking about Application Management Services, AMS. If I'm not answering the right question, please get back to Patricia and we can move forward from there. But AMS, as we've talked about for a handful of quarters, we got back to growth up 5%, accelerated that growth albeit, as we said in the prepared remarks, off were much easier compared during the height of the pandemic last year in third quarter. But it was up this quarter as we had growth in offerings which modernize the client's applications and as we move them to a Hybrid Cloud. We talked about our application management having a tremendous incumbency value in a Hybrid Cloud platform - centric model. Why? Because what we've seen and learned over the last two plus years after the acquisition of Red Hat, is that one, we've built up a $3.5 billion book of business around our Red Hat practice in GBS from a dead start during the acquisition, and we built that up. Of that $3.5 billion over a quart -- the three quarters of that book of business is in AMS accounts. Second, AMS or excuse me, GBS driving that flywheel effect I talked about earlier, is actually delivers over 1/3 of our cloud revenue -- Cloud Pak revenue growth each quarter. And within that, 80% are AMS accounts. So there is causality and a correlation here between our strong incumbency base, us having industry, business process knowledge, and the technical expertise to be the client's trusted partner to move them along their journey to Cloud. AMS is a very integral part. So we saw good growth, and by the way, our penetration of AMS Cloud activity. Remember we talked about in the past, this predominantly being an on - prem enterprise application concentration issue. We continue to make progress, we're about close to 40% of our AMS business is now Cloud and we're capitalizing on Red Hat, we're capitalizing on application modernization, and we're capitalizing on very strong ecosystem partnerships with SAP S/4 Hana, to name one, as we move forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Very good. Thank you, Keith. Victor, let's take one last question.\nOperator: Certainly. Our final question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you, and thanks for squeezing me in here. Just two really quick ones. First, how much, if any, of the revenue with Kyndryl is activity-based, which may be dependent on their own execution? And then secondly, Jim, you mentioned the ELA cycle starting up, I think early 2022. Perhaps you could share with us just how much of a headwind that it's been and which segments its impacted most. Thanks.\nJames J. Kavanaugh: David, thank you very much for the question. I think I'll take both and then Arvind can wrap it up here overall. First, around Kyndryl. If you go back to October 4th at the Investor Day, which we were pretty transparent, and we said we're going to continue that transparency into 2022 around the external sales with the strong strategic relationship between IBM and Kyndryl. We said about on a full-year basis, $2.5 billion give or take and in 2022, when you got 12 months versus two months in 2021, it'd be about $2 billion of incremental or about three points. Within that, David, the majority of that is in Software, and a majority of that is annuitize based high-value mission critical base recurring revenue. So if you're thinking about, do we have any deflationary impacts around that 2 plus billion dollars, on the Software side, which carries the majority of it, no. The 2nd component is we have about -- annualized about $0.5 billion with regards to our infrastructure support and hardware. On the infrastructure support, it's again, annuitized based business overall and with regards to Hardware, in our strategic relationship as we set Kyndryl up, we've given them a pretty aggressive and component of an aged inventory refresh program. So we have very little hardware purchases over probably the next 18 months to two years, given we just went through a big asset refresh. So long answer to your question, but I don't think we have a lot of impact moving forward against that. Second, around the ELA cycle. You know this quite well. It's typically a three-plus-year. The dynamics of client buying behaviors change over time but we feel very confident. The good news is here is we have a lot of headroom. We're just starting the early part of that in the fourth quarter. That will predominantly play out in 2022 and then will also extend early into 2023 as we move forward. If we look at our transactional related activity, we've been making strong performance improvement in our annuitized based business with renewal rates and our on-prem transactional business has struggled, especially during the pandemic. This will bolster that as we move forward. And most importantly, we feel confident in the investments in innovation and what we're bringing to market with our modernized and containerized Cloud Pak offerings optimized on top of our Hybrid Cloud Red Hat platform that we're good. So with that, let me turn it over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. Look -- First I'd like to thank all of you for your questions. I thought they were really getting into the details and hopefully it helped -- our answers helped you understand our business a lot better. Let me just make a couple of comments to wrap it up. I hope you took away, is that we've continued to make this progress this quarter in the key areas. Both myself and Jim highlighted them in our key areas of growth and in our value vectors as you go forward, especially looking into '23. But we'll also acknowledge that we always have more to do. Importantly, we are on the threshold of the IBM of the future and we expect to exit the year in a position that delivers on our midterm model, starting in 2022. That is the sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth and the increasing free cash flow that fuels all the investments. With that, I look forward to speaking to all of you again.\nPatricia Murphy: Arvind, thanks. Victor, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you Patricia. And thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter performance. At our recent investor briefing, laid out our Hybrid Cloud and AI strategy, and our approach to delivering strong free cash flow and sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth starting in 2022. For the last year-and-a-half, we've been taking actions and investing to execute our strategy. This quarter, we reported modest revenue growth and delivered solid free cash flow, generated over $11 billion of adjusted free cash flow over the last year. We also made tangible progress in our key growth areas of software and consulting. With that, I will acknowledge that in other areas of the business, we fell short of our expectations. This was during the end of the  cycle and global technology services clients, pausing ahead of the public filing of the Form 10 and separation of Kyndryl, have made further progress in the Kyndryl separation in the last two weeks and announced a distribution date on November 3rd, which is ahead of our original schedule. We've done a lot to prepare Kyndryl for this moment. We took structural actions to improve the private profile, the management team is in place, employee transfers and the vast majority of client contract innovations are complete. We're now even more certain that separating this business creates value through focus. That said, the people of GTS have been a part of IBM for a long time. And it is with mixed emotions that we're reporting on this segment for the last time. And just yesterday, you heard from Martin and his management team  strategy and value . The separation is just one of the many actions we are taking to focus our business on hybrid cloud and AI and improve our financial profile. To give you some color of IBM's performance excluding Kyndryl, we delivered 2% revenue growth this quarter. That compares to 1% in the second quarter and minus 1% in the first quarter. These results reflect a strong demand for technology products and services that help our clients advance their digital transformation. Our software revenue growth was led by Red Hat, security, automation and cloud backs across our software. Global Business Services, soon to be IBM Consulting, accelerated revenue growth to a double digit rate. Software and consulting are our 2 main drivers of growth, and this was certainly true this quarter. I will now expand on the progress we made in the third quarter toward our future. As I have described in the past, we have a platform - centric approach. Time to meet clients wherever they are in their journey. The platform we have built is open, secure, and flexible and continues to gain traction in the marketplace. I have more than 3500 clients using our hybrid cloud platform. Not only fueled our Red Hat revenue performance, but also provides a solid base for the multiplier effect across software and services. IBM Consulting is helping to drive this platform adoption. And this quarter had over a 180 new Red Hat engagements. Our teams work alongside our clients to co-create business products and solutions. So far we have done more than 4,000 IBM Garage engagements. In the last quarter, more clients are leveraging our platform capabilities and our expertise to unlock business value. We announced DISH is using IBM software and services to help automate their cloud-native 5G network. Cloud Pak for network automation, which is excused with AI, automation, and orchestration capabilities used by DISH to fine-tune speed levels or coverage areas depending on the needs of our clients. Building on a partnership spanning half a century, we announced Credit Mutuel is creating an IBM technology and skilled hub in France. The new hub will help Credit Mutuel leverage AI, data, cloud, and IBM Z. Also announced a new agreement with CaixaBank, one of the largest banks in Europe to put its digital capabilities with IBM Cloud for financial services and the new IBM Cloud multi zone regions in Spain. CaixaBank will leverage IBM Consulting industry expertise to move to a Hybrid Cloud approach for modernization. This quarter, we continued to leverage our ecosystem to drive what we described at our Investor Briefing as a flywheel of growth. That is, the more we grow, the more our partners grow and vice versa. We're partnering with select DSI's to bring joint solutions to market. This quarter, Atos announced the setup of the FS Cloud Center of Excellence to help financial services customers with their digital transformation journey. Also have continued momentum and revenue growth from our partnership with industry-leading ISVs and hyperscalers. Quarter, we're partnering with Adobe to help the British pharmacy chain Boots transform their e-commerce platform and deliver new digital customer experiences. While we invest in partnerships, we also invest organically and inorganically to deliver innovation. We made 16 acquisitions since April 2020, including Boxboat and Bluetab in the third quarter. These will strengthen our Hybrid Cloud consulting capabilities. In the same manner, we are organically developing new innovations that matter to our clients. I'll mention a few new introductions, starting with our innovations in software. In the quarter, Red Hat introduced a new \u2013re-architected version of the Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. Red Hat also launched a new version of its Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. These two products are now more tightly integrated, which helps drive hybrid cloud automation. In addition, the latest version of Red Hat OpenShift became generally available. IBM Cloud Pak runs anywhere that OpenShift runs. They use common services such as logging, metering, monitoring, and security, and are infused with innovations and capabilities from IBM Research to deliver much more value than containerized code. In this quarter, we launched Cloud Pak for security, SaaS, as well as new versions of Cloud Pak for integration, Cloud Pak for network automation, and the Maximo application suite. Also recently announced, our Environmental Intelligence software suite, a product based on our Cloud Pak for data and leveraging our weather capabilities, it's designed to help companies measure, monitor, and predict environmental outcome, but also to help simplify ESG reporting. As you know, we made a commitment to be net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. We will leverage this solution to inform management as we take action to reach this goal. In our systems business, we recently launched Power 10. Power 10 has unique hardware innovations including a processor specifically optimized for data intensive workloads such as SAP S/4HANA . During the quarter, we also announced the Telum processor. This 7-nanometer microprocessor is engineered to help clients get insights from their data at the speed of the workload. At the same time, we've continued to see quantum computing as a promising area of opportunity that will play out in the longer term. Our teams are hard at work to move this exciting field forward. Investors will have an opportunity to learn more about this within the next month. Let me quickly highlight one ESG announcement we made recently. Help protect the rights and privacy of cloud clients; we have joined other major companies in the tech industry, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, and SAP to establish the trusted cloud principles. This initiative is consistent with our longstanding focus on trust and transparency. Before I transition  to Jim, let me reiterate three messages we conveyed during our investor briefing. First, we are optimizing our portfolio to drive mid-single-digit revenue growth starting in 2022. Second, we are increasing our focus and agility to better serve clients. Third, we are generating strong free cash flow that enables our investments while providing attractive shareholder returns. This quarter, we took another step towards the future. While much remains to be done, we are confident we can achieve our midterm objective. Jim, over to you. Hey, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. Look, I'd like to be very clear. I think that any -- and I would not use the word disruption, Wamsi. I would use the word that there may be a slight pause, which is the word that I used in my prepared remarks. I think there's a slight pause and it'll be the end of third quarter, maybe the beginning of fourth quarter. We see that pause mostly in hardware and in Kyndryl itself. By the way, just to add some color, why do you say that? There has been a lot of hardware that actually does flow through Kyndryl and many people -- many of our clients think of that as being an alternate way that they have procured infrastructure in the past. It's not a surprise given the size of the relationship with all those clients that we see a pause in some of them. I think that's the complete nature of it. When I look at our pipeline, I look at our sales compensation, I look at our executive compensation, I am completely confident that this will be well behind us by the beginning of '22, meaning by January. Well behind us. And as we also get into a new product cycle on some of the hardware in the first half of '22, I think that will put it completely behind us. And so my view is that we hold firm to our ready-to and forward projections. And this is actually got no long-term or systemic issues that I see, both in the numbers, in the pipelines, and in the actual behavior of clients . Okay. Thanks, Toni. I'll take the first part of that and then I'll look at Jim for the second part of the question. Toni, there's three parts of it. First, let me acknowledge, yes, our growth rates have to improve. No question about it. We are not saying we are done. There are three elements that will contribute to the growth rate, and I think a lot of what you were pointing to was towards the software growth rate, I'll say it comes from three things. 1: we are seeing improvements in our organic, meaning the software we already had. We continue to see that. We expect that that will improve the software growth rates by a few points. I won't actually say the upper  because I don't expect that the three elements I mentioned, all of them, will all return at the . So let's say 1 or 2 points from the organic growth rate. 2, we will continue to make acquisitions, but not only the ones we have made keep contributing because they are growing well into double digit growth rates, but the new ones we make will also contribute to that. Think of that to be in the same range. The third one, as we're making a lot of changes in our sales compensation as well as in the makeup of our sales team, we talk about the Garages, we talk about client success managers, leading to more experiential and more technical selling. We believe that'll drive greater deployment and hence quicker purchases in that segment. And so all of those together will contribute to a much improved growth rate in the Software segment, up to the mid-single digit. As I think you're pointing out in some of your math. I'm not going to debate is it 3, 4, or 5%. Happy to do that when we have a bit more time. And I'll pass it over to Jim for the second part of the question. Thanks, Katy. Totally. Actually even Jim acknowledged that we fell maybe a half-point short of our own expectations and we could've done better. Here is where I see it doing better. First, the one that performed exactly according to what we wanted was Red Hat. Red Hat gave us 17%, which is pretty much what we wanted and expected. If I now look at our transaction processing platform, it was a little bit below what we would like because we have been saying that in a long-term model that should be more mid-single digit decliner but this quarter it was a high single-digit decliner. We think that as we get past, because that is coupled, I won't call it identical, but it is coupled to some of the infrastructure cycles, I expect that to come back starting in early '22 or maybe late in '21. Then on our category that is today called AI applications, we were minus 1%. There I would expect us to get back to mid-single-digit growth. Now you see if I put it all together, do we expect to see a tiny bit of pausing from people because of everything going on? Yes. Two, we are turning our incentive models. I spoke on it on the prior question very briefly. Our incentive models for our sales team are going to be very heavily tuned towards software going forward in '22. That I believe will result in much better performance because the only way that they will get anywhere near the target incentives are to make this up a number. That is probably for the first time that that's been true in a long, long time at IBM. So Katy, that's my view on what, happened there and how we will improve going forward. Jim, great question. And by the way, I would tell you that I don't think that this year is unique. Maybe there's a touch more issues going on, but I don't think it's unique. I remember 2001 really well; I remember 2007 just before the financial crisis. This is a continuous movie in the technology industry. Now, you said the 3% signings growth. I wouldn't look at the 3%. I would look at our book-to-bill ratio, which is 1.1. And so book-to-bill gives a much better signal of what the demand is for our forward-looking revenue and demand in our IBM Consulting business. Labor has to be managed. We have a global level model. We've put people everywhere. And as Jim just mentioned in answer to the prior question, that yeah, when you do have inflation in your labor cost, there is an element of it that's going to price through for that side of the business. In all the rest of the business, actually, I'm not so worried about labor cost. I'm worried about getting the right talent, maybe, but that is always a worry that I have, and I've been paranoid that for 30 years, that's not unique. And I think it's similar to many of your businesses, Jim, not just yours, but all of your colleagues here on this call. The right talent is far more important. And while labor cost is important, in the end of the day, its maybe 15%, 20% of the total costs in expense that is critical towards the other businesses, because you can manage the rest. That answer to you is, no, it's not something that needs to be modeled in, I don't believe so. But we always have to worry about it in terms of how do we price, how do we get the labor pools, where do we put the labor pools and all of those elements. Okay. Keith, I'll take the first part of that question on Cloud Paks. So Cloud Paks are not just bundled and they're not just containerizing Software. I'll tell you right away, if all you do is bundled Software, you'll actually get a price deflation. If all you do is containerize Software, there'll be no plus or minus. It's just a different way of delivering it. I'll take one of the Cloud Pak s to maybe use it as a quick exemplar. If I take our Cloud Pak for data, if I now turn around and tell you that whether we take some of our integration Software, whether we take a database Software like DB2, and that's all you provide through that, you're right; there's neither plus nor minus. I think it will stay where it is. However, it's not just putting those in as options. A lot of Cloud Pak for data is actually new innovation. It includes methods around data fabric, it includes methods around how do you federate data, both from public clouds and from other repositories that are probably not IBM's inside the clients on-premise environment. It contains the data catalog; it contains these ways to be able to do some computations without even moving the data. That new content added to some of the existing content, so we take advantage of our incumbency or we get lift because there is more usage overall for these technologies than there was before, is why we're so excited about Cloud Pak and it gives us both. Yes, some of it is just going to be a movement, but a lot of it is actually increased usage. And hopefully that made the example clear on how we're driving innovation into the portfolio with that one example. So Jim, I'll give it to you to address the -- I don't know whether to phrase maintenance as ARR or NRR. Thanks, Jim. Look -- First I'd like to thank all of you for your questions. I thought they were really getting into the details and hopefully it helped -- our answers helped you understand our business a lot better. Let me just make a couple of comments to wrap it up. I hope you took away, is that we've continued to make this progress this quarter in the key areas. Both myself and Jim highlighted them in our key areas of growth and in our value vectors as you go forward, especially looking into '23. But we'll also acknowledge that we always have more to do. Importantly, we are on the threshold of the IBM of the future and we expect to exit the year in a position that delivers on our midterm model, starting in 2022. That is the sustainable mid-single-digit revenue growth and the increasing free cash flow that fuels all the investments. With that, I look forward to speaking to all of you again."

            "name": "James J. Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Patricia Murphy \u2013 Vice President-Investor Relations Thanks, Arvind. Over the last year, we have been very clear on the two most important measures of success; revenue growth and free cash flow generation. I'll start with these key metrics. In the third quarter, our revenue of $17.6 billion was up as reported and down modestly at constant currency. Excluding the content that will go to Kyndryl, IBM's revenue grew 2% with an improving trend over the last 3 quarters. Our cash generation was up for the quarter year to date and trailing 12 months. This excludes the cash charges associated with the separation of Kyndryl and the structural actions initiated at the end of last year. Looking at our revenue from a segment perspective, Global Business Services growth accelerated to 11% and our software revenue was up 2%. Businesses will be our growth drivers into the future, and together represent over 70% of our post separation revenue profile. Systems declined this quarter by 12%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Across our segments, IBM's cloud revenue was up 11% over last year, and it's up 17% excluding the cloud revenue going to Kyndryl. This is led by global business services in cloud and cognitive software, which are up 27% and 28% respectively over that period. Moving onto the profit dynamics, pre -tax margin is up 10 basis points sequentially, but down a 100 basis points year-to-year. Since we saw the demand environment improving in the fourth quarter of last year, we have been increasing investments in skills, innovation and our ecosystem, organically, and through acquisitions. In the third quarter, we continue to aggressively hire, bringing in technical talent in Red Hat and highly skilled expertise in consulting. We're scaling resources at our Garages to provide a more experiential consulting and sales approach. We're adding client success managers to help clients get the most value out of their IBM solutions, and we're increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in our Hybrid Cloud platform, AI, and emerging technologies like Quantum. The structural actions we initiated at the end of last year are funding some of these investments. Roughly two-thirds of the savings from these actions address stranded costs from the separation and create financial flexibility to be reinvested for growth. The other one-third addressed the Global Technology Services profit profile ahead of the separation, and we're seeing improvement in the GTS gross margin. Our third quarter operating tax rate came in about 5%, which is lower than what we talked about last quarter. This was due to discrete tax benefits that occurred earlier than we previously expected as we prepare for the Kyndryl separation. It's important to note that our view of the full-year operating tax rate has not changed since January. I'll comment on our free cash flow and balance sheet position. We generated $5 billion of adjusted free cash flow year to date, and $11.1 billion over the last year. Both exclude cash impacts of about $1.8 billion for the structural actions initiated late last year, and transaction charges associated with the separation of Kyndryl. Our adjusted free cash flow over the last year is up about $300 million, with growth in our underlying business performance mitigated by a cash tax headwind. Our cash balance at the end of September was $8.4 billion, up slightly from June, but down about $6 billion from year end. Over the same period, our debt is down $7 billion. Addition to debt reduction, year to date, we've used $3 billion for acquisitions and over $4 billion for shareholder returns through dividends. Our solid cash generation and disciplined financial management provide the fuel to invest in our business and pay an attractive dividend. Turning to the segments, Cloud and Cognitive Software revenue grew 2%. We have a strong recurring revenue base in Software. Renewal rates for subscription and support were up again this quarter, contributing to the increase in our Software deferred income balance over the last year. By business area, Cloud and Data platforms' revenue was up 9% while cognitive applications declined 1% and transaction processing platforms was down 9%. We recently shared plans to provide new software revenue categories starting in the fourth quarter. We will combine our two Software growth factors, Cloud and Data platforms, and cognitive applications. And within that, provide greater transparency into performance and trends by business area. Looking across these growth factors, Red Hat, security, and automation fueled revenue growth this quarter. Red Hat revenue was up 17% on a historically normalized basis and 23% all-in. Going forward, we will focus on this all-in growth, given these views will converge over the next year as the impact of the deferred revenue impairment dissipate. Red Hat revenue growth was driven by double digit growth in both infrastructure and Application Development and Emerging Technology, and we had more than 40% growth in OpenShift recurring revenue. Growth in Automation was led by key solutions like Cloud Pak for integration and Cloud Pak for business automation, as well as a strong start to our recent Instana and Turbonomic acquisition. Our data and AI revenue was down modestly. We had strengthened Cloud Pak for data, weather and Maximo, and declines in on-premise DataOps portfolio and supply chain, as it wrapped on a strong third quarter last year. Security remains a key strategic focus area as we're helping clients adopt zero trust architecture with Cloud Pak for security and X-Force services. Growth in security revenue continued this quarter, led by threat management software and services as clients respond to the evolving cyber security environment. In the spirit of transparency, I'll provide a couple additional metrics into our performance. Our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, across the software growth factors grew 7%. This is a good indication of the progress in our hybrid cloud and AI client adoption. And we now have over $8 billion in software cloud revenue over the last year, which is up 28%. Turning to our software value vector transaction processing platforms, we provide flexibility to our clients and how they purchase this mission critical software. Over the last 18 months we've seen a preference for OpEx over CapEx. This continues to pressure perpetual licenses in favor of more consumption-like models. But importantly, we again had strong renewal rates in our transaction processing platform software. This is a solid indication that clients see long-term value in these offerings. Looking at profit for the software segment, we expanded pretax margins sequentially while we continue to invest in new innovation and our ecosystem. Moving to Global Business Services, revenue growth accelerated to 11%. Even with this strong revenue performance, our book-to-bill ratio was greater than 1. Our GBS value proposition is aligned to our client's priority. We're helping our clients capture new growth opportunities and increase operational flexibility and productivity with Hybrid Cloud and AI. We leverage our incumbency, IBM technology and strategic partnerships to modernize their applications and digitally transform their businesses at scale. GBS revenue growth is led by our Cloud offering. GBS Cloud revenue now represents more than $7 billion of revenue over the last year and is up 27%. This performance reflects the continued investments we are making in our Red Hat, Microsoft, and AWS practices. As Arvind said, we added over 180 Red Hat client engagements this quarter. This contributes to total Red Hat -related signings of close to $3.5 billion since the acquisition. Within our 11% revenue growth, consulting was up 16%. There's solid demand here. We're leveraging our skills and ecosystem partners to transform our client's business processes and modernize applications based on OpenShift. Global Processing Services revenue was up 19%. Our offerings in finance, procurement, and talent and transformation all grew at double-digit rates. More and more, we're conducting consulting and BPO to transform client workflows using Hybrid Cloud and AI. Lastly, in Application Management, revenue growth accelerated to 5% off a prior year that was impacted by the pandemic. Growth this quarter was driven by management of applications in a multi-cloud environment. I'll shift to GBS profit profile where our strong revenue performance drove gross and pretax profit dollar growth. Our gross and pretax margins improved sequentially, but were down year-to-year. With the market opportunity we see, we are making conscious decisions to invest ahead of revenue. We are investing in strategic partnerships, new offerings, and practices, and integrating and scaling out our acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, we are investing in skills for GBS. In the last several months, we have increased our go to market resources and scaled our practices, built around our ecosystem partners in Red Hat. With a competitive labor market, this is putting some pressure on our labor cost, including higher acquisition and retention cost, which is not yet reflected in our current pricing. We expect to capture this value in future engagement, but it will take time to appear in our margin profile. So now turning to the Systems segment, revenue performance was down 12%, driven by product cycles in IBM Z and Power, mitigated by growth in storage. In IBM Z, revenue declined 33% in the ninth quarter of z15 availability, while z15 program to date continues to exceed the strong z14 cycle, the magnitude of that overachievement has come down a couple of points this quarter. IBM Z is an enduring platform, given market needs for scalability, reliability, security, and more recently, cloud-native development. These characteristics, together with our newer flexible consumption offerings, further demonstrate the value of IBM Z platform within our Hybrid Cloud and AI strategy. Our revenue was down. Late in the quarter, we began the roll out of our next generation Power10, starting with high-end system. As always, new Power technology is introduced over time, and the mid-range and low-end Power10 systems will be available during 2022. Storage delivered 11% revenue growth, driven by demand from hyperscalers for our tape products and growth in entry level all-flash storage following our product refresh earlier this year. Looking at profit in this segment, profit margin was down, reflecting where we are in the IBM Z and Power product cycles. Now let me turn to Global Technology Services. Revenue was down 5%, which is a 1 point deceleration from last quarter. The year-to-year trajectory of revenue generated from the backlog has been improving over the last few quarters. In the first half of the year, we also had modest improvements in client based business volumes and project activity, which contributes to in-period revenue. However, this quarter, clients paused on new project activity as the separation was eminent, resulting in the revenue deceleration. At the time we decided to separate our managed infrastructure services business, we undertook a series of actions to improve the margin, profit, and cash-generation profile of the business, including a substantial charge in the fourth quarter of 2020. The results of these actions can be seen in the margin improvement over the last several quarters. In this quarter, we again expanded gross margin up a 120 basis points. Kyndryl will take this improved profit profile into the separation. I'll wrap up with a view of our progress year-to-date, and then talk about some of the fourth quarter dynamics. As we entered 2021, we laid out our expectations for the year, for our two most important measures; revenue and free cash flow. We expected to grow revenue for IBM at actual rates with underlying constant currency performance stronger in the second half than the first, we expected to grow revenue for IBM excluding Kyndryl at constant currency, and we expected to generate $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. That of course excludes the cash impacts of the Kyndryl transaction costs and the structural actions I'd mentioned earlier. We're now, we're three quarters into the year and we just completed the last full quarter of IBM on a pre-separation basis. It's a good time to take a snapshot against those objectives. Through the first three quarters, our revenue at actual rates is up 2%, our revenue growth trajectory at constant currency has been improving throughout the year. And excluding Kyndryl, our third quarter revenue was up 2% year-to-year, and our adjusted free cash flow over the last 12 months is $11.1 billion. Since the beginning of the year, we have streamlined our go-to-market. We have increased investments and closed ten acquisitions. These actions and investments will help drive revenue growth, but it takes time to fully realize the benefit. Overall, our results over the first three quarters of 2021 reflect progress we've been making toward our midterm model. During the fourth quarter, we will complete the separation of Kyndryl, which is on track for November 3rd. The fourth quarter, therefore, is a major milestone as we transition to the future IBM. Now let me provide some color on three areas for the fourth quarter. First, the revenue trajectory of the new segments. Second, I'll comment on our tax rate. And third, the impact of the separation of Kyndryl to IBM's consolidated results for November and December on an operating basis. I'll start with the revenue trajectory of our segments, as we report them in the fourth quarter. As always, I'll talk about it on a constant currency basis but I'll remind you the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen and would be a 1 to 2 point headwind to growth based on current spot rate. To provide a better view of trends, I'll focus on the growth rates before the revenue from incremental sales to Kyndryl. We see continual momentum in our growth factors of Software and Consulting. We expect our Software revenue growth rate to improve versus the third quarter and in IBM Consulting, we again expect double digit revenue growth. In infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect fairly consistent performance with the third quarter, which was a high single-digit decline. Second, tax. I mentioned that timing of discrete tax benefits occurred earlier than we previously anticipated, as we prepared for the Kyndryl separation. We still expect our full-year tax rate to be in the low teen's range, in line with what we indicated back in January. That's our all-in rate, including discrete tax items and applies a fourth quarter tax rate in the high-teens. And then finally, IBM's fourth-quarter consolidated results will reflect the Kyndryl separation. I'll frame the revenue and earnings per share implications based on the last couple of years. Kyndryl historically represented just under $5 billion of revenue in the fourth quarter, with about $3.5 billion of that in November and December. At the same time, we estimate we'll get about $350 million from incremental sales in those two months from the new commercial relationship. The net impact to IBM consolidated results is a reduction of about $3 billion of revenue for November and December due to the separation. For those two months, we estimate an impact of 20 to $0.25 of earnings per share, including the new commercial relationships. At the time of separation, Kyndryl will be presented in discontinued operation, with the balance of IBM in continuing operation. We will provide a historical restatement of continuing operations before the end of the year. We are on the threshold of the future IBM; we expect to exit the fourth quarter in a position to deliver our midterm model. A mid-single-digit revenue growth and cumulative free cash flow of $35 billion in 2022 to 2024. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions. I'll turn it back to Patricia. Thanks, Wamsi. To your second question, you remember back at -- on October 4th at our Investor Day, we talked about the strong strategic relationship between IBM and Kyndryl going forward. To that point, I can't resist but go into the numbers. So let's just -- Toni, great question. Thank you very much. Let's talk about this quarter. Again, IBM, ex - Kyndryl, delivered about 2% growth. By the way, that's an accelerating trend as we talked about in prepared remarks from about flat through the first half to now growing 2%. Yes, offer an easier compare -- we acknowledge that, but let's take a look at the revenue contribution analysis of what contributed to that two points. Now I'll tie it back to what we said on October 4th, as our mid-single-digit growth rate model. We set across our 3 segments: First, we have an improving growth profile as we shift to higher value, higher growth markets, over 70% of our business in Software and in Consulting, which, by the way, also carries a higher value recurring revenue stream. That those two segments will contribute all 5 points of IBM's growth by the way, with improving operating margins, which I'll get into at the end. The infrastructure segment, which is high-value mission critical, covering our Mainframe business and infrastructure support business, was projected to be flat over time as it follows innovation cycle. So as we bring out innovation next year, we firmly believe in confidence that we're going to grow there, but over a 3 year period, that's about flat, but a significant cash generator. So you got 2 growth factors, 1 value vector, 2 delivering growth, and 1 delivering cash generation. Now let's look at how the third quarter played out. Against that 70+ % of our 2 growth factors that targeted a 5 point contribution, we delivered 4.5 points of revenue growth to IBM. We fell about a 0.5 short and that's in the software area because we'd overachieved in GBS. We have a strong book of business in GBS, now IBM Consulting, and we see that continuing to play out. We got work to do on Software but we're making underlying business performance because as you all know, you see the data, our deferred revenue tailwind dissipates over time. And we lost about a point of growth in software just due to the deferred revenue tailwind, which means that the underlying business of our proforma IBM Software continues to improve. Why do we feel confident moving forward just adding to some of the points of Arvind? Number 1, we've been 5 quarters in a row now with strong renewal rates. 80% of our software business is recurring revenue, high-value recurring revenue and you see that in our deferred income and deferred revenue balance up 800 million year-over-year. Number 2, we see nice acceleration in ARR and by the way, NRR north of 100% again for the third consecutive quarter, and we're starting to see nice acceleration in Cloud Paks. And most importantly, as we talked about 3 quarters ago, we are now starting to enter the early parts of our ELA cycle that will continue into 2022 and the first half of 2023. We feel pretty confident about the two growth factors.Where we missed is based on being on the back-end of a very successful mainframe cycle. The infrastructure segment took 2.5 points of growth away from IBM, ex - Kyndryl. So plus 4.5 points against the target of 5, we lost 2.5 points in infrastructure and that will moderate out over time as we bring new innovation. And then finally, just wrapping up on your operating margin comment, we said, entering this year, two most important measures: revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We're achieving on both of those. We said that free cash flow generation was going to be important because we needed to fuel investment in innovation and in IBM Consulting because we saw robust demand. We're playing that out consciously. We'll see that improve as we get into 2022, but we're still driving that cash. And I'll wrap up year-to-date through third quarter, growing revenue, and growing revenue ex - Kyndryl at constant currency. We're growing gross and pretax dollars. We're growing pre -tax margin and we're growing trailing 12 months pre -cash flow. So that's the model that we put in place and we feel pretty confident as we enter 2022. Yeah. Tien-Tsin, this is Jim. I'll take that as we move forward. As I stated earlier and Arvind commented in the prepared remarks, we do see a very robust demand environment out there. We called it as we were going through fourth quarter; we called a very conscious strategy, GBS. Now, IBM Consulting again plays a very integral role to our Hybrid Cloud platform - centric business model. Why? Because it drives scale and adoption to our platform and it also pools IBM technology, while taking advantage of the ecosystem and partnership and skill and capability. So we started aggressively adding skill, capacity, expertise, ecosystem partnerships, and scaling acquisitions. I think we just announced today our eighth GBS acquisition in the last 12 months overall. So it was a conscious strategy and we believe that that flywheel effect of GBS that turns into the multiplier of driving our platform, pulling our Software, and driving a very robust economic equation for our Ecosystem partners is essential in our long-term strategy. Now, with that said, we saw margins down 310 basis points. We saw pretax margins down a 110 basis points. Within that though, we grew gross profit dollars and we grew pretax dollars. We're about generating growth in top-line at around generating cash contribution, and GBS delivered that today. I would also mention that GBS accelerated their margins quarter-to-quarter tremendously. Pretax margins were up 5 points quarter-to-quarter, and they've been accelerating their gross margins sequentially every single quarter this year. So we delivered over 13 points of pretax margin in the third quarter and our model, as we said on October 4th, was low teens. So we feel pretty comfortable, we see a very good book of business and we continue to see in fourth quarter IBM Consulting delivering double-digit revenue growth and margin dollar and profit dollar and cash dollar contribution, while pulling our Software and Hybrid Cloud platform. I think, Keith, and I'm interpreting your question given you applied it to GBS and we've had this discussion many quarters, appropriately so, and you're talking about Application Management Services, AMS. If I'm not answering the right question, please get back to Patricia and we can move forward from there. But AMS, as we've talked about for a handful of quarters, we got back to growth up 5%, accelerated that growth albeit, as we said in the prepared remarks, off were much easier compared during the height of the pandemic last year in third quarter. But it was up this quarter as we had growth in offerings which modernize the client's applications and as we move them to a Hybrid Cloud. We talked about our application management having a tremendous incumbency value in a Hybrid Cloud platform - centric model. Why? Because what we've seen and learned over the last two plus years after the acquisition of Red Hat, is that one, we've built up a $3.5 billion book of business around our Red Hat practice in GBS from a dead start during the acquisition, and we built that up. Of that $3.5 billion over a quart -- the three quarters of that book of business is in AMS accounts. Second, AMS or excuse me, GBS driving that flywheel effect I talked about earlier, is actually delivers over 1/3 of our cloud revenue -- Cloud Pak revenue growth each quarter. And within that, 80% are AMS accounts. So there is causality and a correlation here between our strong incumbency base, us having industry, business process knowledge, and the technical expertise to be the client's trusted partner to move them along their journey to Cloud. AMS is a very integral part. So we saw good growth, and by the way, our penetration of AMS Cloud activity. Remember we talked about in the past, this predominantly being an on - prem enterprise application concentration issue. We continue to make progress, we're about close to 40% of our AMS business is now Cloud and we're capitalizing on Red Hat, we're capitalizing on application modernization, and we're capitalizing on very strong ecosystem partnerships with SAP S/4 Hana, to name one, as we move forward. David, thank you very much for the question. I think I'll take both and then Arvind can wrap it up here overall. First, around Kyndryl. If you go back to October 4th at the Investor Day, which we were pretty transparent, and we said we're going to continue that transparency into 2022 around the external sales with the strong strategic relationship between IBM and Kyndryl. We said about on a full-year basis, $2.5 billion give or take and in 2022, when you got 12 months versus two months in 2021, it'd be about $2 billion of incremental or about three points. Within that, David, the majority of that is in Software, and a majority of that is annuitize based high-value mission critical base recurring revenue. So if you're thinking about, do we have any deflationary impacts around that 2 plus billion dollars, on the Software side, which carries the majority of it, no. The 2nd component is we have about -- annualized about $0.5 billion with regards to our infrastructure support and hardware. On the infrastructure support, it's again, annuitized based business overall and with regards to Hardware, in our strategic relationship as we set Kyndryl up, we've given them a pretty aggressive and component of an aged inventory refresh program. So we have very little hardware purchases over probably the next 18 months to two years, given we just went through a big asset refresh. So long answer to your question, but I don't think we have a lot of impact moving forward against that. Second, around the ELA cycle. You know this quite well. It's typically a three-plus-year. The dynamics of client buying behaviors change over time but we feel very confident. The good news is here is we have a lot of headroom. We're just starting the early part of that in the fourth quarter. That will predominantly play out in 2022 and then will also extend early into 2023 as we move forward. If we look at our transactional related activity, we've been making strong performance improvement in our annuitized based business with renewal rates and our on-prem transactional business has struggled, especially during the pandemic. This will bolster that as we move forward. And most importantly, we feel confident in the investments in innovation and what we're bringing to market with our modernized and containerized Cloud Pak offerings optimized on top of our Hybrid Cloud Red Hat platform that we're good. So with that, let me turn it over to Arvind."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.\nArvind Krishna: Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's my pleasure to be speaking with all of you again. We continue to make progress this quarter. Our revenue growth improved to 3% as reported, led by Global Business Services and our Software business and we grew adjusted free cash flow for the first half. Across every industry, enterprises are using technology to redesign business processes, whether it's automation in manufacturing, telemedicine in healthcare or omnichannel in retail. These digital transformations are enabled by a hybrid cloud environment. The technology and services we provide to our clients enable their business growth and productivity increases and improve customer experiences. This is why our strategy is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. At the same time, the overall spend environment continues to improve. With the economy reopening in many parts of the world, many markets and industries are getting back on track. We see this in North America and in select industries. Jim will delve deeper into our performance across the different parts of our business. But I want to be clear upfront that with our results over the last two quarters, we remain on track to achieve our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth at actual rates and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to take decisive steps and make the investments required to execute on our strategy. This includes making acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio, offering new innovations and digital capabilities to our clients, expanding our partner ecosystem, accelerating changes to our go-to-market model, while also instilling more of a growth mindset among our teams and building a more client-centric culture. We are executing the separation of Kyndryl, which is still on track to be completed by the end of the year.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the financial highlights and then comment on our revenue performance, business model dynamics, and cash and liquidity position, before getting into the segments. In the second quarter, we grew revenue over 3% as reported to $18.7 billion. We expanded our operating gross profit margin and grew gross profit dollars 4%. We reported operating earnings per share of $2.33. Our adjusted free cash flow was $3.8 billion through the first half, and we generated $11 billion over the last year. And our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong. We continued to make progress in our revenue performance, led by 7% growth in Global Business Services and 2% growth in software, both at constant currency. As Arvind mentioned, the spending environment is improving. We see this in markets where reopening is progressing, like the US and Canada, and in several countries in Western Europe. From an industry standpoint, we saw a meaningful improvement in some of the areas that had been more impacted by the pandemic like travel and transportation, automotive and industrial products. Globally, we are helping enterprises digitally transform, leveraging our platform approach. IBM's cloud revenue over the last year across software, services and infrastructure is now $27 billion, which is up at a double-digit rate. This continues to be led by Global Business Services and Cloud and Cognitive Software, whose cloud revenue this quarter was up 30% and 25% respectively. As our revenue performance improves, the fundamentals of our business model remain solid. We expanded operating margins, with gross margin up 30 basis points and pre-tax margin up 70 basis points. We have taken actions to streamline and simplify our operating model. As I've said in the past, roughly one-third of the structural actions are to improve Global Technology Services' profit profile ahead of the separation of Kyndryl. We are realizing these savings, and our GTS gross and pre-tax margins are up this quarter. The other roughly two-thirds of the targeted actions address stranded costs from the separation and create financial flexibility which we are investing for future growth. We are ramping investments in skills, innovation and in our ecosystem.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, we have included supplemental information at the end of the presentation. And finally, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference.  Our first question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Question I guess for Jim, Cloud and Cognitive Software as well as GBS PTI margins are down year-on-year. I imagine a lot of that is coming from the investments that you walk through. But can you talk about any other factors like mix that are playing into the margin performance in those groups? And also are you seeing any impact from labor shortages and wage increases, particularly in the services business? Thanks.\nJim Kavanaugh: Sure, Katy. Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, those two very important segments that you chose GBS and Software are two of our growth vectors within our business model. As we've said, entering the year, we guided both on revenue and on cash flow and we said that we were going to continue to invest significantly within those growth vectors as we move forward. And I see -- and I think what you see playing out here in the second quarter, is that investments starting to ramp up from the first quarter into the second quarter going forward. We are investing in front of demand because of what we said in the pre-remarks is that we see an encouraging macro and demand profile playing out and you see that with the strong acceleration in our software base of business quarter-to-quarter and in our GBS base of business. GBS, by the way, exceeded our expectations and actually got back to pre-pandemic revenue levels overall. But just to really bring it home: one, we're investing; two, we have high margins in our software base of business already, and the dynamics between Red Hat and the deferred revenue dissipating as we move through the year is really what you see play out in the second quarter overall. We feel very comfortable at the margin level in software. We're going to continue to invest in innovation ecosystem and skills and we feel very good about our GBS business overall. Labor pressures, yes, there is a war for talent going on. We are investing significantly, we're bringing thousands and thousands of GBS practitioners in through the first half and we feel pretty good about what the profile of that business is going forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Katy. Sheila, can we take the next question please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you. It's nice to see the growth in gross profit dollars two quarters in a row. You had very strong consulting growth and GBS growth as Jim just alluded, but gross margins comprised 60 basis points year-on-year in GBS. It would be a nice to see the full leverage in the model come through with both revenue growth and margin expansion to amplify the gross profit dollar growth. So my question is really, how much longer would you need to be in investment mode in GBS? And is it possible that we see in the coming quarters or years? When do we actually see both revenue growth and margin expansion come into the model in GBS? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Wamsi, thanks for the question. So just building on Katy's question upfront. We are and will continue to invest in this business as GBS is an essential part of our hybrid cloud platform-centric strategy. It is both the tip of the spear, if you want to call it, in driving the demand from an architectural point of view to our platform that then creates that flywheel effect that we talked about for every dollar that we land on the platform, we get $3 to $5 a software and $6 to $8 of services revenue. So we're going to invest significantly. Now with that said, we rebounded off of second quarter. Second quarter last year when the pandemic hit, we dropped 7 points quarter-to-quarter. We posted down 6 last year in GBS. We returned back to pre-pandemic revenue levels and exceeded growth expectations. But we're going to continue to invest in this part because of the importance GBS place at hybrid cloud platform and we'll get that profit dollar contribution and more importantly, you see it play out in our second key metric that we give guidance on and that's our adjusted free cash flow. And we feel very good about where our adjusted free cash flow is through the first half. It's up year-to-year really taken into account most of the cash tax headwind we talked about 90 days ago is pretty much behind us going forward. So our attainment wise on adjusted free cash flow, which is really going to be a reflection of both top line revenue acceleration and operating leverage and margin as we move forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Wamsi. Can we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if I could ask you a little bit about acquisitions. I think over the last year, you spent $3.2 billion on acquisitions. And Arvind, you've said that you expect acquisitions on a sustained basis to contribute about 100 basis points to 150 basis points of inorganic growth per year. So, is that what we should be thinking about, about $3 billion in acquisition spend, generating $600 million to $900 million, that's 100 basis points to 150 basis points of RemainCo? Is that sort of the mental model framework we should think about? And then could you comment specifically on how much acquisitions impacted GBS' reported growth rate and Cognitive apps reported growth rate in the quarter? Or just give us a dollar figure for the inorganic acquisition contribution to each of those businesses please? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Toni. Great question. So let's just start with the first part. So we are generating -- last year, if I remember correctly, $10.8 billion of free cash flow for the year 2020. We have said $11 billion to $12 billion this year. So if you do the math between dividends, acquisitions, and capital expenditures, you get to the $3 billion to $3.5 billion. If you now say that we are going to increase our free cash flow by $0.5 billion to $1 billion in a given year and you can expect that number on inorganic activities to go up year-over-year. So the $3 billion to $3.5 billion is a fair number for this year. It would -- it could go up as we begin to increase our cash flow. We have already said, next year we expect to generate $12 billion to $13 billion, not $11 billion to $12 billion. So that gives you one sense Toni, just on the absolute number. The second question you had in there on the GBS. So as we have said and offset before 100 basis points to 150 basis points of growth from acquisitions, I would say that GBS is right in the top end of that number. If you look at the second quarter and if you look at Cognitive applications actually more product Cognitive Software, all in, because I think Cognitive applications there was a net, if any, from acquisitions, the number would be at the very, very low number, I mean, maybe a few tens of basis points, nothing significant yet. Now, the GBS acquisitions give you an immediate return and then grow at a nice number, but obviously contributing a lot less there. Think of it in the software side, the model is they come in, they do because the deferred revenue begin to give you some acquisition, but over - revenue over 12 months. But those acquisitions grow very fast. So the contribution actually goes on for multiple years not just for a single year from those acquisitions to the overall growth rate. And so that's the slight difference. GBS immediately, about 150. Software, much smaller few tens. But imagine that all of those build up over time, that it provides a pretty nice tailwind then over two years to three years.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks for the question, Toni. Let's go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. Good afternoon, everyone. Arvind, I have a question on the hybrid cloud potential. You've talked a fair bit about it today and in the past and I think most investments really agree that hybrid cloud is the reality, but maybe you could touch on. a, why do you think IBM is better positioned to enable your customers to get there versus some of your peers? And then secondly, what does hybrid cloud mean for your profitability and free cash flow? Because I think to some extent there is a perception perhaps misperception that the shift from on-prem to hybrid is negative for IBM's margins.\nArvind Krishna: Hi Amit, thanks. So as you correctly have pointed out, I mean I wouldn't repeat you, but I obviously believe it, hybrid cloud is the reality for our clients. Now to get into the more meaty parts of your question. If you look at -- why would people prefer us for hybrid cloud? If I look at a given large hyperscaler, they'll do hybrid as in their own public cloud and maybe some on-premise means. The goal is to drive workload onto the public cloud. Who has the credibility to go across multiple public clouds, and that's why you hear me always say both Microsoft and Amazon are our partners, not only our competitors and that is an important play that IBM has done for many, many decades where we integrate across environments that our clients operate in. So that's one part. On a bit more of a technical level that was the primary reason for the Red Hat acquisition. Red Hat give us both the platform and the assets to be able to bring a hybrid cloud platform to bear, because we would all agree, I think all of your listeners and all of your audience would agree that Linux was the de facto operating system. Red Hat Linux is the de facto for on-premise and private environment, containers is the standard which people are going to move on to. So, if you see we begin really strong on-premise and private you can take that same exact environment to multiple public that gives us, we believe an advantage. Now let me acknowledge to the point you're making if hybrid cloud is the reality then everyone is going to start having a play in hybrid, but we believe that our play is advantage for the industries that we serve. That doesn't mean they will use us exclusively, but they will use us to a large extent and that is where we are headed there. The second part, now for your question, which I think actually plays right in on profitability and cash flow. The way we look at it, over two-thirds of where we get our revenue is going to lie in software. If that is the case and software comes at software margins, I'm not going to debate whether you get a difference in model from on-premise licensing to as a service-licensing, to term license model, all of those even out and pretty much on a wash over two year to three years. They are a difference in any given six months, but if I take a two year to three year view and that is what we really fixed on driving then all of that evens out and you begin to get gross margins back up in the 70s and 80s, and you begin to get the profitability and cash flow associated with that. And so that is the answer to that question. By the way the service is based on helping our clients go there. You can begin to see that, and I know that there were a couple of questions earlier on the GBS margin. Look we are very fixed on driving investments. So we drive investment, a little bit ahead, I'm not going to tell you years ahead, but maybe one or two quarters ahead of the revenue, while the revenue growth comes, we'll keep doing that and that will impact maybe percentages, but by 10s of basis points, but it shows up in absolute profit and absolute cash flow even in that part of the business.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, I would just add one thing to that Arvind to build on your point. When you look at the IBM company post separation of Kyndryl. The IBM company is going to be roughly around 45% to 50% software as far as composition of mix. That carries with it a high EBITDA profile already today. And just as one example, when you look at our Red Hat base of business today as CFO, I love that. That subscription model that has growth in ARR built into it overall. It's already running well north of the Rule of 40 today. So as we shift more and more to software based contribution that mix effect will help us bottom line in cash also.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Amit. Sheila, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Next, we will hear from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. You may proceed.\nMatt Cabral: Yes, thank you. Within Cloud and Cognitive, I was hoping to dig a little bit more into Cloud Paks, and wondering if you could talk about just more broadly the maturity of the Cloud Paks portfolio and where you are in the integration with OpenShift. Can you just talk about where you're seeing the impact in terms of customer adoption so far? And going forward, the contribution from Cloud Paks on the financial performance of the software segment from here?\nArvind Krishna: Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. Let me answer the first part of your question on the, I'll call it the architectural elements and the use cases. And then I'll give it to Jim to answer it on the financials listing. So, if you look at the maturity of Cloud Paks, I would tell you that every Cloud Paks we have been selling this year and deploying this year is on OpenShift. We made the move from other Kubernetes platforms onto OpenShift way starting in October of '19. And so yes, of course, let's acknowledge that people might have purchased prior to 2019 would have bought other Kubernetes platforms. And so by last year, 2020, it was all going onto OpenShift. I think that maturity is complete. Now if some people have prior version of the software deployed we observe typically within three years from day one, they do move to the new versions. So I would expect by the end of this year, even the prior deployed would have fully moved and that's done. If you look at customer adoption, Cloud Paks are a very strong contributor to the 3200 clients that we mentioned. Well over half of them come through Cloud Paks. And so what are the use cases. Look, the work we're doing with Palantir is a great example. Palantir runs on top of the Cloud Paks for data. That's a great example of what we're doing. When you hear us talk about Watson Assistant has in the CVS use case, which handled over 10 million calls in a quarter for COVID-19 vaccines that Watson Assistant runs on top of another Cloud Pak. So these are great examples of how mature the technology is. I would tell you the OpenShift maturity is complete and it really helps reinforce both adoption of OpenShift as well as then clients get very comfortable with deploying OpenShift for other use cases. It's a workload at the end of the day for OpenShift and as clients get comfortable, we might deploy it for other purposes as well. In terms of the financials, I'll pass it to Jim.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, just quickly Matt, thank you very much for the question. Taking a step back, first of all, we're very pleased with our overall progression within our software portfolio. More work to do, but we're making progress. And C&DP, which I'll remind everyone on the call and our investors is about 50% of our overall software portfolio and that's where the lion's share of our Cloud Paks sit. Now when you look at our C&DP performance, when we look at it on the way we manage the business on a historical normalized basis, we see acceleration. We return back to growth in first quarter, we accelerated that growth to 4% here in the second quarter. And that is really attributed to the nice momentum we're seeing in Cloud Paks. We announced Cloud Paks 18 months ago, two years ago, given our ELA historical client base that takes time to churn through that client base. And as you know, last year was the trough of our ELA renewal cycle. We start to improve on that later in the second half and really that ELA cycle plays out in 2022, but we actually had a very nice inflection here in the second quarter. Our Cloud Paks on NRR, net revenue renewal were north of 100%. So, we've said all along Arvind and myself that there is going to be shift to Cloud Paks and there's going to be lift with Cloud Paks. And now we're starting to see a higher mix contribution of Cloud Paks and we're starting to see where we do have shift we're getting north of 100% on NRR perspective and that's an encouraging trend.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Matt. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks. Good talk to you all. Just on the -- on the services side, consulting obviously great double-digit, you had signings were pretty strong here. Do you feel like from a backlog and pipeline perspective that you are starting to reach a little bit infection to get some better growth overall out of the services unit given what you see plus some of the investments that you're making? And then separately, forgive the follow-on question Patricia, but just on the TPP front, transaction processing platforms is it just a comps issue that we should look for that. The performance there to get better or are there other areas that we could be potentially monitoring to see some better performance there. Was it just waiting for that transition? Thanks.\nJim Kavanaugh: I'll take that, Arvind. Tien-Tsin, thank you very much for the question. When you look at our services base of business, we delivered $9.2 billion of signings in the quarter, it's up double digit at actual rate. We did see improvement in our backlog overall. It's really very different dynamics playing out here as we tried to say in the prepared remarks. We see very strong momentum in our GBS space of business. When you look at our signings in the quarter, we had strong performance, our trailing 12 months book-to-bill is 1.2. Through the first half, we have roughly double-digit growth in signings across all three sub-segments. Very good growth this quarter in large deals and we have continued momentum in small deals and we saw improvement in our revenue, in our backlog, and our revenue realization moving forward and that gives us comfort. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect about a normal quarter to quarter seasonality overall. We actually see GBS accelerating growth probably out another point from the -- from the second quarter overall. In GTS, really what we're seeing is a good performance overall. Leveraging our incumbency position and driving strong renewals. We're seeing with that incumbency position finally a turnaround with an encouraging trend on client base business volumes and project-based services that they are engaging in project-based services and our incumbency accounts were up 20% here in the second quarter, but as expected the new logos. While we have a very healthy pipeline in new logos out there, the sales cycles are elongated as we said in the prepared remarks. So we see some nice acceleration continuing in GBS overall, but again with GTS, it's a focus on the fundamentals of the business profile that means margin profit and cash and I think you've seen in the second quarter, we made some very good progress overall with margins up 110 basis points, pretax margins up 190 basis points and profit dollar growth, both in gross profit dollars and a pretax profit dollars. Lastly on TPP. Yes, as we talked about many times over the last year or so. We do see the transition happening in this portfolio with regards to a shift back more and more to consumption base, annuity base, purchasing versus in 2018 and 2019 we had a much healthier macroeconomic environment, a very catch --cash-rich environment, clients then shifted to more perpetual licenses. We're seeing that come back and that's going to play as it played out where we saw the revenue upside in '18 and '19. In '20 and '21, you're going to continue to see the headwind as we've been saying. We expect that to come back in 2022 back to normal market trend growth rates overall.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Let's go to the next question, Sheila.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. Actually most of my questions have been answered. I just have one follow-up question. I think Jim you mentioned, revenue retention of greater than 100% and I wasn't quite sure what the reference point was in software and whether you have any incremental data points you can share about revenue retention by business unit within the Cognitive segment?\nJim Kavanaugh: Sure, David. Thank you very much. Cloud Paks are definitely an essential part as we've invested significantly to containerize our software and optimize it on top of OpenShift our hybrid cloud platform overall. When we take a look at our Cloud Paks, we measure and manage, Arvind and I have a dashboard that we look at all of our large enterprise top clients overall, our deployment penetration within each of those clients and we're able to see as we transition a client from a traditional middleware to a cloud-based containerized solution, not only can we track the deployment and how that progresses over time we can see the dollar of yesterday versus the dollar of today as they transition to Cloud Paks and we measure the net revenue retention. Not only how much come in whether we are able to upsell, cross-sell with multiple Cloud Paks as we move forward. And like I said in the second quarter we're making progress, much more to do, but we're making progress on the mix composition of moving more and more to Cloud Paks and we're also making progress on capturing more of our clients' wallet share dollar for that same dollar of traditional middleware overall. Hopefully, that helps David.\nArvind Krishna: Jim, to make it into business terms or a use case, what that tells you is that when they renew, they are actually buying more volume, which means it's a beginning to become a larger part of the real estate, technology real estate at a client.\nPatricia Murphy: Very good. Thank you, David. You know, we're at the top of the hour, but let's take one more question, Sheila.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, many thanks team. I wanted to ask Arvind, you a question on revisiting on what your growth assumptions or targets are around Cognitive. And the particular reference point to my question this quarter you generated roughly 2% revenue growth and it was -- you had the benefit of compare particularly on some of the line items within Cognitive and so not particularly -- it's good growth, but still a ways to go to reach our longer-term target. So what happens to change that improves Cognitive and Part B the backdrop is if I think about Red Hat and we remain pretty positive on Red Hat even over the next couple of years, but you still face the uphill battle of the longer-term trends within Cognitive Db2 is probably declining market as you've talked about in the past transaction processing platforms is also a declining I think revenue stream over the arc of time. So if you could just revisit on how do you reach your longer term growth rates within Cognitive? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Right. Thanks, Keith, important question, and important element of our pieces going forward. So we've been clear that our Cloud and Cognitive software will grow mid-single-digit going forward. And you are questioning Keith, how is that going to be possible? So first and most important element Red Hat today is sitting at about in rough numbers 25% of the business, growing at about 17% this quarter, let's call it 15% in the medium term. But as opposed to being 25% is going to go up and up to become 35% of the total and over a longer term even more. So 15% for one-third of the business you kind of get the contribution from that, which is quite significant. Also, as we are both innovating organically example in Cloud Paks and we are acquiring businesses that are going to turbocharge, bit of a pun on Turbonomic, our business there on both management as well as on cyber-security, we expect to see very high growth rates there. High-single digit that is well above the mid-maybe into the low-double digits. Will we see declines in some parts of the portfolio? We have been very transparent. We expect DPP  to be between mid and high single-digit decline in the mid to long term, but it becomes a smaller and smaller portion of the total. So it has -- it has a drag from there. Cognitive applications; we expect to be right in there, but it's the smallest part of the portfolio, it's not the biggest part of the portfolio. And so just a recap on that number one, Red Hat growing in the mid-teens as it becomes bigger -- a bigger absolute contributor to the total. The rest of the cloud and data platform with a mixture of both organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions is going to then contribute to growth at or above the mid-single digits in the medium term. DPP  mid-single-digit decline , probably right in line with the model. So hopefully Keith that gives you a breakdown into a lot of pieces. By the way the DB2 that you mentioned declining is very much inside the DPP . So those are not really different questions. Dp2 mainframe and DPP  are one and the same. So, let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. We again made progress in this quarter, but we acknowledge we still have more to do. As you move into the second half, we are continuing to invest and execute on our actions, which includes the separation of Kyndryl. All of this positions IBM to exit the year in a strong position on a path to sustainable growth and I look forward to continuing the dialog with you.\nPatricia Murphy: Great. Sheila, can I turn it back to you to close out the call?\nOperator: Absolutely, thank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the financial highlights and then comment on our revenue performance, business model dynamics, and cash and liquidity position, before getting into the segments. In the second quarter, we grew revenue over 3% as reported to $18.7 billion. We expanded our operating gross profit margin and grew gross profit dollars 4%. We reported operating earnings per share of $2.33. Our adjusted free cash flow was $3.8 billion through the first half, and we generated $11 billion over the last year. And our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong. We continued to make progress in our revenue performance, led by 7% growth in Global Business Services and 2% growth in software, both at constant currency. As Arvind mentioned, the spending environment is improving. We see this in markets where reopening is progressing, like the US and Canada, and in several countries in Western Europe. From an industry standpoint, we saw a meaningful improvement in some of the areas that had been more impacted by the pandemic like travel and transportation, automotive and industrial products. Globally, we are helping enterprises digitally transform, leveraging our platform approach. IBM's cloud revenue over the last year across software, services and infrastructure is now $27 billion, which is up at a double-digit rate. This continues to be led by Global Business Services and Cloud and Cognitive Software, whose cloud revenue this quarter was up 30% and 25% respectively. As our revenue performance improves, the fundamentals of our business model remain solid. We expanded operating margins, with gross margin up 30 basis points and pre-tax margin up 70 basis points. We have taken actions to streamline and simplify our operating model. As I've said in the past, roughly one-third of the structural actions are to improve Global Technology Services' profit profile ahead of the separation of Kyndryl. We are realizing these savings, and our GTS gross and pre-tax margins are up this quarter. The other roughly two-thirds of the targeted actions address stranded costs from the separation and create financial flexibility which we are investing for future growth. We are ramping investments in skills, innovation and in our ecosystem. Sure, Katy. Thank you very much for the question. Obviously, those two very important segments that you chose GBS and Software are two of our growth vectors within our business model. As we've said, entering the year, we guided both on revenue and on cash flow and we said that we were going to continue to invest significantly within those growth vectors as we move forward. And I see -- and I think what you see playing out here in the second quarter, is that investments starting to ramp up from the first quarter into the second quarter going forward. We are investing in front of demand because of what we said in the pre-remarks is that we see an encouraging macro and demand profile playing out and you see that with the strong acceleration in our software base of business quarter-to-quarter and in our GBS base of business. GBS, by the way, exceeded our expectations and actually got back to pre-pandemic revenue levels overall. But just to really bring it home: one, we're investing; two, we have high margins in our software base of business already, and the dynamics between Red Hat and the deferred revenue dissipating as we move through the year is really what you see play out in the second quarter overall. We feel very comfortable at the margin level in software. We're going to continue to invest in innovation ecosystem and skills and we feel very good about our GBS business overall. Labor pressures, yes, there is a war for talent going on. We are investing significantly, we're bringing thousands and thousands of GBS practitioners in through the first half and we feel pretty good about what the profile of that business is going forward. Wamsi, thanks for the question. So just building on Katy's question upfront. We are and will continue to invest in this business as GBS is an essential part of our hybrid cloud platform-centric strategy. It is both the tip of the spear, if you want to call it, in driving the demand from an architectural point of view to our platform that then creates that flywheel effect that we talked about for every dollar that we land on the platform, we get $3 to $5 a software and $6 to $8 of services revenue. So we're going to invest significantly. Now with that said, we rebounded off of second quarter. Second quarter last year when the pandemic hit, we dropped 7 points quarter-to-quarter. We posted down 6 last year in GBS. We returned back to pre-pandemic revenue levels and exceeded growth expectations. But we're going to continue to invest in this part because of the importance GBS place at hybrid cloud platform and we'll get that profit dollar contribution and more importantly, you see it play out in our second key metric that we give guidance on and that's our adjusted free cash flow. And we feel very good about where our adjusted free cash flow is through the first half. It's up year-to-year really taken into account most of the cash tax headwind we talked about 90 days ago is pretty much behind us going forward. So our attainment wise on adjusted free cash flow, which is really going to be a reflection of both top line revenue acceleration and operating leverage and margin as we move forward. Yes, I would just add one thing to that Arvind to build on your point. When you look at the IBM company post separation of Kyndryl. The IBM company is going to be roughly around 45% to 50% software as far as composition of mix. That carries with it a high EBITDA profile already today. And just as one example, when you look at our Red Hat base of business today as CFO, I love that. That subscription model that has growth in ARR built into it overall. It's already running well north of the Rule of 40 today. So as we shift more and more to software based contribution that mix effect will help us bottom line in cash also. Yes, just quickly Matt, thank you very much for the question. Taking a step back, first of all, we're very pleased with our overall progression within our software portfolio. More work to do, but we're making progress. And C&DP, which I'll remind everyone on the call and our investors is about 50% of our overall software portfolio and that's where the lion's share of our Cloud Paks sit. Now when you look at our C&DP performance, when we look at it on the way we manage the business on a historical normalized basis, we see acceleration. We return back to growth in first quarter, we accelerated that growth to 4% here in the second quarter. And that is really attributed to the nice momentum we're seeing in Cloud Paks. We announced Cloud Paks 18 months ago, two years ago, given our ELA historical client base that takes time to churn through that client base. And as you know, last year was the trough of our ELA renewal cycle. We start to improve on that later in the second half and really that ELA cycle plays out in 2022, but we actually had a very nice inflection here in the second quarter. Our Cloud Paks on NRR, net revenue renewal were north of 100%. So, we've said all along Arvind and myself that there is going to be shift to Cloud Paks and there's going to be lift with Cloud Paks. And now we're starting to see a higher mix contribution of Cloud Paks and we're starting to see where we do have shift we're getting north of 100% on NRR perspective and that's an encouraging trend. I'll take that, Arvind. Tien-Tsin, thank you very much for the question. When you look at our services base of business, we delivered $9.2 billion of signings in the quarter, it's up double digit at actual rate. We did see improvement in our backlog overall. It's really very different dynamics playing out here as we tried to say in the prepared remarks. We see very strong momentum in our GBS space of business. When you look at our signings in the quarter, we had strong performance, our trailing 12 months book-to-bill is 1.2. Through the first half, we have roughly double-digit growth in signings across all three sub-segments. Very good growth this quarter in large deals and we have continued momentum in small deals and we saw improvement in our revenue, in our backlog, and our revenue realization moving forward and that gives us comfort. As we said in the prepared remarks, we expect about a normal quarter to quarter seasonality overall. We actually see GBS accelerating growth probably out another point from the -- from the second quarter overall. In GTS, really what we're seeing is a good performance overall. Leveraging our incumbency position and driving strong renewals. We're seeing with that incumbency position finally a turnaround with an encouraging trend on client base business volumes and project-based services that they are engaging in project-based services and our incumbency accounts were up 20% here in the second quarter, but as expected the new logos. While we have a very healthy pipeline in new logos out there, the sales cycles are elongated as we said in the prepared remarks.

In '20 and '21, you're going to continue to see the headwind as we've been saying. We expect that to come back in 2022 back to normal market trend growth rates overall. Sure, David.

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. It's my pleasure to be speaking with all of you again. We continue to make progress this quarter. Our revenue growth improved to 3% as reported, led by Global Business Services and our Software business and we grew adjusted free cash flow for the first half. Across every industry, enterprises are using technology to redesign business processes, whether it's automation in manufacturing, telemedicine in healthcare or omnichannel in retail. These digital transformations are enabled by a hybrid cloud environment. The technology and services we provide to our clients enable their business growth and productivity increases and improve customer experiences. This is why our strategy is focused on hybrid cloud and AI. At the same time, the overall spend environment continues to improve. With the economy reopening in many parts of the world, many markets and industries are getting back on track. We see this in North America and in select industries. Jim will delve deeper into our performance across the different parts of our business. But I want to be clear upfront that with our results over the last two quarters, we remain on track to achieve our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth at actual rates and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. We continue to take decisive steps and make the investments required to execute on our strategy. This includes making acquisitions that strengthen our portfolio, offering new innovations and digital capabilities to our clients, expanding our partner ecosystem, accelerating changes to our go-to-market model, while also instilling more of a growth mindset among our teams and building a more client-centric culture. We are executing the separation of Kyndryl, which is still on track to be completed by the end of the year. Thanks, Toni. Great question. So let's just start with the first part. So we are generating -- last year, if I remember correctly, $10.8 billion of free cash flow for the year 2020. We have said $11 billion to $12 billion this year. So if you do the math between dividends, acquisitions, and capital expenditures, you get to the $3 billion to $3.5 billion. If you now say that we are going to increase our free cash flow by $0.5 billion to $1 billion in a given year and you can expect that number on inorganic activities to go up year-over-year. So the $3 billion to $3.5 billion is a fair number for this year. It would -- it could go up as we begin to increase our cash flow. We have already said, next year we expect to generate $12 billion to $13 billion, not $11 billion to $12 billion. So that gives you one sense Toni, just on the absolute number. The second question you had in there on the GBS. So as we have said and offset before 100 basis points to 150 basis points of growth from acquisitions, I would say that GBS is right in the top end of that number. If you look at the second quarter and if you look at Cognitive applications actually more product Cognitive Software, all in, because I think Cognitive applications there was a net, if any, from acquisitions, the number would be at the very, very low number, I mean, maybe a few tens of basis points, nothing significant yet. Now, the GBS acquisitions give you an immediate return and then grow at a nice number, but obviously contributing a lot less there. Think of it in the software side, the model is they come in, they do because the deferred revenue begin to give you some acquisition, but over - revenue over 12 months. But those acquisitions grow very fast. So the contribution actually goes on for multiple years not just for a single year from those acquisitions to the overall growth rate. And so that's the slight difference. GBS immediately, about 150. Software, much smaller few tens. But imagine that all of those build up over time, that it provides a pretty nice tailwind then over two years to three years. Hi Amit, thanks. So as you correctly have pointed out, I mean I wouldn't repeat you, but I obviously believe it, hybrid cloud is the reality for our clients. Now to get into the more meaty parts of your question. If you look at -- why would people prefer us for hybrid cloud? If I look at a given large hyperscaler, they'll do hybrid as in their own public cloud and maybe some on-premise means. The goal is to drive workload onto the public cloud. Who has the credibility to go across multiple public clouds, and that's why you hear me always say both Microsoft and Amazon are our partners, not only our competitors and that is an important play that IBM has done for many, many decades where we integrate across environments that our clients operate in. So that's one part. On a bit more of a technical level that was the primary reason for the Red Hat acquisition. Red Hat give us both the platform and the assets to be able to bring a hybrid cloud platform to bear, because we would all agree, I think all of your listeners and all of your audience would agree that Linux was the de facto operating system. Red Hat Linux is the de facto for on-premise and private environment, containers is the standard which people are going to move on to. So, if you see we begin really strong on-premise and private you can take that same exact environment to multiple public that gives us, we believe an advantage. Now let me acknowledge to the point you're making if hybrid cloud is the reality then everyone is going to start having a play in hybrid, but we believe that our play is advantage for the industries that we serve. That doesn't mean they will use us exclusively, but they will use us to a large extent and that is where we are headed there. The second part, now for your question, which I think actually plays right in on profitability and cash flow. The way we look at it, over two-thirds of where we get our revenue is going to lie in software. If that is the case and software comes at software margins, I'm not going to debate whether you get a difference in model from on-premise licensing to as a service-licensing, to term license model, all of those even out and pretty much on a wash over two year to three years. They are a difference in any given six months, but if I take a two year to three year view and that is what we really fixed on driving then all of that evens out and you begin to get gross margins back up in the 70s and 80s, and you begin to get the profitability and cash flow associated with that. And so that is the answer to that question. By the way the service is based on helping our clients go there. You can begin to see that, and I know that there were a couple of questions earlier on the GBS margin. Look we are very fixed on driving investments. So we drive investment, a little bit ahead, I'm not going to tell you years ahead, but maybe one or two quarters ahead of the revenue, while the revenue growth comes, we'll keep doing that and that will impact maybe percentages, but by 10s of basis points, but it shows up in absolute profit and absolute cash flow even in that part of the business. Yes. Matt, thanks for the question. Let me answer the first part of your question on the, I'll call it the architectural elements and the use cases. And then I'll give it to Jim to answer it on the financials listing. So, if you look at the maturity of Cloud Paks, I would tell you that every Cloud Paks we have been selling this year and deploying this year is on OpenShift. We made the move from other Kubernetes platforms onto OpenShift way starting in October of '19. And so yes, of course, let's acknowledge that people might have purchased prior to 2019 would have bought other Kubernetes platforms. And so by last year, 2020, it was all going onto OpenShift. I think that maturity is complete. Now if some people have prior version of the software deployed we observe typically within three years from day one, they do move to the new versions. So I would expect by the end of this year, even the prior deployed would have fully moved and that's done. If you look at customer adoption, Cloud Paks are a very strong contributor to the 3200 clients that we mentioned. Well over half of them come through Cloud Paks. And so what are the use cases. Look, the work we're doing with Palantir is a great example. Palantir runs on top of the Cloud Paks for data. That's a great example of what we're doing. When you hear us talk about Watson Assistant has in the CVS use case, which handled over 10 million calls in a quarter for COVID-19 vaccines that Watson Assistant runs on top of another Cloud Pak. So these are great examples of how mature the technology is. I would tell you the OpenShift maturity is complete and it really helps reinforce both adoption of OpenShift as well as then clients get very comfortable with deploying OpenShift for other use cases. It's a workload at the end of the day for OpenShift and as clients get comfortable, we might deploy it for other purposes as well. In terms of the financials, I'll pass it to Jim. Jim, to make it into business terms or a use case, what that tells you is that when they renew, they are actually buying more volume, which means it's a beginning to become a larger part of the real estate, technology real estate at a client. Right. Thanks, Keith, important question, and important element of our pieces going forward. So we've been clear that our Cloud and Cognitive software will grow mid-single-digit going forward. And you are questioning Keith, how is that going to be possible? So first and most important element Red Hat today is sitting at about in rough numbers 25% of the business, growing at about 17% this quarter, let's call it 15% in the medium term. But as opposed to being 25% is going to go up and up to become 35% of the total and over a longer term even more. So 15% for one-third of the business you kind of get the contribution from that, which is quite significant. Also, as we are both innovating organically example in Cloud Paks and we are acquiring businesses that are going to turbocharge, bit of a pun on Turbonomic, our business there on both management as well as on cyber-security, we expect to see very high growth rates there. High-single digit that is well above the mid-maybe into the low-double digits. Will we see declines in some parts of the portfolio? We have been very transparent. We expect DPP  to be between mid and high single-digit decline in the mid to long term, but it becomes a smaller and smaller portion of the total. So it has -- it has a drag from there. Cognitive applications; we expect to be right in there, but it's the smallest part of the portfolio, it's not the biggest part of the portfolio. And so just a recap on that number one, Red Hat growing in the mid-teens as it becomes bigger -- a bigger absolute contributor to the total. The rest of the cloud and data platform with a mixture of both organic innovation and inorganic acquisitions is going to then contribute to growth at or above the mid-single digits in the medium term. DPP  mid-single-digit decline , probably right in line with the model. So hopefully Keith that gives you a breakdown into a lot of pieces. By the way the DB2 that you mentioned declining is very much inside the DPP . So those are not really different questions. Dp2 mainframe and DPP  are one and the same. So, let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. We again made progress in this quarter, but we acknowledge we still have more to do. As you move into the second half, we are continuing to invest and execute on our actions, which includes the separation of Kyndryl. All of this positions IBM to exit the year in a strong position on a path to sustainable growth and I look forward to continuing the dialog with you."

This is Patricia Murphy and I\u2019d like to welcome you to IBM\u2019s First Quarter 2021 Earnings Presentation. I am here with Arvind Krishna, IBM\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM\u2019s Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We will post today\u2019s prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow.\nArvind Krishna: Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be speaking with all of you again. In our last call, we shared our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. While it\u2019s still early in the year and a lot remains to be done, we are confident enough to say that we are on track. Last quarter, I also talked about how the events of the last year have increased the needs for our clients to accelerate their digital transformations. This is continuing and the overall spend environment is improving, while there are some clear differences by geography and industry. With that as a backdrop, in the first quarter, we posted revenue growth at actual rates and grew free cash flow. We can see signs of progress in a number of areas. Our results in Cloud & Cognitive Software and Global Business Services revenue show that they are on an improved trajectory, including a return to growth in consulting. IBM Z again demonstrated its value as an enduring platform. Meanwhile, we improved margins in our Global Technology Services led by managed infrastructure services. As Jim will explain to you, all of this helped to deliver free cash flow improvement, which is a key focus area. As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on the important changes we are making to the company, from the acquisitions we are making, to the investments to expand our partner ecosystem, to the significant overhaul of our go-to-market model that we announced back in January, to the changes we are bringing to our culture to instill more of a growth mindset.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. I will get right into the numbers. In the first quarter, our revenue of $17.7 billion grew 1% as reported. We expanded our gross profit margin and grew gross profit dollars. We reported operating earnings per share of $1.77. Our adjusted free cash flow was up, resulting in $11.6 billion over the last year and our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong. As Arvind said, we made progress, but more to do. You can see this progress in our revenue with an improvement in the trajectory of our constant currency results. Our revenue was up in Cloud & Cognitive Software and in Systems, and consulting returned to growth. We are capitalizing on clients\u2019 digital transformations and journeys to cloud. We take a platform approach to hybrid cloud and AI, with capabilities in infrastructure, software and cloud services. Across these, our cloud revenue was up 18% in the quarter and over the last twelve months, and now stands at over $26 billion for the last year. The fundamentals in our business model also continued to improve. We expanded operating gross profit margin this quarter by 110 basis points. I will remind you how we manage our business. We manage our services businesses at the gross margin level, while we look to capture the value of our product-based businesses at the pre-tax margin level. We had good margin expansion across our segments on those bases. This operating leverage enables a higher level of investment. We are investing in innovation, in skills and in our ecosystem as we execute on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our hiring was up year-to-year, with thousands of people hired in the quarter. We closed six acquisitions since mid-December. We are building out pre-sales garages, adding go-to-market and delivery capabilities in GBS, and technical skills in Red Hat. And we are increasing R&D in areas like AI and quantum to drive innovation. Our year-to-year expense dynamics reflect this investment, though it was offset by lower workforce rebalancing charges year-to-year and lower travel expense in the current environment. Let me round out the financial highlights with some color on our strong free cash flow and balance sheet and liquidity position. We had a good start to the year with $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow, and $11.6 billion over the last year. This adjusted view excludes the cash impact of over $600 million for the structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter and transaction charges associated with the separation of our managed infrastructure services business.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. Before we begin the Q&A with Arvind and Jim, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, we have included supplemental information at the end of the presentation. And finally, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. So, Operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nMatt Cabral: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good to see Cloud & Cognitive return to growth in the quarter. Just wondering if you could update us on, what you are seeing in terms of the underlying demand environment in software and just where you are in dealing with some of the issues that weighed on the more transactional side of the business in Q4? And then software going forward, just wondering how we should think about the cadence of revenue for the balance of the year from here?\nArvind Krishna: Matt, thanks for the question. Look, I think, that the spend environment overall is improving, Matt. I think I can say that, definitely compared to the fourth quarter and we talked in the fourth quarter about various pauses in buying. We didn\u2019t really see that in the first quarter. Now that said, I do have to acknowledge there are some differences by geography and industry. When you look in the underlying results, you can see the Americas was stronger. There are pockets in Asia that depends very much by country and we can all guess which ones are doing better, which ones are doing worse. It does depend on both COVID rates and the pauses that happened then due to business circumstances. We do sense a bit of caution in Europe and you can see that in the numbers. So you can sort of expect that. You can also see that there are going to be differences by industry. Those most impacted are the obvious ones, travel, tourism and all others that then get touched by those. So that\u2019s a color of what\u2019s happening. However, as I have iterated before, we do see our clients accelerate their digital transformation and as they accelerate their digital transformation, our hybrid cloud thesis comes to play very strongly. Our multi-Cloud, which is multiple public Clouds, as well as private come into play. All the reasons that I mentioned around sovereignty and choice come into play and you can see that then in our Red Hat results.  So then explicitly addressing your Cloud & Cognitive Software, we expect Red Hat to maintain itself in the mid to high-teens. That will show through in the Cloud and Data platform results being strong. We expect our applications, our AI applications, to remain in the single-digit software growth, and we can see that, we talked about the strong demand for security in there. I do expect to see continued declines in our TPP software, but it doesn\u2019t really worry us. I mean, those are things where if I look at a two-year or three-year CAGR, we expect to see mid-to-high single-digit declines. But in any given period, it can be a little bit lumpy and we see that there. And so we expect this to carry on through this year. Second quarter, I would be somewhat optimistic, but we have got to go deliver it, Matt.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Matt. Can we go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nKaty Huberty: Thank you. Good afternoon. Arvind, you talked about increased investments in sales resources, technical skills, R&D. We saw M&A pick up this quarter. And all of this is meant to drive that mid single-digit sustainable revenue growth that you have talked about, which I believe you have said that you can achieve next year. Can you just help us at a high level bridge how you get to the 4% to 5% revenue growth? What are the primary sources of growth acceleration at the segment level? How much M&A contribution should we be contemplating? And also in next year\u2019s growth rate, are you baking in the revenue benefit that you will see as some of the internal revenue becomes reported as external post the spin? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Katy. It\u2019s pretty clear you are a good student of what we say and publish. So let me try to unpack your question. Let me first talk about how do all these investments result in mid single-digit revenue growth. So if you look at it, we keep saying Red Hat at mid- to high-teens, leading to overall software in the mid-single digits. That will include the TPP mod decline but the overall will be mid single-digit. That could include I will call it any business as usual acquisitions. But the current market value, I don\u2019t see acquisitions adding a significant amount to IBM\u2019s topline. You can do the math with what we can put in. It will be well less than a point overall. We can just -- I think we can say that. Then if I look at our go to market investments, whether that\u2019s technical resources, garages, client success managers, our segmentation, that is not yet really paying off. We see some early signals in the 200 clients doing this. I do expect that can contribute a couple of points maybe a bit more for next year. But you will see that inside our software and our GBS numbers. It\u2019s not additive to those. We have also investing about $1 billion in our ecosystem. That will contribute to improving GBS growth rate to beyond the pre-pandemic rate. So that then takes me to GBS. We will this year come back to the pre-pandemic growth rates of $2 billion to $4 billion, but the mixture of the acquisitions and the go-to-market changes should take them higher than that by the end of the year into next year. Now, you asked also about will internal revenue contribute to this. Katy, the internal revenue is a one-time change. So we have talked about sustainable mid single-digit revenue growth not just for one year. So while it might help next year, we are not counting on that to be a contributor because it\u2019s only once. It\u2019s not every year. So, hopefully, Red Hat contributing together with the acquisitions of software in the mid-single digits, GBS with all the changes we are describing perhaps better than mid-single digits. Our systems if I take a two-year to three-year view kind of flattish, but in any given year it might increase or decrease but not by a whole lot. It doesn\u2019t impact the topline a lot and that\u2019s how sort of we get to the mid-single-digit sustainably. So you might get a one-year benefit from the -- from internal going to external, but not permanent. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t really count on that. Hopefully that gives you an answer to your different parts of the question.\nJim Kavanaugh: And as we complete the Form 10 process, which we are well on our way right now, Katy, I would tell you one as you know quite well, we will be transparent about the strategic commercial relationship we have between IBM and Kyndryl going forward and we will disclose what those relationships are and how we will treat that revenue. But more work to be done and we will come back to you at the appropriate time.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Katy. Sheila, can we please go to next question.\nOperator: Absolutely. Next we will hear from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you for taking my question. I guess this is a clarification or maybe two clarifications. I am wondering if you can just comment. I think you said that you think consensus revenue estimates for Q2 are reasonable. They are up about $500 million sequentially from Q1. If I look back at normal seasonality, typically revenues up about $1 billion and it sounds like IT spend is improving. So if anything one would expect better than normal seasonality. So I am wondering whether you are being conservative or there were some one-time things that happened in Q1, but why wouldn\u2019t you underwrite normal or better than normal seasonality, which I have as about a $1 billion sequential increase in revenues? And then separately, Arvind, could you just clarify, when you talk about IBM as an AI company, what role does Watson play in that? I don\u2019t think that name was really mentioned on the call. There\u2019s speculation about Watson Health. Maybe you can give us an update on how Watson fits into IBM as an AI company and specifically what\u2019s happening with Watson Health and Watson Financial? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Toni, thank you for your question. And I will handle the first part and provide some clarity around our forward-looking guidance and then turn it over to Arvind for your second part of the question. But as we said in prepared remarks, similar to 90 days ago, in fact we are even more confident in the position we put in place with regards to our two most important measures, one, revenue growth, and second, adjusted free cash flow, which is going to provide the fuel for the investments needed for us to capture that hybrid cloud $1 trillion TAM. Now, we reiterated that we are going to grow revenue overall for the year and that is despite currency volatility again with the U.S. dollar appreciating 90 days ago. We lost about a point of revenue for the year and we lost about a point of revenue in the second quarter. So now going to your math with regards to our historical quarter-to-quarter. Very close, I mean, the math I got in my head is somewhere around $900 million, $950 million give or take quarter-to-quarter. We see normal historical attainment across 1Q to 2Q in both our software base of business, as Arvind said. We are feeling even more confident given the rebound here in the first quarter and also in both of our services-based businesses, we see normal historical attainment to that roughly $900 million to $950 million. Now, given our first quarter performance of driving a very strong mainframe cycle growing 49% in the first quarter, in the seventh quarter of the program, which is unheard of coming off of 60% growth last year, Arvind and I both believe it\u2019s very prudent for us as we go forward with our guidance to not count on continued acceleration of our mainframe. We are very pleased with the performance. We are pleased with the value proposition. But I would say against that $900 million to $950 million, I would take a couple hundred million off of that number just based on first quarter\u2019s very strong performance in mainframe and that not concluding going forward. So let me turn it over to Arvind for the second part.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks. So, Toni, Watson remains critically important to us. To be absolutely clear, Watson is the brand product name for our AI capabilities. You will see it in the market as Watson Conversational Agent, but you will also see it as, for example, our security products with Watson. It is embedded inside our Cloud Pak for data and called out as Watson. Let me give you a quick example of where we are seeing a huge amount of success. So let me take one of the large entities doing vaccine administration in the United States. When they were -- when they realized in December they could do this, they slowly began to realize that they could get tens of millions of calls every quarter and then how would they handle them? Staff of tens of thousands of people or perhaps deploy Watson. And so far at one of these places and we are deploying a lot more than one, 5 million calls handled in the quarter with over 70% handled by Watson. You now think about extrapolating this over the year. So that would make it 20 million in four quarters and with the confidence building up on one program you could imagine it going to others. This is a lot more straightforward to do and where I think AI excels in handling issues in both improving client satisfaction, because you get an instantaneous answer, but also in taking cost out and those are rare in our industry where you get both together. We see lots and lots of opportunities here. We also see a lot of Watson being embedded on how to automate data cleansing, on how to do AI operations, on dramatically improving the resilience of people\u2019s IT infrastructure. So, Toni, to net it out, Watson remains really important. AI is in the early parts of its journey. Not us, consultants have estimated $16 trillion of global productivity over the decade. We are maybe 5% of our way into that journey. Watson will be the tool that unlocks that for our clients albeit in areas like IT, in data, in conversation, in call handling and in all these areas where we excel and we have a large footprint with our clients.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Toni. Can we please take the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Arvind, you said the go to market changes have not yet had an impact. Should we expect to see some benefit in the second half of 2021 and if you could maybe address what the cadence of the benefit would be across the business segments, where it would play out first and later, that would be helpful? And separately, maybe you can just help us think through what\u2019s going on with bookings and backlog. The signings numbers were quite weak relative to the confidence you are expressing on consulting growth, is there a pause given the upcoming spin or maybe any -- maybe if you could just dig down into that a little bit, that would be great? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Wamsi. Look, go-to-market changes, Wamsi, always have I will call it a bit of a hystericist loop. It takes time to take impact. We rolled them out in the beginning of January, but then you have to -- there\u2019s a human part to this. You have to assign people to accounts. There is some level of learning, there\u2019s some level of changes and all of that just takes months to flow through. I wish I could do it quicker, but I have got to acknowledge it takes months. That\u2019s why you hear me say it will take time for us to see the benefit.  Where will we see the benefit? We would expect to see improved productivity for our sales teams that cover our large accounts. That will result in better software growth and in better GBS growth. I do expect to see that in the second half. I expect to see even more of it going into 2022. As we are also investing in what we are calling our ecosystem, to be clear, that is investments whether it\u2019s in Schlumberger or Siemens or Palantir, just to name some from this last quarter. But before that, relationships we had with Box and Slack and Adobe and Salesforce and SAP. You expect to see all of those play out in the improved growth both in software and in GBS. So you kind of sort of unpack those and you see that. Now, when I talk about why would I see more productivity in our top accounts? Well, the 200 garage engagements that I mentioned, you expect that all of those will build pipeline, oftentimes we might never have had in the past. So that is why you begin to see improved yield in the top accounts. So I expect to see some definite, we will see it in our numbers in the second half and then more going into next year. For the second part of the question, I will hand it to Jim to talk a little bit about signings.\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Let me unpack some of this for you. First of all, printed numbers, signings down 27% to your point. Entirely driven by our large deal renewal comparison the last first quarter in GTS. If you remember, we signed two massive deals last year with Anthem and Caixa, well in excess of $1 billion a piece in each. But I think this goes to the testament that I have talked about many times on this call and that is all signings are not created equal. The duration, the mix, the offering, the content, all impact how signings translate into backlog and how backlog then translates into revenue realization overall. So let\u2019s talk a little bit about the GTS portfolio, because that\u2019s where it really centers around here in the quarter. When you look at GTS, I think, there\u2019s a couple different dynamics playing out. First, yes, greater than $100 million deals. We were down substantially compared to last year just off of that very tough compare and I will remind you we grew GTS signings north of 40% last year. So, second, though, is our mid-sized deals, read that kind of $10 million to $100 million. We were up high teens and embedded in that, we also had another nice quarter of new logos, which means we are out there winning new business, capturing new client value even in light of the announced separation with Kyndryl. The second component at the heart of your question I think is are we losing business or is business getting paused. I would think one with the new logo wins and, second, we have consistent high renewal rates in this business. This business is very sticky from a managed infrastructure services perspective and we have high 90%-plus renewal rates and we have not seen that change since the announcement. Now, with that said, are there pipeline that has built up that naturally some clients are pausing so they wait to see what our Form 10 is? Yeah. And I don\u2019t think we expected anything different overall. But when you take all that together, our backlog position overall in GTS and our backlog run out, we actually see continued sequential improvement, nice improvement off of fourth quarter, 3 points better and we see that continue modestly here from 1Q to 2Q. And that\u2019s a reflection of those new logos that are going to start ramping up and that\u2019s a reflection of our mid-sized deals which by the way has changed the duration in that part of the portfolio by one month overall which is impacting the revenue realization. So we still feel very good and very comfortable. We have got a very good pipeline in front of us and we see better revenue realization.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Wamsi. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Next you will hear from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may proceed.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I was hoping if you could touch a little bit more on the GBS performance. We saw a nice improvement I think from what we saw in the December quarter, it was down, but a nice 400 basis points improvement nonetheless. And consulting I think it was notable that we started to see growth over there. So I was hoping you could just help us understand, if you should think about consulting growth as a leading indicator to what GBS can do and would we expect this to be positive growth for GBS in calendar 2021? And then also have you clarify this for me, as you go through the process of splitting of these long-term contracts between IBM and NewCo, why would customers agree to do this without rebidding the contract or getting a price concession from either IBM or NewCo?\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Amit, this is Jim. Let me take your question and I appreciate the point. We are pretty pleased with the trajectory improvement overall with regards to our GBS business. We improved by 4 points quarter-to-quarter. And we talked about 90 days ago as we went through the pandemic, and Arvind reiterated it here on the call tonight. What we have seen is our clients\u2019 acceleration in their digital transformations and their journeys to cloud and we expected to capitalize on that as we move forward. So if you take a step back and just look at our first quarter performance and then I will translate that into what we see with our GBS business going forward, our first quarter performance really reflects a level in the confidence in the value of our portfolio, our cloud book of business in GBS doubled its growth rate to 28% here in the first quarter. We have over a $6 billion book of business in cloud and GBS alone, leveraging our strength and application modernization, and our cloud transformational services built on top of our Red Hat hybrid cloud platform. Our Red Hat engagements we increased 150 to let alone just in the first quarter overall and our cloud book of business is up double digits across all three subsectors. Now to your point about consulting, very pleased of that leading indicator, we returned back to growth. And we have been talking about the last handful of quarters, how the whole journey to cloud with our value proposition about our advise, move, build and manage that the front end of that equation as clients go through around application modernization really shows up in our consulting base of business and then translates into our application management business overall and our global processing services business overall, which we saw very nice growth as clients are reimagining how they run their companies and we are capitalizing on what we call intelligent work flows. So we definitely believe that consulting is the leading indicator.  Now, going forward we are very confident in getting back in second quarter to our pre-pandemic levels of growth. By the way, our backlog run-out in the next 90 days already shows that. But let me give you a little bit of some quantitative components behind why we are so confident. Number one, our book-to-bill over the last 12 months is well north of 1, led by consulting to your point, which we believe is the front end of that curve that will lend itself into GPS and into AMS, second, we continue to have very good momentum in small and midsized deals that you know has immediate revenue realization in the near-term, which is led, third, to our overall backlog level of growth, strong growth in GBS, consulting in GPS, and improving trend in our AMS business going forward, and fourth, we talked about up front we closed on five acquisitions here in the last handful of months, we are very focused on-ramping, scaling and driving that business. So we feel comfortable getting back to pre-pandemic growth here in second quarter. We feel very confident in the full year. GBS delivering growth, and most importantly, is that exit velocity in 2021 heading into 2022 GBS is an integral part of that mid single-digit growth objective that Arvind talked about.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Amit. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey. Thank you so much. Thanks, Pat. Just maybe a stupid question, clarification. Just the strength in System Z at this point in the cycle, what -- can you maybe go through that a little again? What\u2019s changed -- what\u2019s different, is it a different buying or selling motion, just trying to understand that a little bit better? And then just on the ecosystem strategy, Arvind, opening new areas of growth, is there a pipeline for more deals like a Palantir and others? I am just curious where the effort is there today and how close you are to adding more partners there or if that\u2019s more of a mid-term expectation for us to manage or watch for?\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Thanks, Tian-Tsin. I will handle the IBM Z discussion and then turn it over to Arvind for the ecosystem. We are very pleased. Seven quarters into a Z cycle growing 49% on a 60%-plus growth here in the first quarter of last year, very strong comparison overall and really kind of breaks the cycle from what we have typically seen. But we saw growth when you look at it, one, are we capitalizing on the overall encouraging trend from a macroeconomic perspective? Yes. We are also capitalizing on robust trading-based volumes in our traditional FSS-based industry. So capacity needs are driving some parts of our industry consumption. But I will tell you we are also seeing changing regulatory requirements, clients needing backup and recovery is very essential right now. We saw that play out in the first quarter. And then beyond the FSS industry, we start seeing some good adoption. And we talked about this in prior calls, where we see elongated cycles just given some industries are more impacted by the pandemic. But we see now our value proposition to cloud native applications where we have Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift that runs on our mainframe platform and also pervasive encryption. Security is at the top of every CIO and CTO\u2019s priority list, and the mainframe by definition is the most secure, most scalable, most reliable platform out there and I think you are seeing all of that play out.\nArvind Krishna: Yeah. On your second part of your question, Tian-Tsin, on ecosystem, yes, we have a long pipeline. I expect this number to go into the high 10s, maybe not 100, but definitely into very many more. Let me caution, though, when you say mid-term, it\u2019s not multiple years. Each of these takes about six months to become real and then another few months to become into real revenue. So I would not expect that new ones we announce now will have an impact much before the end of the year. However, they will have big impact at the very end of this year and into next year. So I will sort of position it like that. But expect that we should be announcing these at a regular cadence.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you very much. So you have made some high level but very consistent comments about sustaining the dividend as we approach the spin and I think most of us on the call understand the reasons for that. That said, in the past there have been some criticisms that the company has prioritized returns to shareholders at the expense of growth and I know you have talked a lot about reinvestment and cost savings among several other actions. However, in Software Cloud and Services you are going out against some pretty big companies that really don\u2019t return capital at your rates. So how do you want us to reconcile that dynamic as you look to reaccelerate and sustain growth in 2022 and beyond?\nJim Kavanaugh: So, David, this is Jim. Thank you for your question. Let me -- I am not going to talk to other competitors, but I would go check some of those about how much share buybacks they are all doing overall. But with that said, I am only going to talk about IBM. And we feel very confident in our capital allocation process and our disciplined financial management system overall.  Let me remind you 90 days ago how we entered the year. We entered the year I think I talked about the sources and uses of our cash. We think entering the year we had $14 -- over $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We said we were going to generate adjusted free cash flow of $11 billion to $12 billion in the year and that we were going to continue to optimize our IGF portfolio and set of offerings to be a captive aligned to our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and that would give us another $3 billion to $5 billion. So we had from a source perspective about $30 billion overall. When you take that against the uses in the year, we talked about a $3 billion charge for the structural actions in 2021 and our one-time charges for the separation that goes against that $30 billion. We talked about $8 billion of debt maturities against that and we talked about our dividend being $6 billion overall. So that comes up to be about, what, $16 billion, $17 billion. So we think from a cash source and use perspective, that we have got flexibility to continue to invest and compete in the market both organically and inorganically, while delevering to support a very strong balance sheet overall with a single A rating and also deliver given our investor base, deliver a secure and modestly growing dividend overall. And what you have seen in the first quarter I think only strengthens that position. We still ended the quarter with over $11 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And I will remind you that, we took into account $5 billion of debt maturity, $1.5 billion of dividend in the quarter, roughly $600 million under one-time charges and another $1 billion plus in acquisitions and still ended with $11 billion overall. So we feel very confident and we will capitalize whether there\u2019s any inorganic opportunities and you have seen, what, 11 acquisitions since Arvind has taken over. And we will continue to capitalize where it makes the right client value and the right IBM value at the right economic equation going forward. But we are not constrained by sources and uses of cash.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, David. Sheila, we are past the top of the hour, but why don\u2019t we take one more question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Thanks so much for fitting me in, Patricia. I appreciate it. Jim, I wanted to follow up on that question. If you could talk a little bit about the drivers of the change in underlying cash flow for this year, what are the key metrics and how should that make us think about your ability to generate cash in the next fiscal year, obviously I am eliminating the charges associated with the separation, if you could just talk about that? And then, Arvind, since I am last I wanted to sneak in one more. You have talked repeatedly about GBS growing in mid-single digits. Can you just talk about if I pick a number of 5%? If you could just clarify how much is M&A within that kind of number? And in particular, when you talk about application maintenance, are you assuming that application maintenance grows within GBS, because it\u2019s -- I think it\u2019s pretty clear that the industry is struggling for growth and if you are assuming that application maintenance can grow within the envelope of GBS, I\u2019d like to understand why when I think the industry faces challenges? Many thanks for taking my questions.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Keith, for the question overall. So let me handle the free cash flow and then Arvind can talk about GBS. As we said 90 days ago, which we reiterated here tonight on the call, we feel confident in the forward-looking guidance of $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow in \u201821. And if you remember 90 days ago, to give the investor a perspective of the sustainability just given the $3 billion worth of charges we would will have from the structural actions in the fourth quarter and the upcoming spin separation charges, we gave a perspective of 2022 that that would accelerate to $12 billion to $13 billion of adjusted free cash flow. When you look at the underpinnings of both \u201821 and then 2022, I think you start seeing the fundamentals of our business model. And that is returning back to revenue growth, the operating leverage that this business can generate with some level of sustainable level of revenue growth, the underlying mix contribution of that and the continued productivity that this business drives. You will see profit growth and also I remind you Red Hat, which we achieved be it free cash flow accretive in the first year will continue to drive improvements. Now, we have been making great progress on working capital efficiency and I would tell you our collections rate. We didn\u2019t talk about it, although in the prepared remarks. I talked about our record deferred income given the strength of our software renewal position overall. All of those will continue to generate improvements going forward. But that is going to be needed in 2021 because we got about $1 billion cash tax headwind with all of that in front of us. With I would say, probably, 60% to 70% will hit in the second quarter. So once we get through that cash tax headwind here, we feel pretty comfortable and confident in that cash generation machine, leveraging sustainable revenue growth and operating leverage in the business on our way to $12 billion to $13 billion next year.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks. And Keith, you asked one of our favorite questions, how is GBS going to grow and how much will it go? So when you look at the mid-single digits. That\u2019s actually our nearer term forecast. Our goals certainly are to make it grow even above that. If you look at the M&A component, look, I mean, M&A could contribute at most a couple of points to that growth. It just would be -- that would be sort of the upper bound and we won\u2019t necessarily see all of that even this year, but who knows, it -- because it\u2019s hard to predict how much those properties can grow once they are inside IBM as well. But you shouldn\u2019t expect more than that. But that\u2019s part of our path to make GBS grow faster even than the mid-single digits. In terms of AMS, AMS is really important for a number of reasons and it all depends on how you define it. If you define it as this is application management and maintenance of those applications that were in place five years ago, by definition that will shrink, because everybody expects massive productivity and they don\u2019t expect those to grow and you kind of see that in the numbers. But why is that incumbency relevant? As you have knowledge of that application base and you now help the client on their cloud transformation journey, then what was that older application asset now becomes a brand-new application estimate and you get growth, because you are helping them transform it using AI, using workflows, using cloud and so that contributes to growth, whether that shows up in consulting near-term and then AMS long-term, whether that shows up as global processes business services in the medium-term. That\u2019s the kind of mix that goes on. But that is why AMS is critical to giving GBS is kind of fuel in order to grow. But that is why we are confident in the mid-to-single -- mid-to-high single-digit growth in the longer term for GBS.\nArvind Krishna: So, Keith, thanks, but since we are well past the hour, let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. We had a good start to the year. We expect to continue our progress over the course of the year as we execute our strategy and realize benefits from the investments and actions we are taking. We will exit 2021 in a stronger position than we started the year and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Arvind. Sheila, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. I will get right into the numbers. In the first quarter, our revenue of $17.7 billion grew 1% as reported. We expanded our gross profit margin and grew gross profit dollars. We reported operating earnings per share of $1.77. Our adjusted free cash flow was up, resulting in $11.6 billion over the last year and our balance sheet and liquidity position remain strong. As Arvind said, we made progress, but more to do. You can see this progress in our revenue with an improvement in the trajectory of our constant currency results. Our revenue was up in Cloud & Cognitive Software and in Systems, and consulting returned to growth. We are capitalizing on clients' digital transformations and journeys to cloud. We take a platform approach to hybrid cloud and AI, with capabilities in infrastructure, software and cloud services. Across these, our cloud revenue was up 18% in the quarter and over the last twelve months, and now stands at over $26 billion for the last year. The fundamentals in our business model also continued to improve. We expanded operating gross profit margin this quarter by 110 basis points. I will remind you how we manage our business. We manage our services businesses at the gross margin level, while we look to capture the value of our product-based businesses at the pre-tax margin level. We had good margin expansion across our segments on those bases. This operating leverage enables a higher level of investment. We are investing in innovation, in skills and in our ecosystem as we execute on our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our hiring was up year-to-year, with thousands of people hired in the quarter. We closed six acquisitions since mid-December. We are building out pre-sales garages, adding go-to-market and delivery capabilities in GBS, and technical skills in Red Hat. And we are increasing R&D in areas like AI and quantum to drive innovation. Our year-to-year expense dynamics reflect this investment, though it was offset by lower workforce rebalancing charges year-to-year and lower travel expense in the current environment. Let me round out the financial highlights with some color on our strong free cash flow and balance sheet and liquidity position. We had a good start to the year with $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow, and $11.6 billion over the last year. This adjusted view excludes the cash impact of over $600 million for the structural actions initiated in the fourth quarter and transaction charges associated with the separation of our managed infrastructure services business. And as we complete the Form 10 process, which we are well on our way right now, Katy, I would tell you one as you know quite well, we will be transparent about the strategic commercial relationship we have between IBM and Kyndryl going forward and we will disclose what those relationships are and how we will treat that revenue. But more work to be done and we will come back to you at the appropriate time. Okay. Toni, thank you for your question. And I will handle the first part and provide some clarity around our forward-looking guidance and then turn it over to Arvind for your second part of the question. But as we said in prepared remarks, similar to 90 days ago, in fact we are even more confident in the position we put in place with regards to our two most important measures, one, revenue growth, and second, adjusted free cash flow, which is going to provide the fuel for the investments needed for us to capture that hybrid cloud $1 trillion TAM. Now, we reiterated that we are going to grow revenue overall for the year and that is despite currency volatility again with the U.S. dollar appreciating 90 days ago. We lost about a point of revenue for the year and we lost about a point of revenue in the second quarter. So now going to your math with regards to our historical quarter-to-quarter. Very close, I mean, the math I got in my head is somewhere around $900 million, $950 million give or take quarter-to-quarter. We see normal historical attainment across 1Q to 2Q in both our software base of business, as Arvind said. We are feeling even more confident given the rebound here in the first quarter and also in both of our services-based businesses, we see normal historical attainment to that roughly $900 million to $950 million. Now, given our first quarter performance of driving a very strong mainframe cycle growing 49% in the first quarter, in the seventh quarter of the program, which is unheard of coming off of 60% growth last year, Arvind and I both believe it's very prudent for us as we go forward with our guidance to not count on continued acceleration of our mainframe. We are very pleased with the performance. We are pleased with the value proposition. But I would say against that $900 million to $950 million, I would take a couple hundred million off of that number just based on first quarter's very strong performance in mainframe and that not concluding going forward. So let me turn it over to Arvind for the second part. Okay. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. Let me unpack some of this for you. First of all, printed numbers, signings down 27% to your point. Entirely driven by our large deal renewal comparison the last first quarter in GTS. If you remember, we signed two massive deals last year with Anthem and Caixa, well in excess of $1 billion a piece in each. But I think this goes to the testament that I have talked about many times on this call and that is all signings are not created equal. The duration, the mix, the offering, the content, all impact how signings translate into backlog and how backlog then translates into revenue realization overall. So let's talk a little bit about the GTS portfolio, because that's where it really centers around here in the quarter. When you look at GTS, I think, there's a couple different dynamics playing out. First, yes, greater than $100 million deals. We were down substantially compared to last year just off of that very tough compare and I will remind you we grew GTS signings north of 40% last year. So, second, though, is our mid-sized deals, read that kind of $10 million to $100 million. We were up high teens and embedded in that, we also had another nice quarter of new logos, which means we are out there winning new business, capturing new client value even in light of the announced separation with Kyndryl. The second component at the heart of your question I think is are we losing business or is business getting paused. I would think one with the new logo wins and, second, we have consistent high renewal rates in this business. This business is very sticky from a managed infrastructure services perspective and we have high 90%-plus renewal rates and we have not seen that change since the announcement. Now, with that said, are there pipeline that has built up that naturally some clients are pausing so they wait to see what our Form 10 is? Yeah. And I don't think we expected anything different overall. But when you take all that together, our backlog position overall in GTS and our backlog run out, we actually see continued sequential improvement, nice improvement off of fourth quarter, 3 points better and we see that continue modestly here from 1Q to 2Q. And that's a reflection of those new logos that are going to start ramping up and that's a reflection of our mid-sized deals which by the way has changed the duration in that part of the portfolio by one month overall which is impacting the revenue realization. So we still feel very good and very comfortable. We have got a very good pipeline in front of us and we see better revenue realization. Okay. Amit, this is Jim. Let me take your question and I appreciate the point. We are pretty pleased with the trajectory improvement overall with regards to our GBS business. We improved by 4 points quarter-to-quarter. And we talked about 90 days ago as we went through the pandemic, and Arvind reiterated it here on the call tonight. What we have seen is our clients' acceleration in their digital transformations and their journeys to cloud and we expected to capitalize on that as we move forward. So if you take a step back and just look at our first quarter performance and then I will translate that into what we see with our GBS business going forward, our first quarter performance really reflects a level in the confidence in the value of our portfolio, our cloud book of business in GBS doubled its growth rate to 28% here in the first quarter. We have over a $6 billion book of business in cloud and GBS alone, leveraging our strength and application modernization, and our cloud transformational services built on top of our Red Hat hybrid cloud platform. Our Red Hat engagements we increased 150 to let alone just in the first quarter overall and our cloud book of business is up double digits across all three subsectors. Now to your point about consulting, very pleased of that leading indicator, we returned back to growth. And we have been talking about the last handful of quarters, how the whole journey to cloud with our value proposition about our advise, move, build and manage that the front end of that equation as clients go through around application modernization really shows up in our consulting base of business and then translates into our application management business overall and our global processing services business overall, which we saw very nice growth as clients are reimagining how they run their companies and we are capitalizing on what we call intelligent work flows. So we definitely believe that consulting is the leading indicator.  Now, going forward we are very confident in getting back in second quarter to our pre-pandemic levels of growth. By the way, our backlog run-out in the next 90 days already shows that. But let me give you a little bit of some quantitative components behind why we are so confident. Number one, our book-to-bill over the last 12 months is well north of 1, led by consulting to your point, which we believe is the front end of that curve that will lend itself into GPS and into AMS, second, we continue to have very good momentum in small and midsized deals that you know has immediate revenue realization in the near-term, which is led, third, to our overall backlog level of growth, strong growth in GBS, consulting in GPS, and improving trend in our AMS business going forward, and fourth, we talked about up front we closed on five acquisitions here in the last handful of months, we are very focused on-ramping, scaling and driving that business. So we feel comfortable getting back to pre-pandemic growth here in second quarter. We feel very confident in the full year. GBS delivering growth, and most importantly, is that exit velocity in 2021 heading into 2022 GBS is an integral part of that mid single-digit growth objective that Arvind talked about. Okay. Thanks, Tian-Tsin. I will handle the IBM Z discussion and then turn it over to Arvind for the ecosystem. We are very pleased. Seven quarters into a Z cycle growing 49% on a 60%-plus growth here in the first quarter of last year, very strong comparison overall and really kind of breaks the cycle from what we have typically seen. But we saw growth when you look at it, one, are we capitalizing on the overall encouraging trend from a macroeconomic perspective? Yes. We are also capitalizing on robust trading-based volumes in our traditional FSS-based industry. So capacity needs are driving some parts of our industry consumption. But I will tell you we are also seeing changing regulatory requirements, clients needing backup and recovery is very essential right now. We saw that play out in the first quarter. And then beyond the FSS industry, we start seeing some good adoption. And we talked about this in prior calls, where we see elongated cycles just given some industries are more impacted by the pandemic. But we see now our value proposition to cloud native applications where we have Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Red Hat OpenShift that runs on our mainframe platform and also pervasive encryption. Security is at the top of every CIO and CTO's priority list, and the mainframe by definition is the most secure, most scalable, most reliable platform out there and I think you are seeing all of that play out. So, David, this is Jim. Thank you for your question. Let me -- I am not going to talk to other competitors, but I would go check some of those about how much share buybacks they are all doing overall. But with that said, I am only going to talk about IBM. And we feel very confident in our capital allocation process and our disciplined financial management system overall.  Let me remind you 90 days ago how we entered the year. We entered the year I think I talked about the sources and uses of our cash. We think entering the year we had $14 -- over $14 billion of cash on the balance sheet. We said we were going to generate adjusted free cash flow of $11 billion to $12 billion in the year and that we were going to continue to optimize our IGF portfolio and set of offerings to be a captive aligned to our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and that would give us another $3 billion to $5 billion. So we had from a source perspective about $30 billion overall. When you take that against the uses in the year, we talked about a $3 billion charge for the structural actions in 2021 and our one-time charges for the separation that goes against that $30 billion. We talked about $8 billion of debt maturities against that and we talked about our dividend being $6 billion overall. So that comes up to be about, what, $16 billion, $17 billion. So we think from a cash source and use perspective, that we have got flexibility to continue to invest and compete in the market both organically and inorganically, while delevering to support a very strong balance sheet overall with a single A rating and also deliver given our investor base, deliver a secure and modestly growing dividend overall. And what you have seen in the first quarter I think only strengthens that position. We still ended the quarter with over $11 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And I will remind you that, we took into account $5 billion of debt maturity, $1.5 billion of dividend in the quarter, roughly $600 million under one-time charges and another $1 billion plus in acquisitions and still ended with $11 billion overall. So we feel very confident and we will capitalize whether there's any inorganic opportunities and you have seen, what, 11 acquisitions since Arvind has taken over. And we will continue to capitalize where it makes the right client value and the right IBM value at the right economic equation going forward. But we are not constrained by sources and uses of cash. Thanks, Keith, for the question overall. So let me handle the free cash flow and then Arvind can talk about GBS. As we said 90 days ago, which we reiterated here tonight on the call, we feel confident in the forward-looking guidance of $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow in \u201821. And if you remember 90 days ago, to give the investor a perspective of the sustainability just given the $3 billion worth of charges we would will have from the structural actions in the fourth quarter and the upcoming spin separation charges, we gave a perspective of 2022 that that would accelerate to $12 billion to $13 billion of adjusted free cash flow. When you look at the underpinnings of both \u201821 and then 2022, I think you start seeing the fundamentals of our business model. And that is returning back to revenue growth, the operating leverage that this business can generate with some level of sustainable level of revenue growth, the underlying mix contribution of that and the continued productivity that this business drives. You will see profit growth and also I remind you Red Hat, which we achieved be it free cash flow accretive in the first year will continue to drive improvements. Now, we have been making great progress on working capital efficiency and I would tell you our collections rate. We didn't talk about it, although in the prepared remarks. I talked about our record deferred income given the strength of our software renewal position overall. All of those will continue to generate improvements going forward. But that is going to be needed in 2021 because we got about $1 billion cash tax headwind with all of that in front of us. With I would say, probably, 60% to 70% will hit in the second quarter. So once we get through that cash tax headwind here, we feel pretty comfortable and confident in that cash generation machine, leveraging sustainable revenue growth and operating leverage in the business on our way to $12 billion to $13 billion next year."

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Hello everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to be speaking with all of you again. In our last call, we shared our financial expectations for the year, revenue growth and $11 billion to $12 billion of adjusted free cash flow. While it's still early in the year and a lot remains to be done, we are confident enough to say that we are on track. Last quarter, I also talked about how the events of the last year have increased the needs for our clients to accelerate their digital transformations. This is continuing and the overall spend environment is improving, while there are some clear differences by geography and industry. With that as a backdrop, in the first quarter, we posted revenue growth at actual rates and grew free cash flow. We can see signs of progress in a number of areas. Our results in Cloud & Cognitive Software and Global Business Services revenue show that they are on an improved trajectory, including a return to growth in consulting. IBM Z again demonstrated its value as an enduring platform. Meanwhile, we improved margins in our Global Technology Services led by managed infrastructure services. As Jim will explain to you, all of this helped to deliver free cash flow improvement, which is a key focus area. As we move through the year, we will continue to execute on the important changes we are making to the company, from the acquisitions we are making, to the investments to expand our partner ecosystem, to the significant overhaul of our go-to-market model that we announced back in January, to the changes we are bringing to our culture to instill more of a growth mindset. Matt, thanks for the question. Look, I think, that the spend environment overall is improving, Matt. I think I can say that, definitely compared to the fourth quarter and we talked in the fourth quarter about various pauses in buying. We didn't really see that in the first quarter. Now that said, I do have to acknowledge there are some differences by geography and industry. When you look in the underlying results, you can see the Americas was stronger. There are pockets in Asia that depends very much by country and we can all guess which ones are doing better, which ones are doing worse. It does depend on both COVID rates and the pauses that happened then due to business circumstances. We do sense a bit of caution in Europe and you can see that in the numbers. So you can sort of expect that. You can also see that there are going to be differences by industry. Those most impacted are the obvious ones, travel, tourism and all others that then get touched by those. So that's a color of what's happening. However, as I have iterated before, we do see our clients accelerate their digital transformation and as they accelerate their digital transformation, our hybrid cloud thesis comes to play very strongly. Our multi-Cloud, which is multiple public Clouds, as well as private come into play. All the reasons that I mentioned around sovereignty and choice come into play and you can see that then in our Red Hat results.  So then explicitly addressing your Cloud & Cognitive Software, we expect Red Hat to maintain itself in the mid to high-teens. That will show through in the Cloud and Data platform results being strong. We expect our applications, our AI applications, to remain in the single-digit software growth, and we can see that, we talked about the strong demand for security in there. I do expect to see continued declines in our TPP software, but it doesn't really worry us. I mean, those are things where if I look at a two-year or three-year CAGR, we expect to see mid-to-high single-digit declines. But in any given period, it can be a little bit lumpy and we see that there. And so we expect this to carry on through this year. Second quarter, I would be somewhat optimistic, but we have got to go deliver it, Matt. Thanks, Katy. It's pretty clear you are a good student of what we say and publish. So let me try to unpack your question. Let me first talk about how do all these investments result in mid single-digit revenue growth. So if you look at it, we keep saying Red Hat at mid- to high-teens, leading to overall software in the mid-single digits. That will include the TPP mod decline but the overall will be mid single-digit. That could include I will call it any business as usual acquisitions. But the current market value, I don't see acquisitions adding a significant amount to IBM's topline. You can do the math with what we can put in. It will be well less than a point overall. We can just -- I think we can say that. Then if I look at our go to market investments, whether that's technical resources, garages, client success managers, our segmentation, that is not yet really paying off. We see some early signals in the 200 clients doing this. I do expect that can contribute a couple of points maybe a bit more for next year. But you will see that inside our software and our GBS numbers. It's not additive to those. We have also investing about $1 billion in our ecosystem. That will contribute to improving GBS growth rate to beyond the pre-pandemic rate. So that then takes me to GBS. We will this year come back to the pre-pandemic growth rates of $2 billion to $4 billion, but the mixture of the acquisitions and the go-to-market changes should take them higher than that by the end of the year into next year. Now, you asked also about will internal revenue contribute to this. Katy, the internal revenue is a one-time change. So we have talked about sustainable mid single-digit revenue growth not just for one year. So while it might help next year, we are not counting on that to be a contributor because it's only once. It's not every year. So, hopefully, Red Hat contributing together with the acquisitions of software in the mid-single digits, GBS with all the changes we are describing perhaps better than mid-single digits. Our systems if I take a two-year to three-year view kind of flattish, but in any given year it might increase or decrease but not by a whole lot. It doesn't impact the topline a lot and that's how sort of we get to the mid-single-digit sustainably. So you might get a one-year benefit from the -- from internal going to external, but not permanent. That's why I don't really count on that. Hopefully that gives you an answer to your different parts of the question. Thanks. So, Toni, Watson remains critically important to us. To be absolutely clear, Watson is the brand product name for our AI capabilities. You will see it in the market as Watson Conversational Agent, but you will also see it as, for example, our security products with Watson. It is embedded inside our Cloud Pak for data and called out as Watson. Let me give you a quick example of where we are seeing a huge amount of success. So let me take one of the large entities doing vaccine administration in the United States. When they were -- when they realized in December they could do this, they slowly began to realize that they could get tens of millions of calls every quarter and then how would they handle them? Staff of tens of thousands of people or perhaps deploy Watson. And so far at one of these places and we are deploying a lot more than one, 5 million calls handled in the quarter with over 70% handled by Watson. You now think about extrapolating this over the year. So that would make it 20 million in four quarters and with the confidence building up on one program you could imagine it going to others. This is a lot more straightforward to do and where I think AI excels in handling issues in both improving client satisfaction, because you get an instantaneous answer, but also in taking cost out and those are rare in our industry where you get both together. We see lots and lots of opportunities here. We also see a lot of Watson being embedded on how to automate data cleansing, on how to do AI operations, on dramatically improving the resilience of people's IT infrastructure. So, Toni, to net it out, Watson remains really important. AI is in the early parts of its journey. Not us, consultants have estimated $16 trillion of global productivity over the decade. We are maybe 5% of our way into that journey. Watson will be the tool that unlocks that for our clients albeit in areas like IT, in data, in conversation, in call handling and in all these areas where we excel and we have a large footprint with our clients. Thanks, Wamsi. Look, go-to-market changes, Wamsi, always have I will call it a bit of a hystericist loop. It takes time to take impact. We rolled them out in the beginning of January, but then you have to -- there's a human part to this. You have to assign people to accounts. There is some level of learning, there's some level of changes and all of that just takes months to flow through. I wish I could do it quicker, but I have got to acknowledge it takes months. That's why you hear me say it will take time for us to see the benefit.  Where will we see the benefit? We would expect to see improved productivity for our sales teams that cover our large accounts. That will result in better software growth and in better GBS growth. I do expect to see that in the second half. I expect to see even more of it going into 2022. As we are also investing in what we are calling our ecosystem, to be clear, that is investments whether it's in Schlumberger or Siemens or Palantir, just to name some from this last quarter. But before that, relationships we had with Box and Slack and Adobe and Salesforce and SAP. You expect to see all of those play out in the improved growth both in software and in GBS. So you kind of sort of unpack those and you see that. Now, when I talk about why would I see more productivity in our top accounts? Well, the 200 garage engagements that I mentioned, you expect that all of those will build pipeline, oftentimes we might never have had in the past. So that is why you begin to see improved yield in the top accounts. So I expect to see some definite, we will see it in our numbers in the second half and then more going into next year. For the second part of the question, I will hand it to Jim to talk a little bit about signings. Yeah. On your second part of your question, Tian-Tsin, on ecosystem, yes, we have a long pipeline. I expect this number to go into the high 10s, maybe not 100, but definitely into very many more. Let me caution, though, when you say mid-term, it's not multiple years. Each of these takes about six months to become real and then another few months to become into real revenue. So I would not expect that new ones we announce now will have an impact much before the end of the year. However, they will have big impact at the very end of this year and into next year. So I will sort of position it like that. But expect that we should be announcing these at a regular cadence. Thanks. And Keith, you asked one of our favorite questions, how is GBS going to grow and how much will it go? So when you look at the mid-single digits. That's actually our nearer term forecast. Our goals certainly are to make it grow even above that. If you look at the M&A component, look, I mean, M&A could contribute at most a couple of points to that growth. It just would be -- that would be sort of the upper bound and we won't necessarily see all of that even this year, but who knows, it -- because it's hard to predict how much those properties can grow once they are inside IBM as well. But you shouldn't expect more than that. But that's part of our path to make GBS grow faster even than the mid-single digits. In terms of AMS, AMS is really important for a number of reasons and it all depends on how you define it. If you define it as this is application management and maintenance of those applications that were in place five years ago, by definition that will shrink, because everybody expects massive productivity and they don't expect those to grow and you kind of see that in the numbers. But why is that incumbency relevant? As you have knowledge of that application base and you now help the client on their cloud transformation journey, then what was that older application asset now becomes a brand-new application estimate and you get growth, because you are helping them transform it using AI, using workflows, using cloud and so that contributes to growth, whether that shows up in consulting near-term and then AMS long-term, whether that shows up as global processes business services in the medium-term. That's the kind of mix that goes on. But that is why AMS is critical to giving GBS is kind of fuel in order to grow. But that is why we are confident in the mid-to-single -- mid-to-high single-digit growth in the longer term for GBS. So, Keith, thanks, but since we are well past the hour, let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. We had a good start to the year. We expect to continue our progress over the course of the year as we execute our strategy and realize benefits from the investments and actions we are taking. We will exit 2021 in a stronger position than we started the year and I look forward to continuing this dialogue with you."

We delivered strong revenue growth in our business. The growth was broad-based across our software, consulting, and infrastructure segments as well as across geographies. Our clients recognize that technology continues to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Over the last several quarters, it has become clear that technology is playing a significant role in boosting productivity in the face of inflation, demographic shifts, supply chain challenges and sustainability requirements. We entered 2022, a more focused company and took steps to reinforce our position. We strengthened our consulting expertise and expanded strategic partnerships. To bolster our software portfolio, we invested in hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. We also delivered significant innovations in infrastructure with our z16 and Power platforms. All of this was brought to market with a more technical and experiential sales approach. Looking back on the year, we are pleased with the progress we made. We delivered revenue growth above our mid-single-digit model and we delivered solid free cash flow. But I'll acknowledge there is more to do. This year, we'll unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships, and put more investment in specific growth markets. For 2023, we see revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range and about $10.5 billion of free cash flow. This keeps us on a path of sustainable growth. I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy. Our perspective is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the two most transformative technologies for business today. These technologies work together to drive business outcomes. Hybrid cloud is where the world is going. Containers are the preferred destination for applications. Hybrid cloud offers more value than relying on a singular public cloud. It enables organizations to drive business value across multiple clouds, on-premise or at the edge. This includes scale, security, ease of use, flexibility of deployment, seamless experiences and faster innovation cycles. Our platform, built on Red Hat, is the leading container platform, allowing clients to harness the power of open source software innovations. IBM software and infrastructure technologies have been optimized for this platform. Our consultants and others leverage their extensive technical and business expertise to accelerate clients' digital transformation journeys. Clients realizing real value from working with IBM's hybrid cloud platform approach. For example, we worked with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, CIBC, to adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Using Red Hat technology, CIBC manages and skills its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility. They can now develop applications in a private cloud and quickly deploy them to a public cloud. They deliver hundreds of new applications and reduced -- provisioning time by 95% and deployment time by 50%. We are helping Delta Airlines leverage hybrid cloud to modernize options, automate operations and integrate security. IBM Consulting deployed Red Hat on Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud Packs to provide a consistent platform. Delta now has more levers that can use to boost developer productivity, reduce time to market and improve employee satisfaction. CIBC and Delta are both great examples of the value hybrid cloud can provide. Let's now talk about artificial intelligence, or AI. AI is projected to contribute $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, including a massive boost in productivity by infusing AI into every enterprise process. We have been co-creating with many clients to deploy AI at scale. We automated the drive-through experience for quick-serve restaurants. We accelerated the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by automating the processes that assist millions of customers with inquiries and appointments. By applying AI and automation we have helped security analysts to use the time to respond to threats from hours or days, to minutes. Recently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office partnered with IBM to leverage a host of AI capabilities that make it easier for people to glean insights from their vast database of patents. The BBC is now using our AIOps software to automate the management of its IT infrastructure. For businesses, deploying AI can be challenging because it takes time to train each model. But by using large language models, companies can now create multiple models using the same data set. This means businesses can deploy AI with a fraction of the time and resources. That is why we are investing in large language, our foundation models for our clients and have infused these capabilities across our AI portfolio. Our partner ecosystem plays a critical role in the execution of our strategy. In the fourth quarter, we made a series of new IBM software offerings available as-a-Service in the AWS marketplace. Likewise, Red Hat continued the expansion of its offerings in hyperscaler marketplaces, making Ansible Automation Platform available on both Azure and AWS. Adobe and Salesforce are also leveraging open source innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings. Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP, Microsoft and AWS, all over $1 billion in revenue for the year. We've had great success with our strategic partners and as we enter the New Year, we are expanding and better enabling our broader ecosystem. Recently launched Partner Plus, a new simplified program that increases our reach and scale through new and existing IBM partners. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we introduced Red Hat Device Edge, a lightweight solution to flexibly deploy traditional or containerized workloads on small devices such as robots, IoT gateways, point-of-sale and public transport. We also formed a collaboration with the Japanese consortium, Rapidus to leverage the depth of our intellectual property on advanced semiconductors. We unveiled Osprey, a 433-qubit quantum processor, that brings us closer to delivering our goal of building a 1,000 qubit system later this year. At the same time, we continue to acquire companies to complement our organic innovation. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Octo, which improves our footprint in the US federal market. This caps the year with eight acquisitions across software and consulting. As sustainability becomes more of a priority, companies need digital technologies to analyze data, creating a baseline and improve the way they operate. Our software has helped IBM reduce its own carbon footprint. Across IBM's global real estate presence, we were able to reduce carbon emissions by over 61% when compared to 2010. Using IBM sustainability software, we have simplified and automated our sustainability reporting processes and reduced reporting costs by 30%. Let me wrap by saying I'm pleased with the progress we have made with our portfolio, our go-to-market and our ecosystem. I'm confident in our ability to leverage hybrid cloud and AI to help clients turn business challenges into opportunities. Our strategy continues to strongly resonate with clients and partners, and this gives us a solid foundation to build upon in this year. While there is more to be done, we enter the New Year as a more capable and nimble company, well-equipped to meet our clients' needs. I will now turn it over to Jim who will give you more detailed information on our performance and expectations.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, $3.8 billion of operating pre-tax income and operating earnings per share of $3.60. In our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated $5.2 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up over 6% at constant currency. While the dollar weakened a bit from 90 days ago, it still impacted our reported revenue by over $1 billion and 6.3 points of growth. As always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. And I'll remind you that we wrapped on the separation of Kyndryl at the beginning of November. The one-month contribution to our fourth quarter revenue growth was offset by the impact of our divested health business. Revenue growth this quarter was again broad-based. Software revenue was up 8% and consulting up 9%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 7%. Within each of these segments, our growth was pervasive. We also had good growth across our geographies, with mid single-digit growth are better in Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. And for the year, we gained share overall. We had strong transactional growth in software and hardware to close the year. At the same time, our recurring revenue, which provides a solid base of revenue and profit also grew, led by software. I'll remind you that on an annual basis, about half of our revenue is recurring. Over the last year, we've seen the results of a more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our approach to hybrid cloud is platform-centric. As we land a platform, we get a multiplier effect across software, consulting and infrastructure. For the year, our hybrid cloud revenue was over $22 billion, up 17% from 2021. Looking at our profit metrics for the quarter, we expanded operating pre-tax margin by 170 basis points. This reflects a strong portfolio mix and improving software and consulting margins. These same dynamics drove a 60 basis point increase in operating gross margin. Our expense was down year-to-year driven by currency dynamics. Within our base expense, the work we're doing to digitally transform our operations provides flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and in talent. Our operating tax rate was 14% which is flat versus last year. And our operating earnings per share of $3.60 was up over 7%. Turning to free cash flow. We generated $5.2 billion in the quarter and $9.3 billion for the year. Our full year free cash flow is up $2.8 billion from 2021. As we talked about all year, we have a few drivers of our free cash flow growth. First, I'll remind you, 2021's cash flow results included Kyndryl related activity including the impact of spin charges and CapEx; second, we had working capital improvements driven by efficiencies in our collections and mainframe cycle dynamics. Despite strong collections, the combination of revenue performance above our model and the timing of the transactions in the quarter led to higher-than-expected working capital at the end of the year. This impacted our free cash flow performance versus expectations. Our year-to-year free cash flow growth also includes a modest tailwind from cash tax payments and lower payments for structural actions, partially offset by increased CapEx investment for today's IBM. In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested $2.3 billion to acquire eight companies across software and consulting, mitigated by over $1 billion in proceeds from divested businesses, and we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong liquidity position with cash of $8.8 billion, this is up over $1 billion year-to-year and our debt balance is down nearly $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and I say the same for our retirement-related plans. At year-end, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 114%, with the US at 125%. Both are up year-to-year. You'll recall, back in September, we took another step to reduce the risk profile of our plans. We transferred a portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan obligations to insurers, without changing the benefits payable to plan participants. This resulted in a significant non-cash charge in our GAAP results in the third quarter, and we'll see a benefit in our non-operating charges going forward. You can see the benefit of this and other pension assumptions to the 2023 retirement-related costs in our supplemental charts. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 8%, fueled by growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing. We concluded the year with seasonally strong transactional performance as well as a solid and growing recurring revenue base in software. In hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 10%, with pervasive growth across our business areas: Red Hat, automation, data and AI and security. Our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI is resonating with clients. As a proof point, OpenShift, our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform now has $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, and we modernize and optimize our software capabilities, including through cloud packs across automation, data and AI and security for that platform. Red Hat revenue grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in OpenShift and Ansible, both growing double digits and gaining market share. Automation revenue was up 9%. Growth was led by business automation, application servers and integration as clients look to automate business workflows and improve applications. Data and AI revenue grew 8% with enterprise needs to organize, store and manage their data. This performance reflects demand in areas including data management, data fabric and asset and supply chain management. Security delivered 10% revenue growth. We're helping clients detect, prevent and respond to security incidents, which led to strength across threat management, data security and identity. Across these businesses, the annual recurring revenue or ARR for hybrid platform and solutions is $13.3 billion. And for all of software, hybrid cloud revenue is now more than $9.3 billion over the last year, up 16%. In transaction processing, revenue was up 3%. Demand for this mission-critical software has followed increases in Z Systems installed base capacity over the last couple of product cycles and strong renewal rates continued this quarter. Both are evidence of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment. Moving to software profit. Our pre-tax margin was up 2 points this quarter, contributing to a full year margin of nearly 25%. Consulting revenue grew 9%. Clients are leveraging IBM's hybrid cloud leadership and deep industry expertise to navigate the complexity of their digital transformation journeys. Revenue growth was broad-based across all business lines and geographies. And I'll remind you that this is on top of the 16% growth consulting delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021. Strong demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 17%. With this, fourth quarter had the best quarterly book-to-bill of the year, and we sequentially improved our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio to 1.1. Clients are partnering with IBM Consulting as they decide what applications to modernize and how to migrate those applications across hybrid, multi-cloud environments. Over the last 12 months, consulting delivered $9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 23%. This quarter, our Red Hat practice was again a meaningful contributor to this growth. Revenue from strategic partnerships also grew at a strong double-digit rate. We continue to see momentum in this space. In aggregate, our strategic partnership bookings were up over 50% with Azure and AWS more than doubling. Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 7%. Growth in business transformation was once again driven by data and client experience transformation along with supply chain and finance optimization. Our partnerships with key ISV partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe enable IBM Consulting to transform critical workloads at scale. In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 10%. Growth was led by cloud application development practices. Red Hat engagements along with our strategic hyperscaler partnerships contributed to the growth. Application operations revenue grew 12%. We help clients to optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environment. Our incumbency and understanding of clients' applications are key differentiators.  Moving to consulting profit. Our pre-tax margin was 11% for the quarter and nearly 9% for the year. The fourth quarter margin is up nearly 2 points year-to-year and over 1 point sequentially. We are starting to see the benefit from pricing actions and productivity and our acquisitions have become more accretive. Turning to Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 7% driven by hybrid infrastructure, which was up 11%. Within hybrid infrastructure, Z systems revenue grew 21% this quarter. Among the new z16 capabilities, clients are leveraging cyber resiliency to comply with business regulations and proactively avoid outages in their operation and the new on-chip AI accelerator, for example, has been helping mitigate risk and detect fraud in credit card application processes. Our distributed infrastructure revenue was up 5%. This performance was fueled by strength in power following the extension of Power 10 innovation throughout the product line. Infrastructure support performance was flat including the impact from client adoption of new hardware with the latest z16 product cycle. Moving to infrastructure profit. Pre-tax margin was down less than 1 point in the quarter. And for the full year, our pretax margin was nearly 15%. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. At our investor briefing 15 months ago, we laid out our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and our priorities of revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Since then, we've been focused on our portfolio, our go-to-market model, our ecosystem and our capital allocation to execute that strategy and create value through focus. We now just completed the first year as today's IBM. Our 2022 revenue was up nearly 12%, including nearly 4 points of incremental Kyndryl contribution that's above our model of mid-single-digit growth. Over 70% of our revenue was in our growth vectors of software and consulting and about half of our revenue is recurring. With this high-value mix and contribution from the incremental Kyndryl revenue, we expanded our full year operating pre-tax margin by 2.5 points. And our free cash flow was $9.3 billion, up $2.8 billion from the prior year. We invested organically and inorganically and return significant value to shareholders through dividends. Now there were some external factors that we faced this past year that impacted our profit and cash. We exited a profitable business in Russia. We are dealing with a much stronger dollar, and we are operating in a highly inflationary environment, which put pressure on our margins, especially in consulting. Putting it all together, we are pleased with the fundamentals of our business and the progress we have made in executing our strategy. Our 2022 performance demonstrates that we now have a higher growth, higher value company with higher return on invested capital and a strong and growing free cash flow. For 2023, we again expect solid growth in our two most important measures of success; revenue and free cash flow. Arvind talked about the important role technology plays in this environment and how our solutions are closely aligned to the needs of our clients. With this, we expect constant currency revenue growth for the year to be in line with our mid-single-digit model. As we enter this year, I think it's prudent to expect the low-end of the mid single-digit model. And for free cash flow, we'd expect to generate about $10.5 billion in 2023, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Let me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pre-tax profit performance by segment. In software, with continued momentum in our recurring revenue stream in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, we expect revenue growth in line with software's mid single-digit model. This revenue growth generates operating leverage, and we'd expect software pre-tax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. Consulting's model is to deliver high single-digit revenue. We're coming off a strong year with revenue growth of 15% as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and strong book-to-bill ratio support consulting revenue growth at the high-end of its model despite the tough compare. We expect to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least 1 point as we continue to realize more of the price increases and improved utilization. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're entering the year three quarters into the z16 cycle, and will also ramp on Power 10. As a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue below its model and pre-tax margin in the low-teens. For perspective, infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point. That's in line with our model and our tax rate should be in the mid- to high-teens range. Let me comment on a few items within our expectations. First, as I said, currency was a significant headwind in 2022, impacting revenue by $3.5 billion. With the movement of spot rates over the last 90 days, currency translation would be fairly neutral to revenue in 2023 with a headwind in the first half, flipping to a tailwind in the second. But I'll remind you that we had over $650 million of hedging gains in 2022, which will not repeat in 2023, resulting in an impact to our profit and cash on a year-to-year basis. Second, as you know, we've taken a number of significant portfolio actions over the last couple of years, which has resulted in some stranded cost in our business. We expect to address these remaining stranded costs early in the year and anticipate a charge of about $300 million in the first quarter. We would start to see benefits in the second half and pay back by the end of the year. And then third, we regularly review the useful lives of our assets. Due to advances in technology, we are making an accounting change to extend the useful life of our server and networking equipment effective the 1st of January. Based on our year-end asset base, we expect this change to benefit 2023 pre-tax profit by over $200 million, primarily in our Infrastructure segment. Given this is a change to the depreciation, there's no benefit to cash. Looking at the first quarter, our constant currency revenue growth should be fairly consistent with the full year. Reported growth will also include about a three-point currency headwind at current spot rates. With operating leverage, we'd expect operating pre-tax margin to expand 50 to 100 basis points in the first quarter. And that's before the charge I just mentioned for the remaining stranded costs. Given the timing of currency and stranded cost dynamics, we'd expect about one-third of our net income in the first half and about two-thirds in the second half. To sum it all up, we have made a lot of progress this past year. While there's always more work to do, we're confident in the fundamentals of our business, and how we're positioned as we enter the New Year. Patricia, let's go to the Q&A.\nPatricia Murphy : Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information for the quarter and the year is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot for taking my question. I guess my question is around the free cash flow numbers. And perhaps you could spend a little bit of time on, you touched on kind of the 22 levers a fair bit and how you got there. But as you think about calendar 2023 free cash flow of $10.5 billion, upwards of $1.2 billion. What are the puts and takes? What are the bridge that gets you there? And then maybe related to that, as I think about what you did in 2022 and 2023, it does imply to get to the $35 billion number over the three years, 2024 would have to be $14 billion plus. So perhaps you can level set that because I do think from, when you provided the $35 million number, a fair bit has changed. So maybe a bridge for 2023 and just an update on how you think about the $35 billion number over three years as well? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh : Thanks, Amit. This is Jim. I appreciate the question. So let's start there. We saw a solid free cash flow generation in 2022, up $2.8 billion year-over-year. Now as you remember, we entered 2022. We talked about a very strong free cash flow generation engine. And we put in place a guidance for 2022 well in excess of our model of $750 million year-to-year. First, as we were very transparent, we were going to get at least about half of that out of the Kyndryl related spin dynamics. That's the charges and CapEx. And we were going to get a little bit more than half of that out of our base operations overall. And I think when you look at 2022, what happened we got impacted by two external factors. Number one, the unfortunate humanitarian crisis with the war in Russia and Ukraine, and we exited that business, the right decision. Second is unprecedented US dollar appreciation. I think last time I looked, the rate, the breadth, the magnitude of the change is the most we've seen in multiple decades. We got hit with that. But we're able to overcome some of that with the fundamental underpinnings of our business overall and still delivered almost $3 billion of free cash flow year-over-year. By the way, Russian currency by themselves is over $600 million of profit and cash we had to absorb. So now to your question about 2023, we guided, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a $10.5 billion, that's up $1.2 billion year-over-year, and again, above our $750 million year-to-year. The underpinnings of that, though, are going to be very different in 2023. Given the improving business fundamentals of our now sustainable revenue growth with a high value mix contribution, we see then continued operating leverage. So our cash PTI is going to deliver a substantial amount of that free cash flow generation year-over-year. We're still going to get working capital efficiency. So our realization will definitely be up over 100%. But that's really given the volume dynamics of what happened in the fourth quarter with a very strong and accelerated growth profile as we went through fourth quarter, we finished extremely strong on our transactional business in the month of December. So that now creates an opportunity for free cash flow generation in 2023 and that's in our guidance. And then there are some other puts and takes. Yes, we'll get modest structural actions tailwind, but they're going to be offset by a cash tax headwind for the year. So that kind of plays out 2022 and 2023 now. How does that relate to a mid-term model? First of all, we're one year into that mid-term model. And as I talked about, the dynamics in dealing with the decision to exit our Russia business and the significant US dollar appreciation, I quantified it for you over a $600 million impact on profit and cash. But as you all know quite well, that's not a one-time impact, that will continue over a multi-period and it definitely puts pressure on our mid-term model to the tune cumulatively about over $2.5 billion. So, we are entirely focused on how we execute this company on a sustainable revenue growth profile and generating that $10.5 billion of free cash flow. So it enables us, with the right ample financial flexibility, to continue to invest in our business and return value to our shareholders overall.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Amit. Sheila, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi, yes. Thank you. Arvind, nice to see the revenue guide here. I was wondering if you could share some thoughts around what's happening in software, in particular, you've had a really strong performance in transaction processing over the past year. How are you thinking about the trajectory of that? I know historically, we've kind of thought about this as mid-single-digit or higher decliner, and clearly, we're tracking very differently here. If you could share some thoughts around the trajectory of that in 2023 and beyond, that would be very helpful. Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Yeah. Thanks Wamsi, for the question. So, I'll address your transaction processing question first and then all of software right after that. So some of you have heard me talk about that transaction processing would be a mid-single-digit decliner in the past. And that's effectively, Wamsi, is what you asked, what's going to be different. As we look at our business there and we look both at the underlying MIPS growth, as well as the criticality of that software, as well as our ability to have some very modest pricing uplift, we would now look at that business as being a slight increaser as opposed to a modest decliner. So, I think, if you are looking at that one, Wamsi, low single-digit increases for transaction processing is what we think is appropriate for the short to medium-term model looking forward. Now, that does help in overall software. So first, let's look at software and decompose it. Software, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, is almost 80% recurring revenue. We see that recurring revenue increasing consistent with our model of the mid-single digits, based on both the consumption, the usage, as well as what we have seen through '22 in people renewing that base of software business. Then, I will acknowledge to you that '22 was a great ELA year, '23 will be not as good as '22. But with the transactional piece of the business being less than 20%, that has a much smaller impact on the overall growth rate. As you put all that together, we see the mid-single digits as being appropriate for the software business.\nPatricia Murphy: Excellent. Thank you, Wamsi. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could just comment on operating profit more broadly. I think your target at the beginning of the year was for operating profit to improve 400 basis points, and it came in at 270. I think your target for the fourth quarter was 250 basis point improvement in operating margin and came in at 170. And so -- and that's manifesting itself into a free cash flow number that was lower than you had expected and this year and potentially for next year relative to your $35 billion target. So, you have a dual mandate, Arvind. One is to try and grow mid-single digits and the other is to deliver very strong cash flow, which is impacted by margins. The margin was not as strong this year, and I'm wondering, if you can highlight what was different from your expectations? And what were the challenges in forecasting that and how investors should think about that and free cash flow realization going forward?\nArvind Krishna: Yes. Toni, thanks. So, you're completely accurate that these numbers are slightly below our expectations from the beginning of the year. I will ask Jim to comment and give you a lot more color on it. But let me first comment on your statement of, we have a double mandate of revenue growth and free cash flow growth, but I want to also be clear, revenue growth has -- which manifests itself in client satisfaction, higher NPS from our clients, better consumption of both software and consulting from our clients, which allows them to consume more and more over time is what we are focused on. And it's an and we have to deliver the free cash flow growth. Jim mentioned in a response to the first question that we were not expecting the business and Russia to get shut down, that impacted it a little bit. We were not expecting the currency headwinds to be as severe as it turned out to be. That's certainly impacted. And I'll acknowledge, an inflation as in wage inflation showed up and impacted our margins in consulting a lot more than we were expecting. Now an answer could have been to not hire people and to not give that but that would have resulted then in lower capacity at the end of this year, which would not have allowed us the confidence into the growth, both in consulting and in software that we are now committing for 2023. So as we balance those, it becomes a business decision to say, we are going to keep going on increasing capacity, which results in healthier revenue and it will result in improving margins, but that flows through into 2023 as opposed to giving it all to us in 2022. So Toni, that's kind of how we think about balancing the investments in the business versus a quarterly result. And I'll ask Jim to comment a bit more on some of the specifics of what you were asking.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Just to put some numbers around this, Toni, you're exactly right. We entered the year. We talked about a business profile, higher revenue growth company, higher operating margins, strong free cash flow yield. And we had guided at mid single-digit revenue growth, and we guided that four points of operating margin improvement. The two points of external that both Arvind and I have both talked about Russia and currency. By the way, that was about 0.5 point because currency member, as we've talked about many times throughout these calls, not only the rate breadth and velocity and change in magnitude that we haven't seen in about two to three decades, but it impacts human capital-based consulting business very differently than a product technology-based business. As we talk about human capital is all pretty much a natural hedge because your cost is basically matched with your revenue outside of global delivery. But in a product-based business, our costs like the industry is predominantly US dollar source, and that's why you've seen pressure on the gross profit margin line and the pre-tax profit margin line around our technology base of business. Now underlying that though, I think you're seeing a fundamental improvement in our margins as we go forward. So about 50 basis points of currency. The remaining 100 basis points was consulting. And we talked about that. That's been a rate and pace discussion. You dial back 15, 18 months ago, we called a very accelerated demand environment of our clients shifting to digital transformation and journey to cloud. And starting in the second half of 2021, we made the bet to make investments around skill capability ecosystems, and we opened up the aperture to build extended capabilities inorganically. And we knew as we went through 2022 that we then we're operating in a highly inflationary environment. And then it became a rate and pace discussion on how quick can you get price margin and optimization and realize through your backlog. And I think we've acknowledged that we were pretty slow throughout the year. Now with that said, we finished the year about nine points of margin in consulting. We had nice improvement. We exited fourth quarter at 11-point PTI model that was up almost 200 basis points year-over-year, our first half to second half, we saw an acceleration of three points of margin from about a seven-point operating PTI model to well over 10 points of an operating PTI model. And most importantly, the green shoots are starting to play out in the fourth quarter. Our utilization of effective capacity, one of the three levers we talked about all year, up three points in the fourth quarter. Our price margins, third consecutive quarter are up year-to-year, and you're seeing that play out in that operating profit performance. And finally, acquisitions. Now, we're on a steady state and our acquisitions are back to accretion. So, we see nice green shoots that lead to our guidance in 2023 at the high end of our high single-digit model in consulting on revenue coming off of a very strong 15% growth in 2022 and guiding another one point plus in operating margins going forward.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks for the question Toni. Let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Shannon, we\u2019re not able to hear you in conference, please shift the mute feature on your phone.\nShannon Cross: Hi, can you hear me?\nOperator: Yes, we can hear you now. You may go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Okay. Interesting. Yes. Arvind, can you talk a bit about AI and how it runs through your business? There's obviously so much discussion right now about OpenAI and Microsoft making investments? And I guess I'm trying to think about how we should think about IBM monetizing it, capitalizing on it, how you think about your competitive position relative to others. I don't know if there are examples you can give where you're utilizing it. But I'm just -- I'm wondering, as AI gets more and more of a -- becomes more and more of a discussion point apparently for 2023 and you have such a long history with it, how we should think about where you are now and where you're going to take it? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks Shannon. So, first, let me acknowledge AI has become a big topic of conversation this year. I was in Davos last week, and it probably came up at almost every single discussion around technology, what's happening with AI as well as what's happening with OpenAI. If I think about it over the last decade, I think there were three moments you can talk about, and then I'll begin to translate those into a business impact. One, when IBM won Jeopardy! with Watson, I think it was a big moment, and AI came on to everyone's roadmap. Second, when deep mind from Google or Alphabet started winning competitions around, for example, GO, and that became another big moment along with the protein folding that they did and now with OpenAI and ChatGPT. But if I step back just a moment, all of this latest version is based on what is called large language models as the underlying science. Universities do it, Google does it, IBM does it as does OpenAI. To just get to why it's so exciting. For example, for us, it allows us to do 13 language models when we are looking at understanding different natural languages in the same cost as originally one. That is what is so exciting about these technologies because if you can get an order of magnitude improvement in cost and speed and the resource consumed, both in terms of hardware and people, that is incredibly exciting. Now, let me translate this into how do we monetize this. So, our monetization of AI is very much focused on that $16 trillion of productivity that I've talked about that we're going to get over the decade. The vast majority of that comes from enterprise automation, and when I say enterprise, I include governments into it. Some examples, if you can automate the drive-through and order taking for quick-serve restaurants, that's an example of what can happen. If we can get deflection rates of 40%, 50%, 60% at everyone's call centers, that's a massive operational efficiency for all of our clients. If we can help retirees get their pensions through interacting with a Watson-powered AI chatbot that is an enterprise use case where all of these technologies come into play. By the way, all my three examples are real clients where we are resulting in anywhere from hundreds to thousands of people, efficiency for each of these clients. So that's how we get it. If I look inside IBM, how we do promotions, how we do people movement, how we begin to improve our code to cash, how we improve our customer service and people ask complicated questions around triage of IT systems going down are all very real examples where we are improving client service and saving money all at the same time.\nPatricia Murphy: Shannon, thank you very much. Sheila, can we go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErik Woodring: Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just touch on the consulting business. Signings were very strong in the December quarter, up 17%. Your quarterly book-to-bill was an improvement from the September quarter. Can you maybe just, again, just step back and elaborate on the environment, what we're in, what you saw in 4Q that potentially stood out to you where strength in signings is coming from changes to contract duration? Maybe just double-clicking on the consulting business. Just to help us understand what gives you confidence to be kind of at the high end of your midterm model for 2023? Thanks.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Eric, for the question. I'll take this. When we entered the fourth quarter, we had a pretty solid pipeline. And we talked about reaffirmed mid-teens growth for consulting for the year, which as you know, is well above our model. But again, as I talked about on the previous question, we had made the investments in bringing in skill capability, expanding ecosystem, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. But we saw that pipeline entering the quarter we saw a very solid and pretty disciplined sales closure rate as we move through the year. Now, how did the year end that positions us for 2023 and let me just put some stats to really bring it home. Number one, ecosystem velocity, we saw continue to increase throughout the year of our strategic partnerships. I think we said in the prepared remarks, strategic partnerships, one grew revenue 25% in 2022 and was about 40% of our consulting base of business. That is up about 50% year-over-year. We have saw \u2013 seen extensive acceleration. And by the way, in the fourth quarter, our signings growth which delivered a 1.3 book-to-bill, our hyperscaler partnerships with Azure and with AWS, our signings were 2x. And our ISV portfolio with the likes of SAP, Salesforce, Adobe, we were up over 50% in signings. So our book of business and the partnerships we have tremendous strength that's fueling our backlog, point number one. Point number two, Red Hat. We continue to see acceleration of consulting being the tip of the spear that's really driving the scale and adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. And oh, by the way, is also dragging IBM technology and software. Since inception, a little over three years, we signed $7.4 billion of business in Red Hat, tremendous strength and that, again, fuels our backlog for 2023. And then you look at full year, we grew both large transformational deals, and we grew small deals double digit, both sides. So it's pervasive across the board. So when we look at our backlog, we look at all of our indicators of our business on the realization of that model. We look on the acquisition portfolio and how it's scaling. We feel pretty confident about the high end of our high single-digit model in 2023. Oh, by the way, to Toni's question, at operating margins being accretive.\nPatricia Murphy: Erik, thanks for the question. Let\u2019s go to the next one please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with SVB MoffettNathanson. Your line is open.\nLisa Ellis: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe following on that, I had a broader question, Arvind, on the overall demand environment you're seeing. I think with earnings coming in from various enterprise tech players so far, we're seeing a pretty wide range of signals about how the demand environment is shaping up for 2023. Can you just comment a bit on what you're seeing from your large clients, say, relative to this past year? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Yeah. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Look, if I think about our overall client base, we were first really pleased that there wasn't much of a difference by geography. As I go through it, Japan, India, Australia, the Middle East, Western Europe, the UK, North America were really pretty strong in demand across. So I think Lisa, if I break it down into the two portions around technology and consulting, what we are seeing is that most of our clients do believe, but even if there are some I call the minor or different headwinds in 2023, they are going to emerge stronger. As they want to emerge stronger, that means they're all deploying technology to help offset wage inflation, cyber issues, supply chain challenges and all the demographic shifts, meaning there's just fewer skilled people to hire. Consequently, we're seeing them double down, and that is why we have focused on certain areas and certain partners, both for consulting and in technology. So they all want to deploy automated ways to get from the front to the back maybe Salesforce and Adobe play a very strong role in that. They all want to leverage cloud technologies that they can scale technology up to better handle client demand. Our partnerships with the hyperscalers play into that. They all want to leverage far more technology than they have before to counteract the wage inflation and other inflationary aspects and what we do with Red Hat plays into that. So I kind of see, Lisa, that all of our clients play into that. Now you've mentioned a wide spectrum from the people you're seeing recently, I think the reason that we are remaining in this optimistic frame of mind, we have no consumer business. I agree that our clients may have a consumer business, but we don't have that directly. And so I think consequently, we might be seeing a little bit different subset of the economy than those who might have a large direct exposure to a consumer business.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Lisa. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. So you had a very good transactional momentum in the software business in the fourth quarter, and you provided some good high-level commentary in your prepared remarks about the business and the broad-based growth may reflect many of those changes that you've been talking about in the go-to-market strategy and sales changes. That said, Arvind, can you talk specifically or identify any product-specific changes in software that you think may be driving that momentum and that may suggest your competitive positioning is shifting in any of those three non Red Hat segments. And then just one other thing -- just sorry about the two-part question, but just for Jim, I just wanted to clarify with that working capital headwind in the fourth quarter that you talked about reverses in 2023. Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Yes. Thanks, David. Let me talk a little bit about the product capabilities. And as you said outside Red Hat called focus on automation, data AI and cyber. If I look at those, let's take automation. I'm really pleased with the progress we have made around an area I\u2019ll call AIOps. But if you think about, we made a couple of small acquisitions Instana and Turbonomics, we built our own AIOps portfolio. And we're seeing tremendous pickup from that as our clients want to take out labor complexity but also want to optimize their overall IT infrastructure, hardware and software. They also want to have uptime that is now the talk about not just 2 9s and 3 9s, but up to 5 9s. And they also want to worry about how to make sure some go to always on. And so I think our AIOps portfolio there really advantages us, and I believe we're in a unique position because we help our clients in an environment across multiple public clouds and on-premise, and with their private clouds in that space. If I think about data and AI, our focus on data fabric and allowing our clients to leverage the data wherever it is, not always moving it, but allowing them to catalog it, leveraging AI, deep inside our products is another example of where we have a unique capability. And third, if I look at cyber, we focus a lot on threat management. And if we think about how we can leverage the inputs from all kinds of sources in these days, and people are really worried about all of the threats coming, whether from nation states, all from just bad actors, then it allows them to leverage that portfolio better. Consequently, we're going to remain pretty focused on these areas. You should expect both organic and inorganic investment. And David, I can't help us say, we are giving our clients the ability to deploy these capabilities on multiple public clouds as well as on-premise and I believe that does advantage them because it gives them a lot more flexibility and freedom than they might have from some other vendors.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. I would just build on that, Arvind. I mean, Software book of business today, it's an integral part of our hybrid cloud platform thesis. It is the foundation. We eclipsed $25 billion for the first time ever here in 2022. So over 40% of IBM's revenue and two-thirds of our EBITDA. So when you look at it, we are a hybrid cloud AI platform-centric company overall and software is right at that course. So why that recurring revenue stream and the improvements we've been seeing throughout 2022. And as Arvind answered earlier, getting that back to a growing contribution, not only helps the competitiveness and market share of our top line, but I think all of you understand the marginal dollar of that book of business is in the 90-plus percent range, as we move forward. So David, I think you also asked a question about clarification. Free cash flow growth, $10.5 billion about, up $1.2 billion year-to-year, above our model of $7.50 billion. That will be driven based on the fundamental improvements of our underlying revenue growth and operating leverage and cash PTI, but there will also be, yes, a working capital efficiency contribution to our cash generation next year, really just the volume dynamics of what played out in the fourth quarter. We'll get that back.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, David. We are past the top of the hour, but let's take one more question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKyle McNealy: Thanks very much for squeezing it in. This one is macro related as well, but just pretty quick. It seems like some of the long macros implied in your 2023 guidance, but I don't think you talked specifically about whether you're seeing anything specifically slowing. It sounded generally positive for you guys, even though there's a bit of a slowdown implied in the guidance. Microsoft and F5 talked about a divergence between new business and new applications, seeing some growth versus renewal business, capacity expansions, cross-selling and things like that. Are you seeing a similar thing in terms of new applications slowing a bit and some of the kind of recurring and cross-selling capacity expansion is holding up? How much of either of those is driving your lower end of mid-single-digit growth guidance for 2023 and kind of break it down, if you can. Thanks.\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Look, I think that first and I'll address your point of new application versus existing pretty directly. The point about the lower end of the mid-single digit is largely from the fact that Infrastructure segment will be a headwind going into 2023, whereas it was a tailwind in 2022. I wouldn't read anything more than that into our low end as opposed to the middle of the range. Now, for us, I don't really see that. I see that our clients do want to do new development. Now, from our perspective, if somebody is doing an expanded sales force deployment, I call that a new application. If somebody is doing a new application on Azure or if they are moving, well, they never really directly move. They always talk about refactoring, putting in new function, integrating with other applications they might have in their shop, or that they buy a SaaS properties, we consider all that new development. And so, for us, our consulting teams are largely doing that new development for our clients. And in that process, they tend to use OpenShift from Red Hat, it tends to use Red Hat Linux, they tend to use our AI automation. Our AI automation then surrounds all those things to make them much more resilient, much more robust, much more secure, and those are the capabilities we bring. So we are not really seeing that divergence, I will tell you straightforwardly, but there is likely a focus that in that new application, is it helping automate things more? Is it helping make things I call it straight through as opposed to with a lot of manual intervention. That is probably a bigger focus. Maybe we don't see it because we kind of call that play in late 2021, because we kind of saw those things coming and becoming more important. And we decided to invest in them, both in technology and in consulting. Patricia, with that being the last question, let me now make a couple of very quick comments to wrap up the call. 2022 was an important year for us. As Jim said, it was the first full year of the new IBM. The results we delivered reinforce our confidence in our strategy and our model. While there is always more to do, we are pleased with our position as we enter 2023, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue as you roll through the year.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Arvind. Sheila, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the fourth quarter. We delivered $16.7 billion in revenue, $3.8 billion of operating pre-tax income and operating earnings per share of $3.60. In our seasonally strongest quarter, we generated $5.2 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up over 6% at constant currency. While the dollar weakened a bit from 90 days ago, it still impacted our reported revenue by over $1 billion and 6.3 points of growth. As always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. And I'll remind you that we wrapped on the separation of Kyndryl at the beginning of November. The one-month contribution to our fourth quarter revenue growth was offset by the impact of our divested health business. Revenue growth this quarter was again broad-based. Software revenue was up 8% and consulting up 9%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 7%. Within each of these segments, our growth was pervasive. We also had good growth across our geographies, with mid single-digit growth are better in Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific. And for the year, we gained share overall. We had strong transactional growth in software and hardware to close the year. At the same time, our recurring revenue, which provides a solid base of revenue and profit also grew, led by software. I'll remind you that on an annual basis, about half of our revenue is recurring. Over the last year, we've seen the results of a more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Our approach to hybrid cloud is platform-centric. As we land a platform, we get a multiplier effect across software, consulting and infrastructure. For the year, our hybrid cloud revenue was over $22 billion, up 17% from 2021. Looking at our profit metrics for the quarter, we expanded operating pre-tax margin by 170 basis points. This reflects a strong portfolio mix and improving software and consulting margins. These same dynamics drove a 60 basis point increase in operating gross margin. Our expense was down year-to-year driven by currency dynamics. Within our base expense, the work we're doing to digitally transform our operations provides flexibility to continue to invest in innovation and in talent. Our operating tax rate was 14% which is flat versus last year. And our operating earnings per share of $3.60 was up over 7%. Turning to free cash flow. We generated $5.2 billion in the quarter and $9.3 billion for the year. Our full year free cash flow is up $2.8 billion from 2021. As we talked about all year, we have a few drivers of our free cash flow growth. First, I'll remind you, 2021's cash flow results included Kyndryl related activity including the impact of spin charges and CapEx; second, we had working capital improvements driven by efficiencies in our collections and mainframe cycle dynamics. Despite strong collections, the combination of revenue performance above our model and the timing of the transactions in the quarter led to higher-than-expected working capital at the end of the year. This impacted our free cash flow performance versus expectations. Our year-to-year free cash flow growth also includes a modest tailwind from cash tax payments and lower payments for structural actions, partially offset by increased CapEx investment for today's IBM. In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested $2.3 billion to acquire eight companies across software and consulting, mitigated by over $1 billion in proceeds from divested businesses, and we returned nearly $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we ended the year in a strong liquidity position with cash of $8.8 billion, this is up over $1 billion year-to-year and our debt balance is down nearly $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and I say the same for our retirement-related plans. At year-end, our worldwide tax qualified plans are funded at 114%, with the US at 125%. Both are up year-to-year. You'll recall, back in September, we took another step to reduce the risk profile of our plans. We transferred a portion of our U.S. qualified defined benefit plan obligations to insurers, without changing the benefits payable to plan participants. This resulted in a significant non-cash charge in our GAAP results in the third quarter, and we'll see a benefit in our non-operating charges going forward. You can see the benefit of this and other pension assumptions to the 2023 retirement-related costs in our supplemental charts. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 8%, fueled by growth in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing. We concluded the year with seasonally strong transactional performance as well as a solid and growing recurring revenue base in software. In hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 10%, with pervasive growth across our business areas: Red Hat, automation, data and AI and security. Our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI is resonating with clients. As a proof point, OpenShift, our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform now has $1 billion in annual recurring revenue, and we modernize and optimize our software capabilities, including through cloud packs across automation, data and AI and security for that platform. Red Hat revenue grew 15% in the quarter, led by strength in OpenShift and Ansible, both growing double digits and gaining market share. Automation revenue was up 9%. Growth was led by business automation, application servers and integration as clients look to automate business workflows and improve applications. Data and AI revenue grew 8% with enterprise needs to organize, store and manage their data. This performance reflects demand in areas including data management, data fabric and asset and supply chain management. Security delivered 10% revenue growth. We're helping clients detect, prevent and respond to security incidents, which led to strength across threat management, data security and identity. Across these businesses, the annual recurring revenue or ARR for hybrid platform and solutions is $13.3 billion. And for all of software, hybrid cloud revenue is now more than $9.3 billion over the last year, up 16%. In transaction processing, revenue was up 3%. Demand for this mission-critical software has followed increases in Z Systems installed base capacity over the last couple of product cycles and strong renewal rates continued this quarter. Both are evidence of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment. Moving to software profit. Our pre-tax margin was up 2 points this quarter, contributing to a full year margin of nearly 25%. Consulting revenue grew 9%. Clients are leveraging IBM's hybrid cloud leadership and deep industry expertise to navigate the complexity of their digital transformation journeys. Revenue growth was broad-based across all business lines and geographies. And I'll remind you that this is on top of the 16% growth consulting delivered in the fourth quarter of 2021. Strong demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 17%. With this, fourth quarter had the best quarterly book-to-bill of the year, and we sequentially improved our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio to 1.1. Clients are partnering with IBM Consulting as they decide what applications to modernize and how to migrate those applications across hybrid, multi-cloud environments. Over the last 12 months, consulting delivered $9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue, which is up 23%. This quarter, our Red Hat practice was again a meaningful contributor to this growth. Revenue from strategic partnerships also grew at a strong double-digit rate. We continue to see momentum in this space. In aggregate, our strategic partnership bookings were up over 50% with Azure and AWS more than doubling. Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 7%. Growth in business transformation was once again driven by data and client experience transformation along with supply chain and finance optimization. Our partnerships with key ISV partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe enable IBM Consulting to transform critical workloads at scale. In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 10%. Growth was led by cloud application development practices. Red Hat engagements along with our strategic hyperscaler partnerships contributed to the growth. Application operations revenue grew 12%. We help clients to optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environment. Our incumbency and understanding of clients' applications are key differentiators.  Moving to consulting profit. Our pre-tax margin was 11% for the quarter and nearly 9% for the year. The fourth quarter margin is up nearly 2 points year-to-year and over 1 point sequentially. We are starting to see the benefit from pricing actions and productivity and our acquisitions have become more accretive. Turning to Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 7% driven by hybrid infrastructure, which was up 11%. Within hybrid infrastructure, Z systems revenue grew 21% this quarter. Among the new z16 capabilities, clients are leveraging cyber resiliency to comply with business regulations and proactively avoid outages in their operation and the new on-chip AI accelerator, for example, has been helping mitigate risk and detect fraud in credit card application processes. Our distributed infrastructure revenue was up 5%. This performance was fueled by strength in power following the extension of Power 10 innovation throughout the product line. Infrastructure support performance was flat including the impact from client adoption of new hardware with the latest z16 product cycle. Moving to infrastructure profit. Pre-tax margin was down less than 1 point in the quarter. And for the full year, our pretax margin was nearly 15%. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. At our investor briefing 15 months ago, we laid out our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and our priorities of revenue growth and free cash flow generation. Since then, we've been focused on our portfolio, our go-to-market model, our ecosystem and our capital allocation to execute that strategy and create value through focus. We now just completed the first year as today's IBM. Our 2022 revenue was up nearly 12%, including nearly 4 points of incremental Kyndryl contribution that's above our model of mid-single-digit growth. Over 70% of our revenue was in our growth vectors of software and consulting and about half of our revenue is recurring. With this high-value mix and contribution from the incremental Kyndryl revenue, we expanded our full year operating pre-tax margin by 2.5 points. And our free cash flow was $9.3 billion, up $2.8 billion from the prior year. We invested organically and inorganically and return significant value to shareholders through dividends. Now there were some external factors that we faced this past year that impacted our profit and cash. We exited a profitable business in Russia. We are dealing with a much stronger dollar, and we are operating in a highly inflationary environment, which put pressure on our margins, especially in consulting. Putting it all together, we are pleased with the fundamentals of our business and the progress we have made in executing our strategy. Our 2022 performance demonstrates that we now have a higher growth, higher value company with higher return on invested capital and a strong and growing free cash flow. For 2023, we again expect solid growth in our two most important measures of success; revenue and free cash flow. Arvind talked about the important role technology plays in this environment and how our solutions are closely aligned to the needs of our clients. With this, we expect constant currency revenue growth for the year to be in line with our mid-single-digit model. As we enter this year, I think it's prudent to expect the low-end of the mid single-digit model. And for free cash flow, we'd expect to generate about $10.5 billion in 2023, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Let me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pre-tax profit performance by segment. In software, with continued momentum in our recurring revenue stream in both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing, we expect revenue growth in line with software's mid single-digit model. This revenue growth generates operating leverage, and we'd expect software pre-tax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. Consulting's model is to deliver high single-digit revenue. We're coming off a strong year with revenue growth of 15% as we help clients with their digital transformations. This momentum and strong book-to-bill ratio support consulting revenue growth at the high-end of its model despite the tough compare. We expect to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least 1 point as we continue to realize more of the price increases and improved utilization. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're entering the year three quarters into the z16 cycle, and will also ramp on Power 10. As a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue below its model and pre-tax margin in the low-teens. For perspective, infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point. That's in line with our model and our tax rate should be in the mid- to high-teens range. Let me comment on a few items within our expectations. First, as I said, currency was a significant headwind in 2022, impacting revenue by $3.5 billion. With the movement of spot rates over the last 90 days, currency translation would be fairly neutral to revenue in 2023 with a headwind in the first half, flipping to a tailwind in the second. But I'll remind you that we had over $650 million of hedging gains in 2022, which will not repeat in 2023, resulting in an impact to our profit and cash on a year-to-year basis. Second, as you know, we've taken a number of significant portfolio actions over the last couple of years, which has resulted in some stranded cost in our business. We expect to address these remaining stranded costs early in the year and anticipate a charge of about $300 million in the first quarter. We would start to see benefits in the second half and pay back by the end of the year. And then third, we regularly review the useful lives of our assets. Due to advances in technology, we are making an accounting change to extend the useful life of our server and networking equipment effective the 1st of January. Based on our year-end asset base, we expect this change to benefit 2023 pre-tax profit by over $200 million, primarily in our Infrastructure segment. Given this is a change to the depreciation, there's no benefit to cash. Looking at the first quarter, our constant currency revenue growth should be fairly consistent with the full year. Reported growth will also include about a three-point currency headwind at current spot rates. With operating leverage, we'd expect operating pre-tax margin to expand 50 to 100 basis points in the first quarter. And that's before the charge I just mentioned for the remaining stranded costs. Given the timing of currency and stranded cost dynamics, we'd expect about one-third of our net income in the first half and about two-thirds in the second half. To sum it all up, we have made a lot of progress this past year. While there's always more work to do, we're confident in the fundamentals of our business, and how we're positioned as we enter the New Year. Patricia, let's go to the Q&A. Thanks, Amit. This is Jim. I appreciate the question. So let's start there. We saw a solid free cash flow generation in 2022, up $2.8 billion year-over-year. Now as you remember, we entered 2022. We talked about a very strong free cash flow generation engine. And we put in place a guidance for 2022 well in excess of our model of $750 million year-to-year. First, as we were very transparent, we were going to get at least about half of that out of the Kyndryl related spin dynamics. That's the charges and CapEx. And we were going to get a little bit more than half of that out of our base operations overall. And I think when you look at 2022, what happened we got impacted by two external factors. Number one, the unfortunate humanitarian crisis with the war in Russia and Ukraine, and we exited that business, the right decision. Second is unprecedented US dollar appreciation. I think last time I looked, the rate, the breadth, the magnitude of the change is the most we've seen in multiple decades. We got hit with that. But we're able to overcome some of that with the fundamental underpinnings of our business overall and still delivered almost $3 billion of free cash flow year-over-year. By the way, Russian currency by themselves is over $600 million of profit and cash we had to absorb. So now to your question about 2023, we guided, as you heard in the prepared remarks, a $10.5 billion, that's up $1.2 billion year-over-year, and again, above our $750 million year-to-year. The underpinnings of that, though, are going to be very different in 2023. Given the improving business fundamentals of our now sustainable revenue growth with a high value mix contribution, we see then continued operating leverage. So our cash PTI is going to deliver a substantial amount of that free cash flow generation year-over-year. We're still going to get working capital efficiency. So our realization will definitely be up over 100%. But that's really given the volume dynamics of what happened in the fourth quarter with a very strong and accelerated growth profile as we went through fourth quarter, we finished extremely strong on our transactional business in the month of December. So that now creates an opportunity for free cash flow generation in 2023 and that's in our guidance. And then there are some other puts and takes. Yes, we'll get modest structural actions tailwind, but they're going to be offset by a cash tax headwind for the year. So that kind of plays out 2022 and 2023 now. How does that relate to a mid-term model? First of all, we're one year into that mid-term model. And as I talked about, the dynamics in dealing with the decision to exit our Russia business and the significant US dollar appreciation, I quantified it for you over a $600 million impact on profit and cash. But as you all know quite well, that's not a one-time impact, that will continue over a multi-period and it definitely puts pressure on our mid-term model to the tune cumulatively about over $2.5 billion. So, we are entirely focused on how we execute this company on a sustainable revenue growth profile and generating that $10.5 billion of free cash flow. So it enables us, with the right ample financial flexibility, to continue to invest in our business and return value to our shareholders overall. Yes. Just to put some numbers around this, Toni, you're exactly right. We entered the year. We talked about a business profile, higher revenue growth company, higher operating margins, strong free cash flow yield. And we had guided at mid single-digit revenue growth, and we guided that four points of operating margin improvement. The two points of external that both Arvind and I have both talked about Russia and currency. By the way, that was about 0.5 point because currency member, as we've talked about many times throughout these calls, not only the rate breadth and velocity and change in magnitude that we haven't seen in about two to three decades, but it impacts human capital-based consulting business very differently than a product technology-based business. As we talk about human capital is all pretty much a natural hedge because your cost is basically matched with your revenue outside of global delivery. But in a product-based business, our costs like the industry is predominantly US dollar source, and that's why you've seen pressure on the gross profit margin line and the pre-tax profit margin line around our technology base of business. Now underlying that though, I think you're seeing a fundamental improvement in our margins as we go forward. So about 50 basis points of currency. The remaining 100 basis points was consulting. And we talked about that. That's been a rate and pace discussion. You dial back 15, 18 months ago, we called a very accelerated demand environment of our clients shifting to digital transformation and journey to cloud. And starting in the second half of 2021, we made the bet to make investments around skill capability ecosystems, and we opened up the aperture to build extended capabilities inorganically. And we knew as we went through 2022 that we then we're operating in a highly inflationary environment. And then it became a rate and pace discussion on how quick can you get price margin and optimization and realize through your backlog. And I think we've acknowledged that we were pretty slow throughout the year. Now with that said, we finished the year about nine points of margin in consulting. We had nice improvement. We exited fourth quarter at 11-point PTI model that was up almost 200 basis points year-over-year, our first half to second half, we saw an acceleration of three points of margin from about a seven-point operating PTI model to well over 10 points of an operating PTI model. And most importantly, the green shoots are starting to play out in the fourth quarter. Our utilization of effective capacity, one of the three levers we talked about all year, up three points in the fourth quarter. Our price margins, third consecutive quarter are up year-to-year, and you're seeing that play out in that operating profit performance. And finally, acquisitions. Now, we're on a steady state and our acquisitions are back to accretion. So, we see nice green shoots that lead to our guidance in 2023 at the high end of our high single-digit model in consulting on revenue coming off of a very strong 15% growth in 2022 and guiding another one point plus in operating margins going forward. Thanks, Eric, for the question. I'll take this. When we entered the fourth quarter, we had a pretty solid pipeline. And we talked about reaffirmed mid-teens growth for consulting for the year, which as you know, is well above our model. But again, as I talked about on the previous question, we had made the investments in bringing in skill capability, expanding ecosystem, strategic partnerships and acquisitions. But we saw that pipeline entering the quarter we saw a very solid and pretty disciplined sales closure rate as we move through the year. Now, how did the year end that positions us for 2023 and let me just put some stats to really bring it home. Number one, ecosystem velocity, we saw continue to increase throughout the year of our strategic partnerships. I think we said in the prepared remarks, strategic partnerships, one grew revenue 25% in 2022 and was about 40% of our consulting base of business. That is up about 50% year-over-year. We have saw \u2013 seen extensive acceleration. And by the way, in the fourth quarter, our signings growth which delivered a 1.3 book-to-bill, our hyperscaler partnerships with Azure and with AWS, our signings were 2x. And our ISV portfolio with the likes of SAP, Salesforce, Adobe, we were up over 50% in signings. So our book of business and the partnerships we have tremendous strength that's fueling our backlog, point number one. Point number two, Red Hat. We continue to see acceleration of consulting being the tip of the spear that's really driving the scale and adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. And oh, by the way, is also dragging IBM technology and software. Since inception, a little over three years, we signed $7.4 billion of business in Red Hat, tremendous strength and that, again, fuels our backlog for 2023. And then you look at full year, we grew both large transformational deals, and we grew small deals double digit, both sides. So it's pervasive across the board. So when we look at our backlog, we look at all of our indicators of our business on the realization of that model. We look on the acquisition portfolio and how it's scaling. We feel pretty confident about the high end of our high single-digit model in 2023. Oh, by the way, to Toni's question, at operating margins being accretive. Yes. I would just build on that, Arvind. I mean, Software book of business today, it's an integral part of our hybrid cloud platform thesis. It is the foundation. We eclipsed $25 billion for the first time ever here in 2022. So over 40% of IBM's revenue and two-thirds of our EBITDA. So when you look at it, we are a hybrid cloud AI platform-centric company overall and software is right at that course. So why that recurring revenue stream and the improvements we've been seeing throughout 2022. And as Arvind answered earlier, getting that back to a growing contribution, not only helps the competitiveness and market share of our top line, but I think all of you understand the marginal dollar of that book of business is in the 90-plus percent range, as we move forward. So David, I think you also asked a question about clarification. Free cash flow growth, $10.5 billion about, up $1.2 billion year-to-year, above our model of $7.50 billion. That will be driven based on the fundamental improvements of our underlying revenue growth and operating leverage and cash PTI, but there will also be, yes, a working capital efficiency contribution to our cash generation next year, really just the volume dynamics of what played out in the fourth quarter. We'll get that back."

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We delivered strong revenue growth in our business. The growth was broad-based across our software, consulting, and infrastructure segments as well as across geographies. Our clients recognize that technology continues to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Over the last several quarters, it has become clear that technology is playing a significant role in boosting productivity in the face of inflation, demographic shifts, supply chain challenges and sustainability requirements. We entered 2022, a more focused company and took steps to reinforce our position. We strengthened our consulting expertise and expanded strategic partnerships. To bolster our software portfolio, we invested in hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. We also delivered significant innovations in infrastructure with our z16 and Power platforms. All of this was brought to market with a more technical and experiential sales approach. Looking back on the year, we are pleased with the progress we made. We delivered revenue growth above our mid-single-digit model and we delivered solid free cash flow. But I'll acknowledge there is more to do. This year, we'll unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships, and put more investment in specific growth markets. For 2023, we see revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range and about $10.5 billion of free cash flow. This keeps us on a path of sustainable growth. I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy. Our perspective is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the two most transformative technologies for business today. These technologies work together to drive business outcomes. Hybrid cloud is where the world is going. Containers are the preferred destination for applications. Hybrid cloud offers more value than relying on a singular public cloud. It enables organizations to drive business value across multiple clouds, on-premise or at the edge. This includes scale, security, ease of use, flexibility of deployment, seamless experiences and faster innovation cycles. Our platform, built on Red Hat, is the leading container platform, allowing clients to harness the power of open source software innovations. IBM software and infrastructure technologies have been optimized for this platform. Our consultants and others leverage their extensive technical and business expertise to accelerate clients' digital transformation journeys. Clients realizing real value from working with IBM's hybrid cloud platform approach. For example, we worked with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, CIBC, to adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Using Red Hat technology, CIBC manages and skills its infrastructure with greater speed and flexibility. They can now develop applications in a private cloud and quickly deploy them to a public cloud. They deliver hundreds of new applications and reduced -- provisioning time by 95% and deployment time by 50%. We are helping Delta Airlines leverage hybrid cloud to modernize options, automate operations and integrate security. IBM Consulting deployed Red Hat on Amazon Web Services and IBM Cloud Packs to provide a consistent platform. Delta now has more levers that can use to boost developer productivity, reduce time to market and improve employee satisfaction. CIBC and Delta are both great examples of the value hybrid cloud can provide. Let's now talk about artificial intelligence, or AI. AI is projected to contribute $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030, including a massive boost in productivity by infusing AI into every enterprise process. We have been co-creating with many clients to deploy AI at scale. We automated the drive-through experience for quick-serve restaurants. We accelerated the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines by automating the processes that assist millions of customers with inquiries and appointments. By applying AI and automation we have helped security analysts to use the time to respond to threats from hours or days, to minutes. Recently, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office partnered with IBM to leverage a host of AI capabilities that make it easier for people to glean insights from their vast database of patents. The BBC is now using our AIOps software to automate the management of its IT infrastructure. For businesses, deploying AI can be challenging because it takes time to train each model. But by using large language models, companies can now create multiple models using the same data set. This means businesses can deploy AI with a fraction of the time and resources. That is why we are investing in large language, our foundation models for our clients and have infused these capabilities across our AI portfolio. Our partner ecosystem plays a critical role in the execution of our strategy. In the fourth quarter, we made a series of new IBM software offerings available as-a-Service in the AWS marketplace. Likewise, Red Hat continued the expansion of its offerings in hyperscaler marketplaces, making Ansible Automation Platform available on both Azure and AWS. Adobe and Salesforce are also leveraging open source innovation based on Red Hat technologies in their offerings. Business with our strategic partners continues to grow with SAP, Microsoft and AWS, all over $1 billion in revenue for the year. We've had great success with our strategic partners and as we enter the New Year, we are expanding and better enabling our broader ecosystem. Recently launched Partner Plus, a new simplified program that increases our reach and scale through new and existing IBM partners. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. In the fourth quarter, we introduced Red Hat Device Edge, a lightweight solution to flexibly deploy traditional or containerized workloads on small devices such as robots, IoT gateways, point-of-sale and public transport. We also formed a collaboration with the Japanese consortium, Rapidus to leverage the depth of our intellectual property on advanced semiconductors. We unveiled Osprey, a 433-qubit quantum processor, that brings us closer to delivering our goal of building a 1,000 qubit system later this year. At the same time, we continue to acquire companies to complement our organic innovation. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Octo, which improves our footprint in the US federal market. This caps the year with eight acquisitions across software and consulting. As sustainability becomes more of a priority, companies need digital technologies to analyze data, creating a baseline and improve the way they operate. Our software has helped IBM reduce its own carbon footprint. Across IBM's global real estate presence, we were able to reduce carbon emissions by over 61% when compared to 2010. Using IBM sustainability software, we have simplified and automated our sustainability reporting processes and reduced reporting costs by 30%. Let me wrap by saying I'm pleased with the progress we have made with our portfolio, our go-to-market and our ecosystem. I'm confident in our ability to leverage hybrid cloud and AI to help clients turn business challenges into opportunities. Our strategy continues to strongly resonate with clients and partners, and this gives us a solid foundation to build upon in this year. While there is more to be done, we enter the New Year as a more capable and nimble company, well-equipped to meet our clients' needs. I will now turn it over to Jim who will give you more detailed information on our performance and expectations. Yeah. Thanks Wamsi, for the question. So, I'll address your transaction processing question first and then all of software right after that. So some of you have heard me talk about that transaction processing would be a mid-single-digit decliner in the past. And that's effectively, Wamsi, is what you asked, what's going to be different. As we look at our business there and we look both at the underlying MIPS growth, as well as the criticality of that software, as well as our ability to have some very modest pricing uplift, we would now look at that business as being a slight increaser as opposed to a modest decliner. So, I think, if you are looking at that one, Wamsi, low single-digit increases for transaction processing is what we think is appropriate for the short to medium-term model looking forward. Now, that does help in overall software. So first, let's look at software and decompose it. Software, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, is almost 80% recurring revenue. We see that recurring revenue increasing consistent with our model of the mid-single digits, based on both the consumption, the usage, as well as what we have seen through '22 in people renewing that base of software business. Then, I will acknowledge to you that '22 was a great ELA year, '23 will be not as good as '22. But with the transactional piece of the business being less than 20%, that has a much smaller impact on the overall growth rate. As you put all that together, we see the mid-single digits as being appropriate for the software business. Yes. Toni, thanks. So, you're completely accurate that these numbers are slightly below our expectations from the beginning of the year. I will ask Jim to comment and give you a lot more color on it. But let me first comment on your statement of, we have a double mandate of revenue growth and free cash flow growth, but I want to also be clear, revenue growth has -- which manifests itself in client satisfaction, higher NPS from our clients, better consumption of both software and consulting from our clients, which allows them to consume more and more over time is what we are focused on. And it's an and we have to deliver the free cash flow growth. Jim mentioned in a response to the first question that we were not expecting the business and Russia to get shut down, that impacted it a little bit. We were not expecting the currency headwinds to be as severe as it turned out to be. That's certainly impacted. And I'll acknowledge, an inflation as in wage inflation showed up and impacted our margins in consulting a lot more than we were expecting. Now an answer could have been to not hire people and to not give that but that would have resulted then in lower capacity at the end of this year, which would not have allowed us the confidence into the growth, both in consulting and in software that we are now committing for 2023. So as we balance those, it becomes a business decision to say, we are going to keep going on increasing capacity, which results in healthier revenue and it will result in improving margins, but that flows through into 2023 as opposed to giving it all to us in 2022. So Toni, that's kind of how we think about balancing the investments in the business versus a quarterly result. And I'll ask Jim to comment a bit more on some of the specifics of what you were asking. Thanks Shannon. So, first, let me acknowledge AI has become a big topic of conversation this year. I was in Davos last week, and it probably came up at almost every single discussion around technology, what's happening with AI as well as what's happening with OpenAI. If I think about it over the last decade, I think there were three moments you can talk about, and then I'll begin to translate those into a business impact. One, when IBM won Jeopardy! with Watson, I think it was a big moment, and AI came on to everyone's roadmap. Second, when deep mind from Google or Alphabet started winning competitions around, for example, GO, and that became another big moment along with the protein folding that they did and now with OpenAI and ChatGPT. But if I step back just a moment, all of this latest version is based on what is called large language models as the underlying science. Universities do it, Google does it, IBM does it as does OpenAI. To just get to why it's so exciting. For example, for us, it allows us to do 13 language models when we are looking at understanding different natural languages in the same cost as originally one. That is what is so exciting about these technologies because if you can get an order of magnitude improvement in cost and speed and the resource consumed, both in terms of hardware and people, that is incredibly exciting. Now, let me translate this into how do we monetize this. So, our monetization of AI is very much focused on that $16 trillion of productivity that I've talked about that we're going to get over the decade. The vast majority of that comes from enterprise automation, and when I say enterprise, I include governments into it. Some examples, if you can automate the drive-through and order taking for quick-serve restaurants, that's an example of what can happen. If we can get deflection rates of 40%, 50%, 60% at everyone's call centers, that's a massive operational efficiency for all of our clients. If we can help retirees get their pensions through interacting with a Watson-powered AI chatbot that is an enterprise use case where all of these technologies come into play. By the way, all my three examples are real clients where we are resulting in anywhere from hundreds to thousands of people, efficiency for each of these clients. So that's how we get it. If I look inside IBM, how we do promotions, how we do people movement, how we begin to improve our code to cash, how we improve our customer service and people ask complicated questions around triage of IT systems going down are all very real examples where we are improving client service and saving money all at the same time. Yeah. Thanks, Lisa, for the question. Look, if I think about our overall client base, we were first really pleased that there wasn't much of a difference by geography. As I go through it, Japan, India, Australia, the Middle East, Western Europe, the UK, North America were really pretty strong in demand across. So I think Lisa, if I break it down into the two portions around technology and consulting, what we are seeing is that most of our clients do believe, but even if there are some I call the minor or different headwinds in 2023, they are going to emerge stronger. As they want to emerge stronger, that means they're all deploying technology to help offset wage inflation, cyber issues, supply chain challenges and all the demographic shifts, meaning there's just fewer skilled people to hire. Consequently, we're seeing them double down, and that is why we have focused on certain areas and certain partners, both for consulting and in technology. So they all want to deploy automated ways to get from the front to the back maybe Salesforce and Adobe play a very strong role in that. They all want to leverage cloud technologies that they can scale technology up to better handle client demand. Our partnerships with the hyperscalers play into that. They all want to leverage far more technology than they have before to counteract the wage inflation and other inflationary aspects and what we do with Red Hat plays into that. So I kind of see, Lisa, that all of our clients play into that. Now you've mentioned a wide spectrum from the people you're seeing recently, I think the reason that we are remaining in this optimistic frame of mind, we have no consumer business. I agree that our clients may have a consumer business, but we don't have that directly. And so I think consequently, we might be seeing a little bit different subset of the economy than those who might have a large direct exposure to a consumer business. Yes. Thanks, David. Let me talk a little bit about the product capabilities. And as you said outside Red Hat called focus on automation, data AI and cyber. If I look at those, let's take automation. I'm really pleased with the progress we have made around an area I'll call AIOps. But if you think about, we made a couple of small acquisitions Instana and Turbonomics, we built our own AIOps portfolio. And we're seeing tremendous pickup from that as our clients want to take out labor complexity but also want to optimize their overall IT infrastructure, hardware and software. They also want to have uptime that is now the talk about not just 2 9s and 3 9s, but up to 5 9s. And they also want to worry about how to make sure some go to always on. And so I think our AIOps portfolio there really advantages us, and I believe we're in a unique position because we help our clients in an environment across multiple public clouds and on-premise, and with their private clouds in that space. If I think about data and AI, our focus on data fabric and allowing our clients to leverage the data wherever it is, not always moving it, but allowing them to catalog it, leveraging AI, deep inside our products is another example of where we have a unique capability. And third, if I look at cyber, we focus a lot on threat management. And if we think about how we can leverage the inputs from all kinds of sources in these days, and people are really worried about all of the threats coming, whether from nation states, all from just bad actors, then it allows them to leverage that portfolio better. Consequently, we're going to remain pretty focused on these areas. You should expect both organic and inorganic investment. And David, I can't help us say, we are giving our clients the ability to deploy these capabilities on multiple public clouds as well as on-premise and I believe that does advantage them because it gives them a lot more flexibility and freedom than they might have from some other vendors. Okay. Look, I think that first and I'll address your point of new application versus existing pretty directly. The point about the lower end of the mid-single digit is largely from the fact that Infrastructure segment will be a headwind going into 2023, whereas it was a tailwind in 2022. I wouldn't read anything more than that into our low end as opposed to the middle of the range. Now, for us, I don't really see that. I see that our clients do want to do new development. Now, from our perspective, if somebody is doing an expanded sales force deployment, I call that a new application. If somebody is doing a new application on Azure or if they are moving, well, they never really directly move. They always talk about refactoring, putting in new function, integrating with other applications they might have in their shop, or that they buy a SaaS properties, we consider all that new development. And so, for us, our consulting teams are largely doing that new development for our clients. And in that process, they tend to use OpenShift from Red Hat, it tends to use Red Hat Linux, they tend to use our AI automation. Our AI automation then surrounds all those things to make them much more resilient, much more robust, much more secure, and those are the capabilities we bring. So we are not really seeing that divergence, I will tell you straightforwardly, but there is likely a focus that in that new application, is it helping automate things more? Is it helping make things I call it straight through as opposed to with a lot of manual intervention. That is probably a bigger focus. Maybe we don't see it because we kind of call that play in late 2021, because we kind of saw those things coming and becoming more important. And we decided to invest in them, both in technology and in consulting. Patricia, with that being the last question, let me now make a couple of very quick comments to wrap up the call. 2022 was an important year for us. As Jim said, it was the first full year of the new IBM. The results we delivered reinforce our confidence in our strategy and our model. While there is always more to do, we are pleased with our position as we enter 2023, and I look forward to continuing this dialogue as you roll through the year."

The results we delivered in the third quarter reflect our continued focus on the execution of our strategy with over $14 billion of revenue and strong growth across the portfolio. Technology remains a fundamental source of competitive advantage and we continue to see solid demand for our hybrid cloud and AI solutions, continued double-digit revenue growth in IBM Consulting, capturing client demand for digital transformations. Software revenue performance was also strong with growth across all categories and our infrastructure business had another high growth quarter in both Z systems and Distributed Infrastructure. Our revenue strength was broad based geographically as well. When I talk with clients it\u2019s clear there\u2019s a real opportunity to help businesses leverage technology in today\u2019s environments. Clients are dealing with everything from inflation to demographic shifts from supply chain bottlenecks to sustainability efforts. By deploying powerful hybrid cloud and AI technologies, IBM is helping businesses seize new opportunities, overcome today\u2019s challenges and emerge stronger. We too are building a stronger company that is closely aligned to the needs of our clients. In line with our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we have continued to focus our portfolio, invest in our offerings, technical talent and ecosystem, and streamline our go-to-market model. With strong performance through the first three quarters, we are taking up our revenue expectations for the year and now expect 2022 revenue above our mid single digit model. Let me now turn to the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy. Our point of view is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the two most transformational enterprise technologies of our time. Hybrid cloud is already becoming the dominant architecture for enterprise. According to a recent survey by The Harris Poll, 77% of businesses surveyed said they have adopted hybrid cloud for their organizations with data located across multiple clouds on-premise or at the edge. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can drive value across these different environments. Our platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume software driven by open source innovation. IBM software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and security capabilities. Our consultants offer deep business expertise and co-create with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys and our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of a hybrid cloud environment. Our platform centric strategy continues to have good momentum adding a couple of hundred hybrid cloud platform clients in the third quarter. We see more and more clients consuming across our portfolio of software, consulting and infrastructure capabilities. This quarter clients such as Bank of America, Bharti Airtel and Samsung Electronics have chosen IBM to realize the full potential of a hybrid cloud computing model.  Let me now say a few words about our AI capabilities. As demographic shifts continue to add pressure to modern economies coupled with wage inflation, companies are eager to deploy AI and automation capabilities at scale to boost their levels of productivity. That is what IBM is helping companies bring to bear. In the context of our enterprise, we are seeing four main use cases emerge: AI to interact and converse. AI to automate IT processes, AI to extract knowledge and insights, and finally, AI to automate business workflows such as HR, supply chains and financial reporting. We are working to bring these capabilities to clients across all industries. For instance, this quarter, IBM Consulting partnered with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to automate business workflows related to the delivery of pension benefits. This helps free up valuable time of VA staffs and speed up the processing of claims made by the veterans most in need. Our partner ecosystem is a crucial element of our strategy. Each quarter we continue to expand the work we do with partners to serve our joint clients. For instance, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with VMware to help clients and regulated industries more easily move workloads to the cloud with IBM Consulting now serving as a GSI partner for VMware. We announced that Red Hat and Dell are launching a set of containerized solutions aimed at simplifying the management of multi-cloud environments on-premise. Gartner predicts that by 2026 90% of organizations will use containers. These actions represent another step in our efforts to seize this opportunity through ecosystem relationships and our technology offerings. We are actively working to introduce new innovation and shape the technologies of the future. Most recently, we unveiled the next generation of our LinuxONE server, a Linux and Kubernetes-based platform designed to support thousands of workloads within the footprint of a single system. As an example, Citibank is hosting MongoDB on IBM LinuxONE, leveraging the platform security, resiliency and elastic capacity, and helping Citi lower its overall carbon footprint. We also continue to make progress in quantum computing. We remain on track towards our goal of building a 1,000-qubit system by 2023. To advance the security of our communication networks, IBM alongside Vodafone, recently joined the GSMA\u2019s Post-Quantum Telco Network Taskforce. This taskforce aims to introduce a framework for the telco industry to adopt new quantum safe approaches. Complementing our organic innovation, we recently acquired Dialexa. This brings our total number of acquisitions this year to seven, adding new capabilities in areas like hybrid cloud services, security, data observability and sustainability. As the world takes on the challenge of sustainability and building a more circular economy, IBM has been building a portfolio of solutions to help companies make progress on this journey. This quarter, we received recognition highlighting our sustainability efforts. The analyst firm, HFS Research and Forbes, both recognized IBM for its capabilities in the area of sustainability, including Envizi and our Environmental Intelligence Suite software. Let me conclude by reminding you that last October and just prior to the separation of Kyndryl, we held our investor briefing laying out priorities for our portfolio and growth. Over the last four quarters, we have driven constant currency revenue growth at or above our mid-single digit model with solid free cash flow. And while there is always more to do, we are pleased with our first year\u2019s progress. As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategy and execution and feel we are well positioned to address today\u2019s client needs. Let me now turn it over to Jim who will provide more details on the quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. I\u2019ll start with the financial highlights. In the third quarter we delivered $14.1 billion in revenue, $2 billion of operating pre-tax income at a margin of nearly 14% and operating earnings per share of $1.81. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated over $4 billion of free cash flow. Revenue was up 15%, which includes about five points of contribution from sales to Kyndryl. While we\u2019ll discuss our results today at constant currency, I\u2019ll mention that with the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, currency translation impacted our reported revenue growth by more than eight points or nearly $1.1 billion. As Arvind said, our revenue growth this quarter was pervasive. Software revenue was up 14% and consulting up 16%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 23%, reflecting solid product cycle dynamics. Software and Infrastructure include about eight and nine points of growth respectively. From the commercial relationship with Kyndryl, more than half of our revenue is recurring and this annuity content, which is driven by software, continues to grow. Performance was also broad-based by geography. Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific revenue were all up double digits and we gained share overall. These revenue results reflect the execution of a more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy based on a platform-centric approach and leveraging a broad ecosystem of partners. Our full stack capabilities across software, consulting and infrastructure delivered 20% growth in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year to over $22 billion. Looking at our profit metrics, operating pre-tax income was up and margin expanded by 180 basis points year-to-year. These profit dynamics reflect our portfolio shift toward higher value led by software. This mix shift is contributing to profit and margin. Our pre-tax profit also includes the contribution from incremental sales to Kyndryl. Like our clients, we are focused on digitally transforming our own operations, applying AI and automation to drive productivity and efficiency in the spend base. This provides flexibility to continue to invest in talent, innovation and our ecosystem in an inflationary environment. 90 days ago we spent some time talking about currency dynamics. I\u2019ll remind you of a few of the key points. A stronger dollar impacts our revenue and gross profit dollars. We execute a hedging program which defers versus eliminates the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense, but with the rate and magnitude of the movements and because we don\u2019t hedge all currencies, we do have a currency impact to our overall profit and cash flow. Wrapping up the discussion on profit dynamics, the currency impacts and a good amount of investments are in gross profit, while the mitigating hedging benefits and operational productivity are reflected primarily in expense. As a result, pre-tax income is a better indicator of our profit performance. Our operating tax rate was about 16%. Compared to last year tax is a significant year-to-year headwind to operating net income and operating EPS growth, which were both down modestly year-to-year. Turning to free cash flow. We generated $4.1 billion in the first three quarters. That\u2019s up over $900 million year-to-year. We\u2019re wrapping on payments related to the Kyndryl separation and the 2020 structural action and driving working capital efficiencies. In terms of uses of cash in the first three quarters, we invested over $1 billion in acquisitions, which was more than offset by proceeds from divested businesses. And we returned nearly $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we issued debt in July to prudently get ahead of our 2023 maturities. Our debt balance is up since June but down nearly $1 billion since December. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with cash of $9.7 billion. This is up over $2 billion from year-end and well in excess of the minimum cash required for our business. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 14%. This includes about eight points of Kyndryl contribution. Both of our revenue categories, hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing through this quarter. This performance reflects our strong and growing recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of our annual software revenue. And Software\u2019s hybrid cloud revenue is now $9.2 billion over the last year, up 20%. In hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 8%, including about 1.5 contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. The growth was broad-based. Red Hat revenue all-in grew 18%. As a leader in open source technologies for the enterprise, Red Hat\u2019s performance was again fueled by market share gains across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible this quarter. With our enterprise incumbency and global scale, we continue to see an increase in large deals as well as strong cross-sell and upsell across Red Hat solutions. Automation revenue grew 3%. This quarter\u2019s performance reflects continued adoption in areas like AIOps and management and integration, while we\u2019re also wrapping a strong acquisition content from last year. We\u2019re bringing innovation to our clients this quarter such as new Instana Observability capabilities for z Systems in a hybrid cloud environment. In data and AI, revenue was up 4%. Let me highlight just a few of the growth areas this quarter. Data management fuels advanced analytics. Data fabric helps clients discover and unlock the value of their data wherever it resides, and information exchange enables the timely and secure flow of complex B2B information. And offerings like Envizi and Environmental Intelligence Suite are resonating with clients as they prioritize sustainability efforts. Security revenue was up 6%, with growth in both data security and threat management. In data security, we\u2019re seeing adoption of Guardium Insights as we continue to deliver new product innovation. Brent management growth was led by Cloud Pak for Security, which helps clients prevent and respond to modern threats across disparate security feeds. Across hybrid platform and solutions, the annual recurring revenue, or ARR is now $13 billion and up 9%. Transaction processing revenue was up 33%, including about 26 points of Kyndryl contribution. The increase in z Systems\u2019 installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and continued strong renewal rates are recognition of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, the transaction processing annuity base is now growing. Looking at software profit, we delivered operating leverage, given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up more than four points over last year. Consulting revenue grew 16%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This strong performance was again broad-based with revenue growing at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Over the last year, our book-to-bill ratio is 1.05. Clients trust IBM\u2019s deep industry expertise and co-creation approach throughout their hybrid cloud and digital transformation journeys. As IBM Consulting designs and enables enterprise hybrid cloud strategies, this business delivered $8.9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year. That\u2019s up 28%. Our Red Hat consulting practice continues to be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth, growing strong double-digits as we add new engagements. Since IBM acquired Red Hat just over three years ago, Consulting has led nearly 1,400 Red Hat engagements with over $6.5 billion in aggregate bookings. Strategic partnerships also contributed to performance, continuing to grow revenue at a double-digit rate. Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 14% as clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive, driven by supply chain, finance, data and client experience transformations. Working with our partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe, we help our clients optimize their operations and improve the way they engage with their customers. In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients\u2019 cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 17%. Once again, growth was led by cloud application development and cloud modernization, including our Red Hat practice, which as I mentioned, grew strong double digits. Application operations revenue grew 17%. IBM helps clients optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of clients\u2019 applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. We leverage AI to help predict problems before they happen and monitor our clients\u2019 different environments with dashboards, enabling action to be taken quickly. Moving to Consulting profit. Our pre-tax margin of about 10% is down year-to-year though up nearly 3 points from the second quarter. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior quarters, Consulting is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. Those dynamics continue to put pressure on the margin profile. However, coming out of the third quarter, we are seeing signs of progress. Our utilization rates are improving as we exited the quarter, our acquisitions are scaling and are on a path to margin accretion, and we\u2019ve seen two quarters of price margin improvement year-over-year that will benefit our margin profile going forward. Moving to our Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 23%. This includes about 9 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid infrastructure revenue grew 41% and Infrastructure Support revenue grew 5%, including about 11 and 7 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively. Looking at hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue nearly doubled, driven by continued adoption of our newest program, z16. This latest program combines embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security. In fact, z16 is the industry\u2019s first quantum-safe system, delivering 25 billion encrypted transactions per day for clients. And as Arvind mentioned, we just introduced our newest LinuxONE server, a highly scalable Linux and Kubernetes-based platform with capabilities to reduce clients\u2019 energy consumption. zSystems remains an enduring platform, playing an important role in a hybrid cloud environment. Distributed Infrastructure revenue was up 21%. Recent innovation across the portfolio enabled broad-based growth within both storage and power. These include the expansion of our Power10 server family earlier this quarter and refreshes to the flash storage solutions throughout this year. Looking at Infrastructure profit, pre-tax margin was up 1 point year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems. Now let me take it back up to the IBM level, and I\u2019ll shift the focus to the full year and the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we\u2019ve continued to invest and make portfolio changes to advance our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, streamline our go-to-market and digitally transform our own operations. Our more focused strategy and portfolio is aligned to client needs. Our revenue performance so far this year demonstrates that. And based on this revenue performance in the first three quarters, as Arvind said, we now see constant currency revenue growth above our mid-single digit model for the year. On top of that, Kyndryl sales add about 3.5 points of growth, primarily in the first three quarters of the year so it\u2019s essentially behind us. U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. And at mid-October spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 7-point headwind to growth for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this impacts profit and free cash flow as well. Looking at free cash flow, our other key metric, we continue to expect to generate about $10 billion for the year. That\u2019s up over $3 billion from last year. A large part of that growth comes from the wrap on the Kyndryl spin-related and structural payments. But we\u2019re also driving working capital efficiency and improving operating profit profile. We expect strong free cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, while we continue to face some external headwinds, including appreciation of the U.S. dollar and exit of our Russia operations. In terms of segment performance for 2022, our view of software has been consistent all year. We continue to expect revenue growth in line with our mid-single digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. And we still see software pre-tax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022. Our IBM Consulting revenue growth has been great, and we\u2019re taking our view up to a mid-teens revenue growth rate for the year. While we\u2019re still operating in a competitive labor environment, we see some encouraging signs in our Consulting margin profile exiting the third quarter. We now expect a Consulting pre-tax margin for the year at the low end of our previous 9% to 10% range, which is up about a point year-to-year. Our Infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. With the strong launch of our z16 earlier this year, Infrastructure revenue performance will be above the model level for the year, and that\u2019s before the 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We expect Infrastructure pre-tax margin in the mid-teens. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, we expect all-in constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit range. At current spot rates, currency translation has increased to an 8 to 9-point headwind to revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That\u2019s up 2 to 3 points from 90 days ago. And then I\u2019ll remind you, in a couple of weeks, we\u2019ll reach the anniversary of our separation of Kyndryl. While the external sales to Kyndryl will remain in our revenue and profit base, we\u2019ve essentially wrapped around the year-to-year contribution to our revenue and profit growth and margin expansion. As we enter the fourth quarter, we look forward to closing out our first calendar year of today\u2019s IBM. As always, we\u2019ll provide a view of 2023 during our fourth quarter earnings report in January. Patricia, now let\u2019s go on to the Q&A.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And second, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. And a really impressive set of numbers, especially from a revenue perspective over here. I guess, Arvind, maybe the question is for you, but there\u2019s a lot of anxiety, I think, among investors in the markets in terms of what the macro situation is and what it means for IT spending going forward. I\u2019d love to get your perspective. What are you hearing from your customers as they think about their IT budgets going forward? How does that look? And are they focusing on different things going forward versus what they\u2019ve done historically from an IBM\u2019s portfolio perspective? Would love to just get a sense on what are you hearing from your customers in aggregate. And then if you could [de-vein] (ph), how does Consulting shake up in a more challenging macro environment, it will be really helpful because the growth rate so far there has been well above the long-term trends. Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Yes. Amit, thank you. Thank you both for the comment and those questions. So let me answer the first part, how do we feel about revenue and demand going forward? First, if you just look at the data going backwards, we see pretty strong demand and we saw double-digit growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Asia and double-digit growth in the Americas. But let me add some color on that as we look forward. And it is with a couple of contextual elements, as you said, on your portfolio. One, we are B2B. We have almost no B2C business, as if almost no, I could say none, but there is the weather business which has got a little bit of element of B2C in it, but it\u2019s tiny. So one is B2B. Second, we\u2019ve done a lot of work over the last three years, and our portfolio is largely in mission-critical areas, areas that are around automation, areas that are about leveraging AI for enterprise productivity. And I think that, that productivity theme is going to play out over actually not just this remaining part of this year but for the next half decade, maybe the full decade. Color. In the Americas, I find a very robust business environment. I find that most enterprises want to invest. They are leveraging technology to scale their business. If I go to Asia, it\u2019s very similar. Very little change from the past, I think going into the next few months, at least. In Europe, I think we shouldn\u2019t put our head in the sand. I think that with the mixture of energy and inflation, you can sense that there is some caution creeping into the conversations, albeit not in the data and not yet in what we are doing as business there. But we\u2019d be foolish not to prepare that there could be a bit of a downturn in Europe only. But let me now put all of that back into context. So you\u2019re saying Americas, Asia, fine. If I get to Europe, Western Europe, ballpark 20% of global GDP. Even if you have a massive impact, 5% to 10%, that\u2019s a 1% to 2% impact on a global level all-in. Technology is typically 3% to 4% ahead of GDP growth. That says there\u2019s still a robust technology environment in there. So I think that\u2019s the sort of the two parts of your question that that we are addressing with that.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Amit. Let\u2019s go to the next question please, Sheila.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. You saw really strong strength in mainframe, which I think was not anticipated 90 days ago. And you also saw a really commensurately strong transaction processing quarter. And I\u2019m wondering whether you saw some strong ELAs in the quarter and maybe you could put that in context in terms of what ELA percentage was in transaction processing? And then separately Arvind, given how strong the cycle is and given your comments about Europe, are you still comfortable about delivering mid single digit growth in 2023? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Toni, this is Jim, I\u2019ll take the first part of the question and Arvind can wrap up about our portfolio and the confidence we have in positioning 2023. When you take a look at our third quarter performance, we\u2019re obviously very pleased with the entire IBM team and what we\u2019ve been able to execute. Continuing to instantiate the value of today\u2019s IBM, which is a very focused hybrid cloud and AI platform company. But let\u2019s dial back 90 days ago. 90 days ago we said all in we were going to be at high single digit revenue growth and we were going to generate about 200 basis points of operating leverage. When you now play that picture of what played out in the third quarter, we are capitalizing on that focused IBM hybrid cloud AI strategy and capitalizing on the accelerated demand from our clients that Arvind talked about up front. And we\u2019re getting revenue dollar contribution that is falling to the bottom line with regards to profit. Our profit\u2019s up 23%. Now with that said, when you look at the profile of the contribution, it was very pervasive and broad based. It was double digit growth across all three of our major segments and double digit growth across all of our markets around the world. And within that software contributed about 3 points of growth ex Red Hat to IBM, consulting delivered about 5 points of growth and infrastructure delivered about 3 points of growth to IBM. And within infrastructure, to your question on mainframe, mainframe basically came in about exactly what we guided to 90 days ago. Remember, we talked about at length the first time in 20 years that we announced a mainframe new innovation in a second quarter and how it was going to change the seasonality of that business. And we had a very strong second quarter, which by the way, we took up revenue guidance in April 4. We talked about 90 days ago how third quarter was going to play out and fourth quarter and we pretty much executed to that. So we feel pretty good about our book of business. So, Arvind turning over to you.\nArvind Krishna: Yes. Thanks Jim. Turning to sort of address the questions, last October we talked about that we are going to be in a mid single digit revenue growth model and that we will be increasing cash flow each year and we have set out a target of $10 billion for this year and $35 billion over the period. There is nothing that we see right now to alter us from what we had said at that time. So I\u2019m going to say that those projections stay in place. As Jim pointed out for 2022, we are saying that we will be above our revenue model and that we believe will play out with the demand that you heard me talk about and then Jim just reinforced. Just a little part, the third quarter is not typically a big ELA quarter, so we should just be \u2013 it\u2019s kind of the normal seasonality. ELAs are really second and fourth much more than first and third. So just to give you a little bit of color and add to what you asked and what Jim said, mainframe hardware has had a strong start. So you would expect that capacity increases. As the capacity increases, you expect that to follow with a tiny lag, sometimes a month, sometimes three months into our transaction processing portfolio. And that\u2019s why you kind of see the strength there.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Toni. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you and congrats on the solid results. Arvind, can you talk about what you\u2019re seeing in the more transactional parts of the business and the context of particularly Q4, which is your largest transactional quarter. Any change in pipeline or conversion rates of that pipeline? Any color there would be helpful. And if I could maybe Jim on the cumulative free cash flow that that you guys just endorsed. How should we think about the step up in cash flow and what would be the key drivers of that outside of the top line growth conversion? What are the other moving pieces that that would help in, in bridging that gap? Thank you so much.\nArvind Krishna: So Wamsi, let me start and then give it to Jim. But I\u2019m also going to reinforce a couple points that Jim made in his prepared remarks. On transactional business, look, I can\u2019t speak to the yield. I can speak to the yield about 10 weeks from now. The yield will come in over the next 10 weeks as opposed to right now. If I look at our pipeline, pipeline indicates the strength that we are seeing. That is what gave us confidence to say that we see revenue coming in above our mid-single digit growth model. We see the pipelines are strong across software and hardware. So the very strong hardware growth in the third quarter that is captured in the infrastructure business, I think that all reflects the demand that is there and across geographies. So not any particular single market being strong. If I look at, then software, I expect that the overall growth will remain strong. Would there be some puts and takes in a couple of small countries as possible. But that is the advantage of having a business that goes across 170 countries where that tends to get absorbed into the overall. Right now, I tell you, good pipelines based on the first nine months of the year, we expect yields to remain good or even better than before. And that\u2019s this piece. And I\u2019ll just make a comment. I would like to say, as Jim pointed out in his prepared remarks that there is an impact on FX that is probably the biggest impact to what we are seeing right now. I certainly, I\u2019ll say hope that we are seeing the end of the dollar strengthening as opposed to another significant change.\nJim Kavanaugh: So Wamsi to that point, as you know, our two key measures of success since Arvind has taken over as Chairman and CEO has been revenue growth profile, converting this portfolio into a sustainable growth orientation and second free cash flow generation. So, we can have the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business. And on that, we said maintaining guidance of about $10 billion. I\u2019ll remind everyone that $10 billion is up over $3 billion year-to-year, first. And it\u2019s up $2 billion from what we published as IBM\u2019s post-separation baseline when you normalize out all the Kyndryl-related activity. So as we spoke about, and Arvind just kind of concluded before he turned over to me, 90 days ago, this takes into account the external headwinds we\u2019ve been talking about this year. One, being the orderly wind down in the exit of our Russia business, which we\u2019ve already taken into account. We\u2019ve been transforming our business and cost structure to take into account losing that high value profit and cash. And second is the continuance strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Now the latter, let\u2019s be honest, it definitely puts pressure and our midterm outlook, but we\u2019re three quarters into that midterm outlook right now. We do have a robust hedging program because we are not immune. I mean, we do business in 170 countries around the world, over a 100 currencies. As we talked about 90 days ago, we do not hedge, a 100% of our currencies. And second, we don\u2019t hedge out more than 12 months. Very important point. So currency is a real impact to profit in cash overall. Now, we hedge to provide us time to take the operational actions that\u2019s price, that\u2019s sourcing strategies, that\u2019s cost structure, and the productivity initiatives that Arvind and I have put within the business. So right now, it\u2019s early in this midterm outlook. We\u2019ve got a headwind on the U.S. dollar until it stabilizes. We are taking the appropriate actions, but let\u2019s be honest, we are all focused on completing 2022. We have a very big fourth quarter in front of us. We\u2019ve got to do roughly $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That\u2019s about 60% of our free cash flow, by the way to put that in perspective, from 2017 to 2020, we did at or better than $6 million of free cash flow. So, we\u2019ve got the right portfolio. We\u2019ve got the right set of operational actions, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Where are we going to get that headwind/tailwind? One, we completed our structural action. So that\u2019s all behind us, and we\u2019ll continue to get the Kyndryl tailwind for the next three months. Second, we expect a very solid working capital quarter with regards to the mainframe cycle and the pure volume dynamics of what\u2019s happening with our accelerated revenue growth profile. And third, we\u2019re going to continue driving a higher revenue profile, get operating cash out of that by driving operating leverage in our business. So that\u2019s what our focus is on completing 2022. And we will talk in January about where we\u2019re at and where the dollar\u2019s at.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Wamsi. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErik Woodring: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats in the really nice quarter here. I wanted to talk about the consulting business. I thought margins held up better than expected in the quarter. So, can you maybe just elaborate on where you found success, repricing contracts where you\u2019ve maybe had some challenges either buy in market or buy geography? Are those pricing increases, keeping pace with dollar strength? Would \u2013 if you could just double click on some of the pricing actions and the success that you\u2019re having and where and why and how? Thanks.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, Erik, thank you very much. I appreciate the question and I appreciate the compliments and I\u2019m sure the entire IBM team has worked extremely hard pleased with this quarter. Well, let\u2019s talk about Consulting. We talked all year long, remember you dialed back to January. We were talking about what we were seeing in the marketplace about an accelerating demand profile driven by our clients\u2019 digital transformations, journeys to cloud, and that we were going to invest upfront and get ahead of that demand profile both in skills, capabilities, ecosystems, acquisitions, why? Because Consulting plays an integral part to our hybrid cloud thesis. It is that tip of the spear. It drives the multiplier effect. It drags the scale and adoption to our hybrid cloud platform, and it pulls our IBM technology. Now, with that said, when you look at it that investment profile coupled with a highly inflationary environment. We\u2019ve seen pressure on our gross margin level throughout the year. But we\u2019ve been making that up on an operating pre-tax margin because Consulting, along with our Infrastructure and Software are yielding the benefits of a much more focused streamlined G&A structure, now post-separation of Kyndryl and a much more effective and aligned streamlined go-to-market model that\u2019s playing out. But when you look at it, 3Q year-to-date, our revenue profiles growing high teens. We\u2019re getting dollar contribution, and we\u2019re seeing 3Q year-to-date at about 30 basis points worth of margin. Now, as I said in the prepared remarks, we talked about three core actions throughout the year, acquisitions, utilization, price. And around those we saw green shoots exiting third quarter. Our acquisitions right now, we\u2019re on a steady state where they\u2019re going to be margin accretive in the fourth quarter. Second, we exited the quarter in a pretty challenging seasonal quarter of a third quarter with higher utilizations. That\u2019s a great sign. And third, for the second quarter a row, we got price optimization in price margins that are up. That has led to our sequential improvement in margins from 2Q to 3Q by three points. And by the way, we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. Margins up sequentially and year-to-year. And that price optimization really as you would expect, always translates back then into the value proposition of your offerings where we have value in application modernization, Red Hat, our hyperscaler and strategic partnerships. We\u2019re seeing a nice margin accretion that\u2019s playing out and that\u2019s going to fuel the fourth quarter here and first half of 2023.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Erik. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much for taking my question. I\u2019m curious, just from an acquisition perspective, you talked about the small acquisitions you\u2019ve made during the year. How are you thinking about maybe a larger acquisition? It\u2019s been a while since obviously, you did Red Hat. And almost more importantly, I\u2019m wondering as you think about your capital allocation, and I know you\u2019ve committed to what you \u2013 the 10 billion for this year, but how do you, how does the higher interest rate environment playing to how you\u2019re thinking about, what you might do and how you expect your balance sheet to look on a longer-term basis? Thank you,\nArvind Krishna: Shannon, let me start by this thing. First, let me explain our rationale and our principles for acquisitions because it\u2019s important to understand that it\u2019s not so much size. Number one, they\u2019ve got to fit our strategy. Our strategy being hybrid cloud and AI. And in Consulting, those which add to our ecosystem growth and our talent. So that limits the universe of what we would look at. Two, especially if it\u2019s going to be larger, it\u2019s got to be accretive. Whether we talk about at the end of the first year or definitely in the second year, it\u2019s got to be accretive to cash flow. Three, there\u2019s got to be synergy with IBM. Like Jim mentioned about the $6 billion in inception to date signings and the 1,400 projects that consulting did with Red Hat, that synergy, meaning that we would not have gotten that revenue and that book of business if we had not done that acquisition. So then if I say that those are criteria, those would be criteria that would open up if there is something that is larger with the correct valuation and the correct economic returns for the company. Now, to your point on interest rates. Certainly, interest rates have an impact, but we\u2019d also like to say there are multiple vehicles on how to raise cash, because the overall fin flex and we had talked about $20 billion of fin flex over the period, but there are other vehicles for also raising cash when we are an attractive target for the acquisition to come into. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, no, I would just add to the last point on the interest rate environment. Shannon, as you saw during this year, we\u2019ve been prudent. I think in hindsight now, it\u2019s always better to be lucky and opportunistic because we\u2019ve went out to the market and basically have pre-funded all of our requirements for the most part in 2023 already. We issued $4 billion a debt in February, and just recently in July, we issued $3.25 billion worth of debt. So we feel pretty good about our capital structure. 2023 is pretty much taken care of, which is our largest maturity tower, I think about $6.4 billion and that it steps down from there in 2024 and 2025, so we feel pretty good about that.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks Shannon. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Keith Bachman with BMO. Your line is open.\nKeith Bachman: Hi, many thanks and echo the congratulations and strategic correction. Jim, I just wanted to see if you could provide a clarification, what was the M&A contribution this quarter, and if you could give any distinction on the M&A contribution that the software. And then my broader question it relates to going back to services. The signings was down about 2% in constant currency for the quarter. How do you anticipate signings unfolding and what does that pretend for next year\u2019s growth, particularly as we look at a bumpier economy, particularly in Europe? And so Arvind, you mentioned that you\u2019re affirming the mid-single digit total revenue growth, but if you could just talk a little bit about the services business in particular, which I think is perhaps has a bit more risk associated with some of the consulting activities in a tougher economic climate? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Hey, Keith, I\u2019ll take the front end of this and then Arvind can talk about the environment and our services portfolio overall. Really getting right to it, our inorganic contribution in the quarter to IBM was about one-point worth of growth overall. When you take a look at that, we grew 6.5 at actual rates, roughly 15% at constant currency, 5 points of that being Kyndryl year-to-year contribution. So read that about end points worth of growth. One-point of that came out of acquisitions. Underneath that, it\u2019s still about 2 points in consulting, which we\u2019re seeing nice scale of the consulting acquisitions. And again, as I said on the previous question, we do see margin accretion as we kind of get to a stabilized level of our acquisition. And to software basically rounded to zero, it\u2019s all organic growth software had a very strong quarter, 14% growth at constant currency, about 8 points of that being Kyndryl, that is all organic because we\u2019ve wrapped on our Turbonomic acquisition, which by the way still is done extremely well. So the currency, excuse me, the inorganic component is pretty much on a sustainable basis right now overall. Before I turn it over to Arvind, let\u2019s just talk a little bit about what we see underneath signings. First of all, we still have a \u2013 we believe a solid book-to-bill. On a trailing 12 months it\u2019s 1.05 and remember that\u2019s maintaining a book-to-bill in excess of one on very strong revenue contribution. Five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and year-to-date we\u2019re up in the high teens overall. So where do we see it underneath, because I think as I\u2019ve said many times before, all signings are not alike and they all don\u2019t translate the revenue the same way. When we look at our strong demand, it\u2019s driven by application modernization, strategic partnerships; by the way the velocity of our strategic partnership signings are up trailing 12 months, almost 25% to 30%, and it\u2019s about 40% of our business. now we\u2019re capturing that. Red Hat inception to date $6.6 billion, but it\u2019s really the small deal momentum. We\u2019re seeing the durations of our backlog come down a couple months because our small deals, that\u2019s the volume based business for six consecutive quarters in a row. We\u2019ve had double digit growth and what does that mean? That has high revenue yielding contribution in period. And that\u2019s what gives us the confidence when we look at that backlog realization and how it plays out for fourth quarter for us to commit the low-double-digit revenue growth.\nArvind Krishna: Yeah. So thanks Jim. So Keith, let me just maybe use the opportunity to remind everybody of what we had talked about as our midterm model, which was sort of the three-year model that we had laid out last October. We had said that we expect software to grow in mid-single digits, so I think 4% or 6%, and we had said consulting to grow in high single digits. And we had said that infrastructure will be about flat, this year will be a good year because the product cycle and then probably somewhere in late 2023 or 2024 we\u2019ll get the flip side of that up from this year. But then you get into consulting, our long-term model was not in the teens, which it has done this year it was in the high-single-digits. So the book-to-bill combined with the shorter term signings gives us confidence that we will be able to maintain that model. Look, I think consulting to the point I think you\u2019re all trying to ask, the nature of our consulting business is very different than some others. The bulk of our consulting business is in digital transformation, helping our clients move to cloud, not just our cloud but AWS and Azure amongst it. It\u2019s on properties that I think are fairly essential to our clients SAP, CRM, Adobe are great examples. As you begin to wrap around help them move to cloud, both public and hybrid, help them do digital transformation, help them take advantage of these massive productivity SaaS properties that I just named. Even in an inflationary environment, even when the economy is not doing well, these tend to be the projects that stay the course, but maybe the signings come in smaller chunks and as long as we deliver well then people tend to sign up for more and more going forward. And that\u2019s sort of a bit of color of what we\u2019ve seen play out already this year and we expect that to maybe increase next year.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Keith. Let\u2019s take one last question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me and I know we\u2019ve covered a lot of ground already and Jim, you\u2019ve done a very good job of summarizing, how you\u2019re going to get to that $10 billion of free cash flow for the year. I was wondering if I could just follow one thing up there though, last quarter I think you talked about $500 million to $700 million of structural actions, I think in the 2022 free cash flow guide, if I\u2019m remembering right, which should not reoccur. And I think we need to add to that, the exit from Russia and FX, which I think you highlighted both. However, any chance you could help to mention those last two items, so we could get just a better baseline, going into next year?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, David. Thank you and thanks for the compliments really goes out to the entire IBM team overall. When you take a look at our free cash flow posture one, I think we have quantified back in earlier this year in April about our Russia business, orderly wind down right decision, unfortunate humanitarian crisis that continues right now, but that was about a $300 million revenue profile and about a $200 million profit and cash profile overall. As I said yes, that\u2019s been an impact this year, which is one of the reasons why we went down to about $10 billion as we stated. But again, we\u2019ve been taking, knowing that decision, we\u2019ve been taking the right operational actions to drive the productivity knowing that 2023 and 2024 we won\u2019t have that. So that\u2019s point number one. Point number two, the structural actions yes, north of $500 million that\u2019s behind us this year. Remember that becomes a tailwind in 2023 and 2024. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve said multiple times before free cash flow is not going to be linear when we look at 2022, 2023, 2024. One we will have the wrap on that in 2023 plus second the exit costs of getting rid of that stranded cost, you get ROI on that activity overall. The big wildcard if you want to use it is what\u2019s going to happen to the U.S. dollar. Now you see what\u2019s happened to us this year. This year, third quarter let\u2019s put it in perspective as I said a little over eight point gap between constant currency and actual rates. As you\u2019ve seen in our backup charts, it\u2019s about a $1.1 billion revenue by the way, that\u2019s about a $0.15 profit and EPS impact in a quarter that we\u2019ve had to overcome operationally. Now that again will continue to the extent the U.S. dollar doesn\u2019t devalue over time. We are taking the appropriate measures. We\u2019re running our scenario models or stress testing our business. We\u2019ve got a long path into 2023 and 2024, but it\u2019s going to come from the actions I talked about price, sourcing and cost structure. Each of those pieces are going to have to overcome that. And the beauty of our hedging program is it buys us time to smooth out the volatility of earnings right now. So we are focused on that. We\u2019ll talk a lot more about where we see the U.S. dollar 90 days ago from now and what that means for 2023 cash as we go forward. Now, one last thing I want to put in place that fourth quarter cash is very important. That $6 billion give or take in us delivering that about $10 billion that is going to come out predominantly out of our operational profit driven by one, that revenue growth at the high end of our model all in, by the way anniversary of Kyndryl, we got two more weeks and we anniversary that, that is offset by basically Watson Health, so all-in high single-digit model is a good representation of today\u2019s IBM. Second, we expect 2.5 points of operating margin in the fourth quarter. Why is that important? Yes, it\u2019s going to deliver that free cash flow in the fourth quarter, but it also gives the investor a perspective now that we\u2019re basically anniversarying the year-to-year contribution at Kyndryl; you see the healthy operating leverage at this portfolio now that we were reposition can deliver. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Patricia.\nArvind Krishna: Okay. Thanks Jim and I think Jim gave you all a lot of color in these Q&A on cash flow, the quarter and how we think of a business going forward. Let me just wrap up the call. We have made really good progress since we laid out our strategy in our Investor Day last October. We are well positioned to meet our clients\u2019 needs going into the end of the year and we look forward to taking you through our fourth quarter performance and our view of 2023 in January. I look forward to speaking to all of you again in soon.\nPatricia Murphy: Gail [ph], let us turn it back over to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights. In the third quarter we delivered $14.1 billion in revenue, $2 billion of operating pre-tax income at a margin of nearly 14% and operating earnings per share of $1.81. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated over $4 billion of free cash flow. Revenue was up 15%, which includes about five points of contribution from sales to Kyndryl. While we'll discuss our results today at constant currency, I'll mention that with the continuing strengthening of the U.S. dollar, currency translation impacted our reported revenue growth by more than eight points or nearly $1.1 billion. As Arvind said, our revenue growth this quarter was pervasive. Software revenue was up 14% and consulting up 16%. These are our growth vectors and represent over 70% of our revenue. Infrastructure was up 23%, reflecting solid product cycle dynamics. Software and Infrastructure include about eight and nine points of growth respectively. From the commercial relationship with Kyndryl, more than half of our revenue is recurring and this annuity content, which is driven by software, continues to grow. Performance was also broad-based by geography. Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific revenue were all up double digits and we gained share overall. These revenue results reflect the execution of a more focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy based on a platform-centric approach and leveraging a broad ecosystem of partners. Our full stack capabilities across software, consulting and infrastructure delivered 20% growth in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year to over $22 billion. Looking at our profit metrics, operating pre-tax income was up and margin expanded by 180 basis points year-to-year. These profit dynamics reflect our portfolio shift toward higher value led by software. This mix shift is contributing to profit and margin. Our pre-tax profit also includes the contribution from incremental sales to Kyndryl. Like our clients, we are focused on digitally transforming our own operations, applying AI and automation to drive productivity and efficiency in the spend base. This provides flexibility to continue to invest in talent, innovation and our ecosystem in an inflationary environment. 90 days ago we spent some time talking about currency dynamics. I'll remind you of a few of the key points. A stronger dollar impacts our revenue and gross profit dollars. We execute a hedging program which defers versus eliminates the impact of currency. The gains from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense, but with the rate and magnitude of the movements and because we don't hedge all currencies, we do have a currency impact to our overall profit and cash flow. Wrapping up the discussion on profit dynamics, the currency impacts and a good amount of investments are in gross profit, while the mitigating hedging benefits and operational productivity are reflected primarily in expense. As a result, pre-tax income is a better indicator of our profit performance. Our operating tax rate was about 16%. Compared to last year tax is a significant year-to-year headwind to operating net income and operating EPS growth, which were both down modestly year-to-year. Turning to free cash flow. We generated $4.1 billion in the first three quarters. That's up over $900 million year-to-year. We're wrapping on payments related to the Kyndryl separation and the 2020 structural action and driving working capital efficiencies. In terms of uses of cash in the first three quarters, we invested over $1 billion in acquisitions, which was more than offset by proceeds from divested businesses. And we returned nearly $4.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we issued debt in July to prudently get ahead of our 2023 maturities. Our debt balance is up since June but down nearly $1 billion since December. We ended the quarter in a strong liquidity position with cash of $9.7 billion. This is up over $2 billion from year-end and well in excess of the minimum cash required for our business. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 14%. This includes about eight points of Kyndryl contribution. Both of our revenue categories, hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing through this quarter. This performance reflects our strong and growing recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of our annual software revenue. And Software's hybrid cloud revenue is now $9.2 billion over the last year, up 20%. In hybrid platform and solutions, revenue was up 8%, including about 1.5 contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. The growth was broad-based. Red Hat revenue all-in grew 18%. As a leader in open source technologies for the enterprise, Red Hat's performance was again fueled by market share gains across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible this quarter. With our enterprise incumbency and global scale, we continue to see an increase in large deals as well as strong cross-sell and upsell across Red Hat solutions. Automation revenue grew 3%. This quarter's performance reflects continued adoption in areas like AIOps and management and integration, while we're also wrapping a strong acquisition content from last year. We're bringing innovation to our clients this quarter such as new Instana Observability capabilities for z Systems in a hybrid cloud environment. In data and AI, revenue was up 4%. Let me highlight just a few of the growth areas this quarter. Data management fuels advanced analytics. Data fabric helps clients discover and unlock the value of their data wherever it resides, and information exchange enables the timely and secure flow of complex B2B information. And offerings like Envizi and Environmental Intelligence Suite are resonating with clients as they prioritize sustainability efforts. Security revenue was up 6%, with growth in both data security and threat management. In data security, we're seeing adoption of Guardium Insights as we continue to deliver new product innovation. Brent management growth was led by Cloud Pak for Security, which helps clients prevent and respond to modern threats across disparate security feeds. Across hybrid platform and solutions, the annual recurring revenue, or ARR is now $13 billion and up 9%. Transaction processing revenue was up 33%, including about 26 points of Kyndryl contribution. The increase in z Systems' installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and continued strong renewal rates are recognition of the importance of this platform in a hybrid cloud environment. As a result, the transaction processing annuity base is now growing. Looking at software profit, we delivered operating leverage, given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up more than four points over last year. Consulting revenue grew 16%. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This strong performance was again broad-based with revenue growing at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Over the last year, our book-to-bill ratio is 1.05. Clients trust IBM's deep industry expertise and co-creation approach throughout their hybrid cloud and digital transformation journeys. As IBM Consulting designs and enables enterprise hybrid cloud strategies, this business delivered $8.9 billion in hybrid cloud revenue over the last year. That's up 28%. Our Red Hat consulting practice continues to be a meaningful contributor to revenue growth, growing strong double-digits as we add new engagements. Since IBM acquired Red Hat just over three years ago, Consulting has led nearly 1,400 Red Hat engagements with over $6.5 billion in aggregate bookings. Strategic partnerships also contributed to performance, continuing to grow revenue at a double-digit rate. Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 14% as clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive, driven by supply chain, finance, data and client experience transformations. Working with our partners like SAP, Salesforce and Adobe, we help our clients optimize their operations and improve the way they engage with their customers. In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 17%. Once again, growth was led by cloud application development and cloud modernization, including our Red Hat practice, which as I mentioned, grew strong double digits. Application operations revenue grew 17%. IBM helps clients optimize their operations and reduce costs by taking over the management of clients' applications in hybrid and multi-cloud environments. We leverage AI to help predict problems before they happen and monitor our clients' different environments with dashboards, enabling action to be taken quickly. Moving to Consulting profit. Our pre-tax margin of about 10% is down year-to-year though up nearly 3 points from the second quarter. As we've discussed in prior quarters, Consulting is most impacted by the labor cost inflation. Those dynamics continue to put pressure on the margin profile. However, coming out of the third quarter, we are seeing signs of progress. Our utilization rates are improving as we exited the quarter, our acquisitions are scaling and are on a path to margin accretion, and we've seen two quarters of price margin improvement year-over-year that will benefit our margin profile going forward. Moving to our Infrastructure segment. Revenue grew 23%. This includes about 9 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid infrastructure revenue grew 41% and Infrastructure Support revenue grew 5%, including about 11 and 7 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively. Looking at hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue nearly doubled, driven by continued adoption of our newest program, z16. This latest program combines embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security. In fact, z16 is the industry's first quantum-safe system, delivering 25 billion encrypted transactions per day for clients. And as Arvind mentioned, we just introduced our newest LinuxONE server, a highly scalable Linux and Kubernetes-based platform with capabilities to reduce clients' energy consumption. zSystems remains an enduring platform, playing an important role in a hybrid cloud environment. Distributed Infrastructure revenue was up 21%. Recent innovation across the portfolio enabled broad-based growth within both storage and power. These include the expansion of our Power10 server family earlier this quarter and refreshes to the flash storage solutions throughout this year. Looking at Infrastructure profit, pre-tax margin was up 1 point year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems. Now let me take it back up to the IBM level, and I'll shift the focus to the full year and the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we've continued to invest and make portfolio changes to advance our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, streamline our go-to-market and digitally transform our own operations. Our more focused strategy and portfolio is aligned to client needs. Our revenue performance so far this year demonstrates that. And based on this revenue performance in the first three quarters, as Arvind said, we now see constant currency revenue growth above our mid-single digit model for the year. On top of that, Kyndryl sales add about 3.5 points of growth, primarily in the first three quarters of the year so it's essentially behind us. U.S. dollar continues to strengthen. And at mid-October spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 7-point headwind to growth for the year. As I mentioned earlier, this impacts profit and free cash flow as well. Looking at free cash flow, our other key metric, we continue to expect to generate about $10 billion for the year. That's up over $3 billion from last year. A large part of that growth comes from the wrap on the Kyndryl spin-related and structural payments. But we're also driving working capital efficiency and improving operating profit profile. We expect strong free cash flow performance in the fourth quarter, while we continue to face some external headwinds, including appreciation of the U.S. dollar and exit of our Russia operations. In terms of segment performance for 2022, our view of software has been consistent all year. We continue to expect revenue growth in line with our mid-single digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. And we still see software pre-tax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022. Our IBM Consulting revenue growth has been great, and we're taking our view up to a mid-teens revenue growth rate for the year. While we're still operating in a competitive labor environment, we see some encouraging signs in our Consulting margin profile exiting the third quarter. We now expect a Consulting pre-tax margin for the year at the low end of our previous 9% to 10% range, which is up about a point year-to-year. Our Infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. With the strong launch of our z16 earlier this year, Infrastructure revenue performance will be above the model level for the year, and that's before the 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We expect Infrastructure pre-tax margin in the mid-teens. Looking specifically at the fourth quarter, we expect all-in constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit range. At current spot rates, currency translation has increased to an 8 to 9-point headwind to revenue growth in the fourth quarter. That's up 2 to 3 points from 90 days ago. And then I'll remind you, in a couple of weeks, we'll reach the anniversary of our separation of Kyndryl. While the external sales to Kyndryl will remain in our revenue and profit base, we've essentially wrapped around the year-to-year contribution to our revenue and profit growth and margin expansion. As we enter the fourth quarter, we look forward to closing out our first calendar year of today's IBM. As always, we'll provide a view of 2023 during our fourth quarter earnings report in January. Patricia, now let's go on to the Q&A. Okay. Toni, this is Jim, I'll take the first part of the question and Arvind can wrap up about our portfolio and the confidence we have in positioning 2023. When you take a look at our third quarter performance, we're obviously very pleased with the entire IBM team and what we've been able to execute. Continuing to instantiate the value of today's IBM, which is a very focused hybrid cloud and AI platform company. But let's dial back 90 days ago. 90 days ago we said all in we were going to be at high single digit revenue growth and we were going to generate about 200 basis points of operating leverage. When you now play that picture of what played out in the third quarter, we are capitalizing on that focused IBM hybrid cloud AI strategy and capitalizing on the accelerated demand from our clients that Arvind talked about up front. And we're getting revenue dollar contribution that is falling to the bottom line with regards to profit. Our profit's up 23%. Now with that said, when you look at the profile of the contribution, it was very pervasive and broad based. It was double digit growth across all three of our major segments and double digit growth across all of our markets around the world. And within that software contributed about 3 points of growth ex Red Hat to IBM, consulting delivered about 5 points of growth and infrastructure delivered about 3 points of growth to IBM. And within infrastructure, to your question on mainframe, mainframe basically came in about exactly what we guided to 90 days ago. Remember, we talked about at length the first time in 20 years that we announced a mainframe new innovation in a second quarter and how it was going to change the seasonality of that business. And we had a very strong second quarter, which by the way, we took up revenue guidance in April 4. We talked about 90 days ago how third quarter was going to play out and fourth quarter and we pretty much executed to that. So we feel pretty good about our book of business. So, Arvind turning over to you. So Wamsi to that point, as you know, our two key measures of success since Arvind has taken over as Chairman and CEO has been revenue growth profile, converting this portfolio into a sustainable growth orientation and second free cash flow generation. So, we can have the financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business. And on that, we said maintaining guidance of about $10 billion. I'll remind everyone that $10 billion is up over $3 billion year-to-year, first. And it's up $2 billion from what we published as IBM's post-separation baseline when you normalize out all the Kyndryl-related activity. So as we spoke about, and Arvind just kind of concluded before he turned over to me, 90 days ago, this takes into account the external headwinds we've been talking about this year. One, being the orderly wind down in the exit of our Russia business, which we've already taken into account. We've been transforming our business and cost structure to take into account losing that high value profit and cash. And second is the continuance strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Now the latter, let's be honest, it definitely puts pressure and our midterm outlook, but we're three quarters into that midterm outlook right now. We do have a robust hedging program because we are not immune. I mean, we do business in 170 countries around the world, over a 100 currencies. As we talked about 90 days ago, we do not hedge, a 100% of our currencies. And second, we don't hedge out more than 12 months. Very important point. So currency is a real impact to profit in cash overall. Now, we hedge to provide us time to take the operational actions that's price, that's sourcing strategies, that's cost structure, and the productivity initiatives that Arvind and I have put within the business. So right now, it's early in this midterm outlook. We've got a headwind on the U.S. dollar until it stabilizes. We are taking the appropriate actions, but let's be honest, we are all focused on completing 2022. We have a very big fourth quarter in front of us. We've got to do roughly $6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter. That's about 60% of our free cash flow, by the way to put that in perspective, from 2017 to 2020, we did at or better than $6 million of free cash flow. So, we've got the right portfolio. We've got the right set of operational actions, and that's what we're focused on. Where are we going to get that headwind/tailwind? One, we completed our structural action. So that's all behind us, and we'll continue to get the Kyndryl tailwind for the next three months. Second, we expect a very solid working capital quarter with regards to the mainframe cycle and the pure volume dynamics of what's happening with our accelerated revenue growth profile. And third, we're going to continue driving a higher revenue profile, get operating cash out of that by driving operating leverage in our business. So that's what our focus is on completing 2022. And we will talk in January about where we're at and where the dollar's at. Yes, Erik, thank you very much. I appreciate the question and I appreciate the compliments and I'm sure the entire IBM team has worked extremely hard pleased with this quarter. Well, let's talk about Consulting. We talked all year long, remember you dialed back to January. We were talking about what we were seeing in the marketplace about an accelerating demand profile driven by our clients' digital transformations, journeys to cloud, and that we were going to invest upfront and get ahead of that demand profile both in skills, capabilities, ecosystems, acquisitions, why? Because Consulting plays an integral part to our hybrid cloud thesis. It is that tip of the spear. It drives the multiplier effect. It drags the scale and adoption to our hybrid cloud platform, and it pulls our IBM technology. Now, with that said, when you look at it that investment profile coupled with a highly inflationary environment. We've seen pressure on our gross margin level throughout the year. But we've been making that up on an operating pre-tax margin because Consulting, along with our Infrastructure and Software are yielding the benefits of a much more focused streamlined G&A structure, now post-separation of Kyndryl and a much more effective and aligned streamlined go-to-market model that's playing out. But when you look at it, 3Q year-to-date, our revenue profiles growing high teens. We're getting dollar contribution, and we're seeing 3Q year-to-date at about 30 basis points worth of margin. Now, as I said in the prepared remarks, we talked about three core actions throughout the year, acquisitions, utilization, price. And around those we saw green shoots exiting third quarter. Our acquisitions right now, we're on a steady state where they're going to be margin accretive in the fourth quarter. Second, we exited the quarter in a pretty challenging seasonal quarter of a third quarter with higher utilizations. That's a great sign. And third, for the second quarter a row, we got price optimization in price margins that are up. That has led to our sequential improvement in margins from 2Q to 3Q by three points. And by the way, we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. Margins up sequentially and year-to-year. And that price optimization really as you would expect, always translates back then into the value proposition of your offerings where we have value in application modernization, Red Hat, our hyperscaler and strategic partnerships. We're seeing a nice margin accretion that's playing out and that's going to fuel the fourth quarter here and first half of 2023. Yes, no, I would just add to the last point on the interest rate environment. Shannon, as you saw during this year, we've been prudent. I think in hindsight now, it's always better to be lucky and opportunistic because we've went out to the market and basically have pre-funded all of our requirements for the most part in 2023 already. We issued $4 billion a debt in February, and just recently in July, we issued $3.25 billion worth of debt. So we feel pretty good about our capital structure. 2023 is pretty much taken care of, which is our largest maturity tower, I think about $6.4 billion and that it steps down from there in 2024 and 2025, so we feel pretty good about that. Hey, Keith, I'll take the front end of this and then Arvind can talk about the environment and our services portfolio overall. Really getting right to it, our inorganic contribution in the quarter to IBM was about one-point worth of growth overall. When you take a look at that, we grew 6.5 at actual rates, roughly 15% at constant currency, 5 points of that being Kyndryl year-to-year contribution. So read that about end points worth of growth. One-point of that came out of acquisitions. Underneath that, it's still about 2 points in consulting, which we're seeing nice scale of the consulting acquisitions. And again, as I said on the previous question, we do see margin accretion as we kind of get to a stabilized level of our acquisition. And to software basically rounded to zero, it's all organic growth software had a very strong quarter, 14% growth at constant currency, about 8 points of that being Kyndryl, that is all organic because we've wrapped on our Turbonomic acquisition, which by the way still is done extremely well. So the currency, excuse me, the inorganic component is pretty much on a sustainable basis right now overall. Before I turn it over to Arvind, let's just talk a little bit about what we see underneath signings. First of all, we still have a \u2013 we believe a solid book-to-bill. On a trailing 12 months it's 1.05 and remember that's maintaining a book-to-bill in excess of one on very strong revenue contribution. Five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth and year-to-date we're up in the high teens overall. So where do we see it underneath, because I think as I've said many times before, all signings are not alike and they all don't translate the revenue the same way. When we look at our strong demand, it's driven by application modernization, strategic partnerships; by the way the velocity of our strategic partnership signings are up trailing 12 months, almost 25% to 30%, and it's about 40% of our business. now we're capturing that. Red Hat inception to date $6.6 billion, but it's really the small deal momentum. We're seeing the durations of our backlog come down a couple months because our small deals, that's the volume based business for six consecutive quarters in a row. We've had double digit growth and what does that mean? That has high revenue yielding contribution in period. And that's what gives us the confidence when we look at that backlog realization and how it plays out for fourth quarter for us to commit the low-double-digit revenue growth. Yes, David. Thank you and thanks for the compliments really goes out to the entire IBM team overall. When you take a look at our free cash flow posture one, I think we have quantified back in earlier this year in April about our Russia business, orderly wind down right decision, unfortunate humanitarian crisis that continues right now, but that was about a $300 million revenue profile and about a $200 million profit and cash profile overall. As I said yes, that's been an impact this year, which is one of the reasons why we went down to about $10 billion as we stated. But again, we've been taking, knowing that decision, we've been taking the right operational actions to drive the productivity knowing that 2023 and 2024 we won't have that. So that's point number one. Point number two, the structural actions yes, north of $500 million that's behind us this year. Remember that becomes a tailwind in 2023 and 2024. That's why I've said multiple times before free cash flow is not going to be linear when we look at 2022, 2023, 2024. One we will have the wrap on that in 2023 plus second the exit costs of getting rid of that stranded cost, you get ROI on that activity overall. The big wildcard if you want to use it is what's going to happen to the U.S. dollar. Now you see what's happened to us this year. This year, third quarter let's put it in perspective as I said a little over eight point gap between constant currency and actual rates. As you've seen in our backup charts, it's about a $1.1 billion revenue by the way, that's about a $0.15 profit and EPS impact in a quarter that we've had to overcome operationally. Now that again will continue to the extent the U.S. dollar doesn't devalue over time. We are taking the appropriate measures. We're running our scenario models or stress testing our business. We've got a long path into 2023 and 2024, but it's going to come from the actions I talked about price, sourcing and cost structure. Each of those pieces are going to have to overcome that. And the beauty of our hedging program is it buys us time to smooth out the volatility of earnings right now. So we are focused on that. We'll talk a lot more about where we see the U.S. dollar 90 days ago from now and what that means for 2023 cash as we go forward. Now, one last thing I want to put in place that fourth quarter cash is very important. That $6 billion give or take in us delivering that about $10 billion that is going to come out predominantly out of our operational profit driven by one, that revenue growth at the high end of our model all in, by the way anniversary of Kyndryl, we got two more weeks and we anniversary that, that is offset by basically Watson Health, so all-in high single-digit model is a good representation of today's IBM. Second, we expect 2.5 points of operating margin in the fourth quarter. Why is that important? Yes, it's going to deliver that free cash flow in the fourth quarter, but it also gives the investor a perspective now that we're basically anniversarying the year-to-year contribution at Kyndryl; you see the healthy operating leverage at this portfolio now that we were reposition can deliver. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Patricia."

            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. The results we delivered in the third quarter reflect our continued focus on the execution of our strategy with over $14 billion of revenue and strong growth across the portfolio. Technology remains a fundamental source of competitive advantage and we continue to see solid demand for our hybrid cloud and AI solutions, continued double-digit revenue growth in IBM Consulting, capturing client demand for digital transformations. Software revenue performance was also strong with growth across all categories and our infrastructure business had another high growth quarter in both Z systems and Distributed Infrastructure. Our revenue strength was broad based geographically as well. When I talk with clients it's clear there's a real opportunity to help businesses leverage technology in today's environments. Clients are dealing with everything from inflation to demographic shifts from supply chain bottlenecks to sustainability efforts. By deploying powerful hybrid cloud and AI technologies, IBM is helping businesses seize new opportunities, overcome today's challenges and emerge stronger. We too are building a stronger company that is closely aligned to the needs of our clients. In line with our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, we have continued to focus our portfolio, invest in our offerings, technical talent and ecosystem, and streamline our go-to-market model. With strong performance through the first three quarters, we are taking up our revenue expectations for the year and now expect 2022 revenue above our mid single digit model. Let me now turn to the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy. Our point of view is clear. Hybrid cloud and AI are the two most transformational enterprise technologies of our time. Hybrid cloud is already becoming the dominant architecture for enterprise. According to a recent survey by The Harris Poll, 77% of businesses surveyed said they have adopted hybrid cloud for their organizations with data located across multiple clouds on-premise or at the edge. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can drive value across these different environments. Our platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume software driven by open source innovation. IBM software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and security capabilities. Our consultants offer deep business expertise and co-create with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys and our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of a hybrid cloud environment. Our platform centric strategy continues to have good momentum adding a couple of hundred hybrid cloud platform clients in the third quarter. We see more and more clients consuming across our portfolio of software, consulting and infrastructure capabilities. This quarter clients such as Bank of America, Bharti Airtel and Samsung Electronics have chosen IBM to realize the full potential of a hybrid cloud computing model.  Let me now say a few words about our AI capabilities. As demographic shifts continue to add pressure to modern economies coupled with wage inflation, companies are eager to deploy AI and automation capabilities at scale to boost their levels of productivity. That is what IBM is helping companies bring to bear. In the context of our enterprise, we are seeing four main use cases emerge: AI to interact and converse. AI to automate IT processes, AI to extract knowledge and insights, and finally, AI to automate business workflows such as HR, supply chains and financial reporting. We are working to bring these capabilities to clients across all industries. For instance, this quarter, IBM Consulting partnered with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to automate business workflows related to the delivery of pension benefits. This helps free up valuable time of VA staffs and speed up the processing of claims made by the veterans most in need. Our partner ecosystem is a crucial element of our strategy. Each quarter we continue to expand the work we do with partners to serve our joint clients. For instance, we recently announced an expansion of our partnership with VMware to help clients and regulated industries more easily move workloads to the cloud with IBM Consulting now serving as a GSI partner for VMware. We announced that Red Hat and Dell are launching a set of containerized solutions aimed at simplifying the management of multi-cloud environments on-premise. Gartner predicts that by 2026 90% of organizations will use containers. These actions represent another step in our efforts to seize this opportunity through ecosystem relationships and our technology offerings. We are actively working to introduce new innovation and shape the technologies of the future. Most recently, we unveiled the next generation of our LinuxONE server, a Linux and Kubernetes-based platform designed to support thousands of workloads within the footprint of a single system. As an example, Citibank is hosting MongoDB on IBM LinuxONE, leveraging the platform security, resiliency and elastic capacity, and helping Citi lower its overall carbon footprint. We also continue to make progress in quantum computing. We remain on track towards our goal of building a 1,000-qubit system by 2023. To advance the security of our communication networks, IBM alongside Vodafone, recently joined the GSMA's Post-Quantum Telco Network Taskforce. This taskforce aims to introduce a framework for the telco industry to adopt new quantum safe approaches. Complementing our organic innovation, we recently acquired Dialexa. This brings our total number of acquisitions this year to seven, adding new capabilities in areas like hybrid cloud services, security, data observability and sustainability. As the world takes on the challenge of sustainability and building a more circular economy, IBM has been building a portfolio of solutions to help companies make progress on this journey. This quarter, we received recognition highlighting our sustainability efforts. The analyst firm, HFS Research and Forbes, both recognized IBM for its capabilities in the area of sustainability, including Envizi and our Environmental Intelligence Suite software. Let me conclude by reminding you that last October and just prior to the separation of Kyndryl, we held our investor briefing laying out priorities for our portfolio and growth. Over the last four quarters, we have driven constant currency revenue growth at or above our mid-single digit model with solid free cash flow. And while there is always more to do, we are pleased with our first year's progress. As we look forward, we remain confident in our strategy and execution and feel we are well positioned to address today's client needs. Let me now turn it over to Jim who will provide more details on the quarter and our expectations for the balance of the year. Yes. Amit, thank you. Thank you both for the comment and those questions. So let me answer the first part, how do we feel about revenue and demand going forward? First, if you just look at the data going backwards, we see pretty strong demand and we saw double-digit growth in Europe, double-digit growth in Asia and double-digit growth in the Americas. But let me add some color on that as we look forward. And it is with a couple of contextual elements, as you said, on your portfolio. One, we are B2B. We have almost no B2C business, as if almost no, I could say none, but there is the weather business which has got a little bit of element of B2C in it, but it's tiny. So one is B2B. Second, we've done a lot of work over the last three years, and our portfolio is largely in mission-critical areas, areas that are around automation, areas that are about leveraging AI for enterprise productivity. And I think that, that productivity theme is going to play out over actually not just this remaining part of this year but for the next half decade, maybe the full decade. Color. In the Americas, I find a very robust business environment. I find that most enterprises want to invest. They are leveraging technology to scale their business. If I go to Asia, it's very similar. Very little change from the past, I think going into the next few months, at least. In Europe, I think we shouldn't put our head in the sand. I think that with the mixture of energy and inflation, you can sense that there is some caution creeping into the conversations, albeit not in the data and not yet in what we are doing as business there. But we'd be foolish not to prepare that there could be a bit of a downturn in Europe only. But let me now put all of that back into context. So you're saying Americas, Asia, fine. If I get to Europe, Western Europe, ballpark 20% of global GDP. Even if you have a massive impact, 5% to 10%, that's a 1% to 2% impact on a global level all-in. Technology is typically 3% to 4% ahead of GDP growth. That says there's still a robust technology environment in there. So I think that's the sort of the two parts of your question that that we are addressing with that. Yes. Thanks Jim. Turning to sort of address the questions, last October we talked about that we are going to be in a mid single digit revenue growth model and that we will be increasing cash flow each year and we have set out a target of $10 billion for this year and $35 billion over the period. There is nothing that we see right now to alter us from what we had said at that time. So I'm going to say that those projections stay in place. As Jim pointed out for 2022, we are saying that we will be above our revenue model and that we believe will play out with the demand that you heard me talk about and then Jim just reinforced. Just a little part, the third quarter is not typically a big ELA quarter, so we should just be \u2013 it's kind of the normal seasonality. ELAs are really second and fourth much more than first and third. So just to give you a little bit of color and add to what you asked and what Jim said, mainframe hardware has had a strong start. So you would expect that capacity increases. As the capacity increases, you expect that to follow with a tiny lag, sometimes a month, sometimes three months into our transaction processing portfolio. And that's why you kind of see the strength there. So Wamsi, let me start and then give it to Jim. But I'm also going to reinforce a couple points that Jim made in his prepared remarks. On transactional business, look, I can't speak to the yield. I can speak to the yield about 10 weeks from now. The yield will come in over the next 10 weeks as opposed to right now. If I look at our pipeline, pipeline indicates the strength that we are seeing. That is what gave us confidence to say that we see revenue coming in above our mid-single digit growth model. We see the pipelines are strong across software and hardware. So the very strong hardware growth in the third quarter that is captured in the infrastructure business, I think that all reflects the demand that is there and across geographies. So not any particular single market being strong. If I look at, then software, I expect that the overall growth will remain strong. Would there be some puts and takes in a couple of small countries as possible. But that is the advantage of having a business that goes across 170 countries where that tends to get absorbed into the overall. Right now, I tell you, good pipelines based on the first nine months of the year, we expect yields to remain good or even better than before. And that's this piece. And I'll just make a comment. I would like to say, as Jim pointed out in his prepared remarks that there is an impact on FX that is probably the biggest impact to what we are seeing right now. I certainly, I'll say hope that we are seeing the end of the dollar strengthening as opposed to another significant change. Shannon, let me start by this thing. First, let me explain our rationale and our principles for acquisitions because it's important to understand that it's not so much size. Number one, they've got to fit our strategy. Our strategy being hybrid cloud and AI. And in Consulting, those which add to our ecosystem growth and our talent. So that limits the universe of what we would look at. Two, especially if it's going to be larger, it's got to be accretive. Whether we talk about at the end of the first year or definitely in the second year, it's got to be accretive to cash flow. Three, there's got to be synergy with IBM. Like Jim mentioned about the $6 billion in inception to date signings and the 1,400 projects that consulting did with Red Hat, that synergy, meaning that we would not have gotten that revenue and that book of business if we had not done that acquisition. So then if I say that those are criteria, those would be criteria that would open up if there is something that is larger with the correct valuation and the correct economic returns for the company. Now, to your point on interest rates. Certainly, interest rates have an impact, but we'd also like to say there are multiple vehicles on how to raise cash, because the overall fin flex and we had talked about $20 billion of fin flex over the period, but there are other vehicles for also raising cash when we are an attractive target for the acquisition to come into. Jim? Yeah. So thanks Jim. So Keith, let me just maybe use the opportunity to remind everybody of what we had talked about as our midterm model, which was sort of the three-year model that we had laid out last October. We had said that we expect software to grow in mid-single digits, so I think 4% or 6%, and we had said consulting to grow in high single digits. And we had said that infrastructure will be about flat, this year will be a good year because the product cycle and then probably somewhere in late 2023 or 2024 we'll get the flip side of that up from this year. But then you get into consulting, our long-term model was not in the teens, which it has done this year it was in the high-single-digits. So the book-to-bill combined with the shorter term signings gives us confidence that we will be able to maintain that model. Look, I think consulting to the point I think you're all trying to ask, the nature of our consulting business is very different than some others. The bulk of our consulting business is in digital transformation, helping our clients move to cloud, not just our cloud but AWS and Azure amongst it. It's on properties that I think are fairly essential to our clients SAP, CRM, Adobe are great examples. As you begin to wrap around help them move to cloud, both public and hybrid, help them do digital transformation, help them take advantage of these massive productivity SaaS properties that I just named. Even in an inflationary environment, even when the economy is not doing well, these tend to be the projects that stay the course, but maybe the signings come in smaller chunks and as long as we deliver well then people tend to sign up for more and more going forward. And that's sort of a bit of color of what we've seen play out already this year and we expect that to maybe increase next year. Okay. Thanks Jim and I think Jim gave you all a lot of color in these Q&A on cash flow, the quarter and how we think of a business going forward. Let me just wrap up the call. We have made really good progress since we laid out our strategy in our Investor Day last October. We are well positioned to meet our clients' needs going into the end of the year and we look forward to taking you through our fourth quarter performance and our view of 2023 in January. I look forward to speaking to all of you again in soon."

Now I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy with IBM. Ma'am, you may begin. \nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Presentation. I'm here with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. \n Provided additional information to our investors, our presentation includes non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation and in the 8-K submitted to the SEC. \n Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind. \nArvind Krishna: Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we drove solid results reflecting the investments and changes we have been making to execute our strategy. With this performance, we continue to deliver on our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth. \n Technology plays an important role in today's business environment. In fact, nearly every client I speak to believes that technology serves as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It serves as both a deflationary force and a force multiplier and is especially critical as clients face challenges on multiple fronts from supply chain bottlenecks to demographic shifts. \n Given its ability to boost innovation, productivity, resilience and help organizations scale, IT has become a high priority in our company's budget. As such, there is every reason to believe technology spending in the B2B space will continue to surpass GDP growth. \n With this demand backdrop, we are executing our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We have made changes to our portfolio and focused investments in our offerings, technical talent, our ecosystem and go-to-market model. \n Demand for our solutions remains strong. We continue to have double-digit performance in IBM Consulting, broad-based trend in software. And with the z16 platform launch, our infrastructure business had a good quarter. By integrating technology and expertise from IBM and our partners, our clients will continue to see our hybrid cloud and AI solutions as a crucial source of business opportunity and growth. \n Let me now delve a little bit deeper into the progress and the execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private clouds and on-premise properties, all the way to the edge. Our platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume powerful software capabilities driven by open source innovation. Our software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and the security capabilities our clients need. Our global team of consultants offers deep business expertise and cocreates with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. Our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. \n As a testament to the success of our strategy, we continue to increase adoption of our platform with over 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including more than 250 added in this past quarter alone. Apart from working with a greater number of clients, those who adopt our platform tend to consume more of our solutions across software, consulting and infrastructure, expanding our footprint within those clients. Recently, clients such as [ P&C ], Barclays and Citi have chosen our hybrid cloud capabilities to unlock more business value and meet rapidly changing client demands. \n Organizations everywhere are also under intense pressure to fast track their digital transformation and harness the power of the data. With the world now creating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day, artificial intelligence, or AI, is the only way to process this enormous amount of data from hybrid cloud environments all the way to the edge. That is why AI adoption is steadily on the rise. \n According to a new study released by IBM last quarter, 35% of companies are now using some form of AI in their business. Many of those companies are using AI and automation to address demographic shifts and move their employees to higher value work. This is one of the many reasons we are investing heavily in both AI and automation. These investments are paying off. \n In addition to the strong revenue performance in automation and data and AI software, we recently received 2 important recognitions. We were named as a leader in the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for APM and Observability and in The Forrester Data Fabric Wave for our Cloud Pak for data. \n Over the last several quarters, I've highlighted the importance of the growing ecosystem of partners to our platform-centric strategy with leading firms like SAP, Salesforce, Adobe, Oracle, Microsoft and AWS. This quarter, we continue to expand and extend our partnerships. I'll expand on just 2. \n We announced a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to offer a broad array of our software catalog on AWS. This includes capabilities that span Automation, Data & AI, Security and Sustainability. Second, with Tech Mahindra, we launched synergy lounges to empower businesses with the innovation technologies and services for key industries such as telecommunications, manufacturing, banking, health care, energy and utilities. The first synergy lounge was established in Bengaluru with a focus on edge, 5G and software-defined networking solutions with hybrid cloud. This will be followed by the opening of 3 more centers in London, Seattle and Melbourne. \n Clients aren't just simply buying software or hardware. They're entering a relationship with the company that's going to help them navigate the future of technology. This is why innovation and our ability to invent what's next remains so important. \n Quantum is a great example of our commitment to advance the future of technology. Building on our progress of 127 qubit Quantum computer currently in our cloud, we have committed to demonstrate the first 400-plus qubit system before year-end. This will help us move forward towards our road map to deliver 1,000-plus qubit system next year and a 4,000-plus qubit system in 2025. \n One of the implications of quantum computing will be the need to change how information is encrypted. We are proud that technology developed by IBM and our collaborators has been selected by NIST as the basis of the next generation of quantum-safe encryption protocols. \n In another example of innovation, our new z16 system became generally available in the second quarter. The z16 is designed for cloud native development; server security resilience; quantum-safe encryption; and includes an on-chip accelerator, which allows clients to reduce fraud within real-time transactions. \n Given the importance of cybersecurity, in this past quarter, we also acquired Randori, a leading attack surface management and offensive cybersecurity provider. This builds on the recent acquisition of ReaQta and the launch of QRadar XDR. It's one of 2 acquisitions in the second quarter and over 25% in the last 2 years. \n Another major focus area across all stakeholders is ESG, which isn't just a regulatory requirement or about being a good corporate citizen. It's also a business opportunity. A poll conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value shows that 50% of CEOs see sustainability as one of their highest priorities, and over 80% of CEOs believe their company's sustainability investments will improve business results and accelerate growth. To accomplish this, companies need to leverage AI and to turn the mountains of data they collect into sustainable action. \n SL Green Realty Corporation, Manhattan's largest office landlord, is a recent example. They are using Envizi, an IBM solution to manage their easy indicators across their extensive real estate operations, including energy use, carbon emissions and environmental and social responsibility metrics. \n Let me wrap up by saying that given the strength of our portfolio, the need for our technology and expertise with the benefits we're yielding from any actions, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenue in 2022 at the high end of our mid-single-digit model. \n Now let me hand it over to Jim, who will give you more detail on our second quarter performance and add color on our expectations for the balance of the year. \nJames Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.5 billion of operating pretax income, which is a margin of 16.2%; and operating earnings per share of $2.31. In the first half of the year, we generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue was up 16%. This includes nearly 5 points of incremental revenue from Kyndryl. \n As always, we discussed revenue growth at constant currency. But given the focus on the sharply strengthening dollar, I'll mention that currency translation impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points of growth or $900 million. That's over $200 million more than the spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago. \n Today's IBM has a higher growth profile driven by our growth vectors of software and consulting. More than half of our annual revenue is recurring, with about 2/3 of that in high-value software. Software revenue this past quarter was up 12%; and Consulting, up 18%. Infrastructure performance, which reflects a good start to our z16 product cycle, was up 25%. Software and infrastructure each include about 7 points of growth from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl. \n These results reflect the investments we've been making in innovation, our ecosystem and talent, all aligned to our strategic areas of hybrid cloud and AI. We integrate consulting and technology to deliver these hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Our platform approach not only benefits our clients but also provides an attractive economic model for IBM and our partners with a multiple of software and consulting revenue generated for every dollar of platform revenue. Our hybrid cloud revenue from our full stack capabilities across software, consulting and infrastructure was up 19% over the last year. It has grown to $21.7 billion or 36% of our total revenue. \n Looking at our P&L metrics. Operating gross profit dollars were up driven by strong revenue performance in our high-value businesses. Our year-to-year gross margin decline reflects escalating labor and component costs. We're addressing this through pricing, though it takes some time to show up in our margin profile, especially in consulting. Our operating pretax income was up, and we expanded margin by 420 basis points. We had an operating tax rate of about 16.5%, which is up about 2 points versus last year, and our operating net income margin expanded 330 basis points. \n Let me comment on a few dynamics within our profit performance. Our pretax profit reflects the benefit from actions we've taken to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model as well as profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship post separation. \n Our profit this quarter also reflects recent portfolio actions. At the end of June, we closed on the divestiture of our health care software assets, generating a pretax gain of about $230 million in the period. Mitigating that benefit to our overall profit results, we took charges to address stranded costs associated with the divestiture and absorbed operating losses related to the health business, together, over $75 million. \n We also announced the orderly wind down of our Russian operations, resulting in incremental charges in the quarter. Together with the year-to-year loss business due to the wind down, Russia impacted our profit results by another roughly $100 million. \n I also want to comment on the impact of currency. I mentioned that over the last 90 days, we've dealt with a sharply strengthening dollar. We execute hedge programs that cover the majority but not all of the currency exposure. The combination of the rate and velocity of movement this quarter and the fact that we don't hedge 100% results in a currency impact to our profit and cash flow. \n Turning to free cash flow. We generated over $2 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion for the first half with good working capital performance. This first half free cash flow is about 33% of our full year expected range, consistent with the average of the last few years. I'll remind you the $1 billion plus of proceeds from the health divestiture is reflected in cash from investing activities versus in our free cash flow. \n In terms of uses of cash for the first half, we invested nearly $1 billion in acquisitions with 5 closed this year, and we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a June cash position of nearly $8 billion, which is up slightly from year-end. And our debt of just over $50 billion is down about $1.5 billion over the same period. \n Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 12%. This includes about 7 points from the Kyndryl software content. Growth was driven by our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. Hybrid cloud revenue for the segment now represents $9 billion over the last year, up 23%. \n Software subscription and support renewal rates were up again this quarter. This contributes to our solid and growing recurring revenue base, which represents about 80% of software. From a revenue category perspective, our software growth vector of Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 9%. This includes about 1.5 points benefit from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. \n We again drove pervasive growth across Red Hat, Automation, Data & AI and Security. Red Hat revenue all in grew 17%. Revenue growth was fueled by new adoption and expansion of RHEL and OpenShift as both solutions continue to take share. These key offerings address hybrid cloud requirements in industries like financial services, public sector and telecommunications, across environments and out to the edge. \n Automation revenue was up 8%. Solid performance in both AI ops and management and integration demonstrates the importance of automation in the IT journeys of our clients. We had strength in offerings like Turbonomic and Instana for observability; Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps; and our modern integration platform, Cloud Pak for Integration. \n Data & AI revenue grew 4%. This growth was led by demand for data fabric, data management and asset and supply chain management solutions. We also just expanded our Data Fabric portfolio with the acquisition of Databand.ai, which helps organizations with data observability. \n Security revenue was up 5% with growth in threat management and identity as enterprises continue to adopt a Zero Trust security strategy and implement additional identity controls. We're continuing to invest in our security capabilities, having completed 2 acquisitions in the threat management space over the last few quarters. \n Across the 4 Hybrid Platform & Solution business areas, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is nearly $12.9 billion, up 8%. \n Turning to our software value vector, transaction processing, revenue grew 19%, including 22 points from the Kyndryl content. We continue to have strong renewal rates for this mission-critical software and performed in line with our expectations this quarter. \n Looking at software profit. We delivered operating leverage given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up 4 points and keeps us on track for a full year software margin in the mid-20s. \n Moving on to Consulting. We again saw pervasive growth with double-digit revenue growth across all business lines and geographies. Revenue was up 18% compared to 8% growth a year ago. We maintained a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 on a trailing 12-month basis as clients are choosing to co-create with IBM, trusting our deep industry expertise. \n The expansion of our skills, capabilities and ecosystems are enabling us to capture demand as we drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and help clients with their digital transformations. Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% over the last year to $8.6 billion. Momentum behind our Red Hat practice remains strong. We nearly doubled our Red Hat consulting revenue in the quarter and continued solid Red Hat bookings, which now exceeds $6 billion inception to date. \n Our strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships continue to grow solid double digits, led by Azure, AWS and SAP and Salesforce. \n Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation grew 16%. Its clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive and led by our offerings focused on customer experience transformation, data transformation and our SAP practices. \n In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 23%. Cloud modernization and cloud application development led a significant portion of the growth, with on-prem modernization also contributing to the strong revenue performance in the quarter. \n Application operations revenue grew 17%. Growth was solid across our cloud offerings, mitigated by declines in the on-prem space. In this business, we are optimizing the management of applications and providing cloud platform services required to run our clients' hybrid cloud environments. \n Moving to consulting profit. Our pretax margin expanded 1 point as we deliver operating leverage and benefit from IBM's more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting margins reflect the significant investments we have been making to capture demand and fuel our revenue growth. We continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, scale acquisitions and add skills. \n Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the inflationary labor market and increasing labor cost as we bring and increase capacity. We are starting to capture the reality of these higher costs in our pricing. But given the time from contract signing to revenue realization, it's taking some time to see it in our margins. \n Turning to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 25%, including about 7 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue grew 41%. And infrastructure support revenue grew 5%, including about 7 and 8 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively. \n Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue was up 77%. This reflects solid execution around our z16 program, building on the momentum from z15. As Arvind mentioned, z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilient security and cloud native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. We are seeing growth in new workloads like Linux and demand for AI capabilities like real-time fraud detection, leveraging the on-chip AI accelerator. Clients are investing in zSystems platform as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. \n Distributed infrastructure revenue grew 17% this quarter. This growth was led by storage, driven by both high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and distributed storage. We also had good performance in high-end Power10. Just last week, we announced the expansion of our Power10 server family as we deliver flexible and secure infrastructure for hybrid cloud environments. \n Looking at infrastructure profit, pretax margin was up 4 points year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems, mitigated by the impact of increased component cost and supplier premiums. \n Now let me take it back up to the IBM level. We've taken actions and made investments over the last couple of years to execute a platform-centric hybrid cloud and AI strategy. IBM is now a more focused, faster-growing and higher value company. And while there is always more work to do, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth. \n Our first half results were solid. We continue to see constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model for the full year. And on top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth from the Kyndryl sales spread over the first 3 quarters. \n I mentioned the impact of currency to our 2Q results. With the significant movement of the U.S. dollar as compared to nearly every currency, at mid-July spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 6-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. That's a degradation of about $1.5 billion from April's rates with most of that incremental impact still ahead of us in the second half. \n Currency is one unique issue we're dealing with. The other is the impact of exiting our Russia operation. Together, these are putting some pressure on our near-term results, and we now expect free cash flow of about $10 billion for the year. These are exogenous issues. Importantly, we feel good about the underlying fundamentals of our business. You see this in our segment expectations. Halfway through the year, there's no change to our full year view of software. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022. \n Our IBM consulting revenue growth has been strong, and we continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth rate for the year, which is above our model. With continued investment in skills and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a consulting pretax margin of 9% to 10%, which is up over 1 point year-to-year. This reflects improving margin performance in the second half as we increase utilization of the resources we've added and price realization starts to flow to revenue. \n Our infrastructure revenue in any period reflects product cycle dynamics. We had a very strong launch of our z16 platform in the second quarter. This will drive infrastructure revenue performance above the model level for the year. On top of that, we're planning for about 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from the sales to Kyndryl in 2022. Despite some of the pressures from component cost increases and supplier premiums, we continue to see mid- to high-teens pretax margin for infrastructure for the full year. \n These segment revenue and margin dynamics yield about a 3.5 point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax margin for the full year. And we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth. You'll recall that back in January, we expected a 40-60 first half/second half profit SKU. Now after a solid start to the year, our view hasn't changed, and we still see 60% of the full year profit in the second half. \n Looking at the third quarter, we expect all in constant currency revenue growth in the high single-digit range and about a 2-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin. I want to mention 2 specific items on the third quarter. First, at current spot rates, currency translation has increased to about an 8-point headwind to revenue growth, impacting our reported revenue, profit and cash. Second, we haven't had a zSystems product introduction in our large transactional second quarter in about 20 years. This unique timing, coupled with the strong start to the cycle, will result in a larger second to third quarter impact than typical seasonality. So to be clear, we expect a strong year-to-year growth in zSystems. \n In closing, these are interesting times, and we see technology as a way to help our enterprise clients capture today's opportunities and navigate challenges. We feel good about the strategy we are executing and the fundamentals of our business. \n Patricia, now let's go on to the Q&A. \nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. \nErik Woodring: Just one for me here. Obviously, we saw a bit of a deceleration in the Red Hat business. So would just love to hear what you're hearing from them and any impact that you could share with us on the deferred that's been a part of this business for a while? So that's it. \nArvind Krishna: Thank you, Erik, for the question. Let me start off by just -- we feel very good about the Red Hat business, and we see very strong demand continuing. That said, we had said late last year that we expect growth in Red Hat to be in the upper teens. We continue to make that expectation. It's what we are going to continue with. Erik, I think I heard you start to say deferred revenue. That accounts for the bulk of what has been the difference in the growth rates and coming down from last year to this year, and I'll let Jim add a bit of color on to that. \nJames Kavanaugh: Yes, Erik, thanks. Just building on what Arvind said, 17% growth overall, taking share both in our core RHEL but also in our hybrid cloud platform-centric foundation, Red Hat OpenShift. By the way, Red Hat OpenShift, 4.5x now the revenue pre-acquisition. We had very strong bookings overall in Red Hat here in the quarter. Large deals were up 50%. Red Hat OpenShift bookings were up over 50%, which positions us very well with our backlog and a strong NRR. So we feel pretty good about our Red Hat portfolio overall. \n Arvind indicated, our model is high teens. We delivered on that in the quarter. And by the way, the deferred revenue, we talked about entering January this year that, that was going to lessen throughout the year. And we're pretty much through that. I mean there's some small round-up here in the third quarter, but that's pretty much behind us. And remember, we're 3 years into this acquisition right now. and we couldn't be more pleased as we move forward. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess my question is really on the free cash flow guide. One of the things that always comes up there -- I'm just going to look at the numbers right there. Revenue seems to be doing better than what most folks thought it was 90 days ago, I think at the start of the year event. But the free cash flow number, I think, it is $10 billion at this point, it was $10 billion to $10.5 billion initially. Maybe just talk on what are the puts and takes you see on free cash flow because that would be helpful to kind of understand? And then maybe just related to that, you've been very explicit on the FX headwinds on your top line. I'm assuming given how volatile this movement was, there might be an impact to your EPS and free cash flow. So maybe you can just flush out what's the picture on free cash flow and how is the FX impacting being below the top line? That would be helpful. \nJames Kavanaugh: Yes, Amit, thank you very much. So let's take a moment to go through this because I think it's very important when you look at our 2 key measures of success. You talked about it. Revenue growth Arvind's put in place to run this company and free cash flow growth. \n We started out the year guiding at $10 billion to $10.5 billion. And now coming through the first half, we have now moved it to the low end of that guidance at about $10 billion. \n Before I get into the puts and takes at the heart of your question, let's take a step back and put this into perspective. That $10 billion of free cash flow is growing $3.5 billion year-to-year, and it's even growing north of $2 billion against our 2021 IBM post-separation baseline that we gave to all of our investors. Remember, we're very transparent on the revenue growth of the Kyndryl contribution, and we have given each of you the pro forma baseline. But on either case, that is very strong free cash flow growth overall. \n There's 2 pieces that I talked about in the summary of the prepared remarks. Number one, given the unfortunate humanitarian crisis in the war in Russia, we made the right decision to exit that business here in the second quarter. And that was a very highly profitable business for us, and that's going to cost a couple -- $100 million worth of free cash flow and profit, by the way, in 2022. The second is what's been happening with the rate and pace of the U.S. dollar appreciation. And that right now, we are not immune to that as we move forward. \n But let me talk a little bit about the go-forward free cash flow. We achieved $3.3 billion through the first half. That is actually slightly above our historical attainment over the last 5 years. And when we look at the second half, we see continued revenue growth. We see continued operating leverage out of our business. We've had good performance on our working capital management here through the first half. And given the volume dynamics and now our mainframe cycle, which we got off to a good start, should provide leverage. And then as I talked about in January, we do have a modest cash tax headwind -- or excuse me, tailwind for the year. So that kind of wraps up free cash flow overall. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. \nToni Sacconaghi: I was wondering if you could just comment on whether you still expect $35 billion in free cash through 2024 and what the bridge for that is? And then you mentioned that revenue sequentially would be a little lighter than usual in Q3 because of the mainframe. I think you're typically down about $850 million. The mainframe is like $500 million to $700 million a quarter. So maybe it's a $100 million headwind. So is that sort of the dimension that you're thinking about for Q3? Or are there other factors at work? \nArvind Krishna: Toni, let me start by first addressing the $35 billion free cash flow question, and then I'll hand it to Jim. We are absolutely committed to our $35 billion total free cash flow cumulative over '22 through '24. And we still see very good signs, and we have confidence in delivering that number. And so with that, you said the bridge to that and then the 2Q to 3Q dynamics, I'll hand it to Jim for those. \nJames Kavanaugh: Yes. Thanks, Toni. If you go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, we typically -- I think the number is actually about $1 billion sequentially in revenue, Toni, overall. But we've actually given pretty explicit guidance on third quarter. We said that we were going to be all in high single digit at constant currency here in the second quarter. So let me address your question from that dynamic because we gave -- we've given that explicit quarter-to-quarter and what's going to happen to constant currency total revenue. \n So if you look at second quarter, we delivered mid-teens. By the way, I wouldn't make the point -- that is the strongest constant currency growth that we've had in 20 years in this company, well above our mid-single-digit model and an acceleration from second quarter. By the way, acceleration in revenue growth, acceleration in operating profit margin of 420 basis points and acceleration in free cash flow. But if you look at constant currency, we're going from mid-teens in second quarter to high single digit. Let me call that 9% to 10%. That's about 6 points worth of what I'll call \"deceleration.\" Two points right off the bat is coming from our health care software asset divestiture. We closed that at the end of June. \n That's about $200 million a quarter. That's 2 points of the 6. The remaining 4 points is the dynamic of us for the first time in 20 years coming out with a new mainframe cycle in a highly-seasonal transactional quarter of second quarter. We did extremely well. Remember, 90 days ago, we took up our second quarter revenue guidance by $200 million versus the normal seasonality. We actually beat that in the second quarter. \n Now when you look at second half and get into third quarter, I think it's imprudent in this environment for us only to guide at what a normal cycle would be. And given the normal cycle, that's going to cost us about 4 points in a 2Q to 3Q given the announcement in the second quarter. And I'll wrap it up just saying that, Toni, I talked about upfront that we still see 40% to 60% SKU in our operating profit for the year. That hasn't changed since January. This is really a dynamic between the third quarter and the fourth quarter now given how we announced the new Z cycle, which we're very excited about here in the second half. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. \nWamsi Mohan: Arvind, I know you left your constant currency guide unchanged for the year, but it would be helpful to get some color maybe on what is tracking a bit better or worse versus your expectations. And if I could, Jim, can you help sort through the PTI change year-over-year in the second half of the year? It seems like you had significant improvement in PTI, 400-plus basis points in the second quarter. You're guiding to about 200 basis points in the third quarter. Does it mean that there is a catch-up of sort of PTI in the fourth quarter? Or is this -- and how much of that is FX versus mainframe timing-related? Because you alluded to both of those when you were talking about the revenue impact. \nArvind Krishna: Great. So Wamsi, let me address the first part of your question. We had very balanced performance in constant currency across geographies and actually across the different businesses. Now because of currency, the actual performance will be different in different geographies, but double-digit performance in the Americas, in Europe as well as in Asia Pacific. \n Jim laid out the numbers on the different business performances. He talked about at constant currency, 12% in software, 18% in consulting, 19% in infrastructure. Those are really strong performances, I believe. As we go forward, you should expect to see us maintain, and we said, we talked about we'll remain in the mid-single digits on software. We will get towards the low end of double digits in consulting, which is actually up from our previous high single-digit margin, and infrastructure will benefit from the Z cycle. So all in, that's very balanced across the portfolio and across the geographies, and that then contributes towards our confidence in the revenue profile for the rest of the year. \nJames Kavanaugh: Yes, Wamsi, thanks for the question. Let me give you a step back from an overall perspective, and then I'll come into the third quarter. We maintained the guidance to your question about high single-digit -- or excuse me, high end of our mid-single-digit revenue growth before the incremental Kyndryl contribution for the year. Arvind just went through the portfolio dynamics of that. \n By the way, the currency change that now we expect about 6 points impact beyond that constant currency strong performance, that went up from about 3 to 4 points 90 days ago. So that's about $1.5 billion. I've seen some people quoting $3.5 billion. It's about $1.5 billion overall change from what we said here in April. But with that revenue growth, we expect about $10 billion of free cash flow and operating profit margins up a strong 350 basis points year-over-year. \n When you look at that by segment, we really haven't changed our software segment. We feel pretty comfortable and confident in our first half trajectory that we're still going to grow mid-single digit overall in software, operating margins approaching mid-20s. Remember, that's 5 to 6 points of an operating margin. Infrastructure segment, we still think, given the product cycle dynamics, it will be well in excess of its model and have operating margins around mid- to high teens. And then consulting, we see strong demand in consulting. We took up our model on revenue growth 90 days ago, and now that's low double digit. And our margin now, we took down to [ $9 billion ] to [ $10 billion ]. That's the one change that's happening. \n And what we're seeing is it's taking longer for our price optimization to play through to our margin. We still expect margin increase year-over-year for the full year between that [ $9 billion ] and [ $10 billion ] absolute PTI. And that will actually be -- as we wrap on easier comparison in the second half, that will be some nice margin accretion here in our consulting business in the second half overall. \n Now third quarter, similar to how I answered Toni's question on revenue growth overall, our operating margins are typically flat quarter-to-quarter. When you look at the dynamics of mainframe coming out for the first time in 20 years in a highly-seasonal transactional quarter and you look at then a prudent guidance on the third quarter, that is about a 4-point margin impact. And by the way, our third quarter, we guided to be up 2. So when you look at the dynamics, it's entirely even more so driven by the mainframe dynamics. And to your question, Wamsi, that comes back to us here in the fourth quarter, so we'll just have a very different SKU given the new introduction in the second quarter. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. \nBrian Essex: Jim, I was wondering if you could -- I appreciate the comments on the consulting side of the business. I was wondering if you could dig in a little bit there. I appreciate kind of the pricing dynamics you discussed. But I think if we look at this from both the demand side and the supply side, could you share any thoughts on what you're seeing if there's -- if anything is changing there? So from the supply side, hiring, attrition, wage inflation changing or stabilizing. On demand side, I noticed that it's great to see the improvement in constant currency growth sequentially. Nice to see the acceleration, but it looks like business transformation moderated a little bit while we have improvement in technology consulting and application operations. So maybe if we could walk through supply dynamics and the demand dynamics to see what's changing within that business and what's driving your confidence in the performance for the rest of the year? \nJames Kavanaugh: Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Great question. So let's take a minute here to go through this, right? We continue -- I'm going to start with the demand side of the equation because in a human capital-based business, the way we manage this is our source of cost, our value ROI indicators, the human capital to go drive that demand and capture it. So we continue to see a strong demand profile, and we're capturing it by raising our guidance here and seeing the accelerated consulting performance in the quarter, up 18%, by the way, on a plus 8% last year overall. So I think that's driven by what Arvind has been talking about, and that is the value of technology being a sustainable competitive advantage in this environment as clients in every industry are moving and accelerating their digital transformation and journey in the cloud. \n Consulting is also a very integral part to our hybrid cloud platform thesis. I've talked every quarter about being the tip of the spirit to drive the scale adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and pull through IBM's technology overall. So we saw this. If you remember, dial back a year ago, we were entering second half '21 in a very different dynamic coming off of the pandemic. And I think Arvind was very explicit about the demand indicators that we saw that we were going to take a conscious strategy to now I'm on your supply side to invest in skills and capabilities, in ecosystem expansion and in acquisitions because we saw the robust demand growth that was going to be out there. \n And I think we've been capitalizing on that growing consistent double digit. And by the way, another solid signings quarter with the trailing 12-month book-to-bill north of 1.1, we feel pretty good even as we enter the second half. But you take that conscious strategy of driving incremental skill capability capacity on the supply side and then you couple that with a highly-inflationary environment that started to play out in the second half, and you see that, that's been impacting our gross profit margins. \n And we talked about as we came into 2022 that we were going to go take the appropriate actions around our price optimization but that, that would take time to get rolled through our P&L, and that's what we kind of expect in the second half of this year. So when we look at all in, demand still see solid. The supply side of the equation, we've been optimized with a very disciplined, strategic investment process. And when we look at second half, we are looking at: one, easier comps; two, scaling the acquisitive accretion of our acquisitions, where actually we saw some good green shoots here in the second quarter; three, getting effective increase in utilization of our capacity; and four, price optimization continue to play through. So we saw nice improvement in our price margins that will play out in the second half as we move forward. So hopefully, that gets you a little perspective. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. \nKyle McNealy: So the strengthening dollar generally comes with a translation impact but also some demand destruction in nondollar-denominated markets. So are you able to size how much that demand-related impact might be, which would actually make your reiterated guidance for the high end of your mid-single-digit range for the full year for the core look even a bit better? Also connected to that, what is your sense if you have some perspective on how well international customers are positioned to be able to absorb the currency fluctuations? \nJames Kavanaugh: Okay, Kyle. Thank you. I'll take this, Arvind. Let me spend a few minutes on currency since it seems to be a theme here across the questions and really how we manage it within our business and how it impacts our business model. So while we have a robust hedging program, as I indicated earlier, we're not immune over the long term, the currency impacts, especially when currencies move at the rate, breadth and magnitude that we've seen. \n Let me give you some stats as we've been going through here in the month of June and the early part of July. One, the U.S. dollar index is up 13% year-to-date, a 20-year high against the euro, 25-year high against the yen. The velocity of the strengthening is the sharpest that we've seen in over a decade. And it's been a broad-based dollar story, as you all know. All the currencies we hedge, over half of them are down double digits against the U.S. dollar this year. So it's kind of, I would say, \"unprecedented\" in what we've seen in the rate, the breadth of magnitude. \n Now to your question, Kyle. Our business profile, we operate in 170 countries around the world. That's in excess of over 100 currencies. The strong dollar definitely has an impact. And to your point, from an absolute revenue profile, I would agree with you completely. It even makes our constant currency revenue growth guidance even stronger in us capturing what's happening in the marketplace with regards to that acceleration of digitization and transformation and journey to cloud. \n But our robust hedging program, there's 2 important points I'd like to make. Number one, we don't hedge 100 currencies. One, it's not economically viable; and two, you can't hedge revenue per GAAP accounting. You can only hedge where you have cash proxies in countries. So we only hedge, give or take, about 35 currencies around the world out of the 100 plus that we're in. And also important, if not more important, we only hedge 12 months out. We don't do multiyear hedging in this business. We're not speculative. \n So when you look at the lasting relevance of a U.S. dollar appreciation, eventually, what hedging does is, it mitigates volatility in the near term. It does not eliminate currency. It allows you time to address your business model for price, for source, for labor pools and for cost structures. \n Now also important, and this is where you see the dynamics playing out in our business model. Currency impacts a human capital-based business, very different than a product-based business, and I've talked about this many times over the years. In a human capital-based business, if you think about it, a large portion of your cost structure is a natural hedge because it's in local currency. Very different in a product-based business where a large portion of your cost structure is U.S. dollar-denominated. So as the dollar at rate and pace and magnitude appreciates, it has a disproportional impact on our high-value, product-based businesses, read that, software and infrastructure. And you saw that play on the second quarter at the gross margin level. \n Remember, our hedges end up in expense. Gross margin, you see the revenue and the margin implications. So we understand how to manage currency. We have a robust hedging program in place. We've taken the appropriate cost structure and the appropriate pricing as we deal with that going forward, and you see all that taken into account in our guidance. \nOperator: Our next question will come from David Grossman with Stifel. \nDavid Grossman: Could you just remind us whether there are any expenses or stranded costs that remain in the 2022 P&L, that will diminish or go away in the next few years? You mentioned Russia had some losses. You mentioned the health care software divestiture. I don't know if there are any more. And perhaps beyond that, could you weave that dynamic into how it impacts free cash flow growth in the next year or 2, given your 2024 target really implies a fairly meaningful increase in free cash conversion over the next 2 years? \nJames Kavanaugh: Yes, David, thank you very much for the question. At its core, we actually took some conscious strategy back in fourth quarter '20, if you remember. At the time, we announced the intent to spin off Kyndryl that we were going to try to get out in front of stranded costs. And as you see now, we've executed on additional portfolio actions with the divestiture and closure of our health care software assets across the board. \n If you look at 2022, there's about $500 million to $600 million, $700 million, give or take, in that range around structural action cash charges that will still impact us. And by the way, that's embedded in our about $10 billion overall. So now when you think to the core of your question about how that [ then ] plays out for '23 and '24, that actually turns into tailwinds in '23 and '24 because we're depressed in our free cash flow guidance. \n And again, I'll remind you, that's up $3.5 billion year-to-year and up over $2 billion against our post-separation baseline. That depresses 2022's free cash flow. And we get that return, not only on the cash charges that we won't have in 2023, but also on the incremental ROI of getting rid of that stranded cost as we move forward. So both pieces, it kind of gives you a double benefit as we move forward. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Keith Bachman with BMO. \nKeith Bachman: Arvind, I wanted to direct it to you, if I could. I? wanted to see if you could look out over the horizon a little bit longer. Some of the software companies have talked about some of the pipelines in a deep sales cycle are starting to extend and I just wanted to see if you're seeing any economic impact. And then more specifically, I wanted to see if you could comment, historically, consulting has been highly correlated to economic cycles. And this is going back last 15, 20 years. And I just wanted to see as we're heading into late '22 and more importantly '23, how do you think the consulting business is prepared for some potential economic downturns? Or just more broadly, how do you think about the growth potential there? \n And Jim, if I could just sneak in one thing for you real quick, if you could just talk about what the M&A contribution is this year? You mentioned some recent deals. Just if you could provide an update, that would be great. \nArvind Krishna: Okay. So Keith, a lot to unpack in that question. If I look at our pipelines, our pipelines are remaining pretty healthy. So I would tell you that right now, what we are seeing is that the second half at this point, looks pretty consistent to the first half. When we look at our pipelines, whether it's in Red Hat or mainframe software or Automation, Data & AI, Security and by geography. \n So this is a little bit different, which is why you've heard me often say I'm a bit more optimistic than many of my peers, both within the industry and across the board because we see that technology, and Jim has also said this as of I, is deflationary. So in an inflationary environment when clients take our technology, deploy it, leverage our consulting. It acts as a counterbalance to all of the inflation and all of the labor demographics that people are facing all over the globe. So that is the reason on software. \n Second, on consulting correlated to the economic cycle, and maybe we see much less of that this time around because of the nature of our consulting. If you look at it, a lot of our consulting is around deploying back-office applications, critical applications, supply chain resilience, worrying about cash conversion, worrying about optimization of our -- of the costs within our clients. Those tend to get more attention actually in, I'll call it, at least a slight down cycle. They're not. \n Third, Look, consulting is very labor-based. Jim talked a lot about the demand and the supply. But to be completely clear, in a business where you do hire tens of thousands of people because of the scale of it, you do churn in the neighborhood of tens of thousands each year. That gives you an automatic way to hit a pause in some of the profit controls because if you don't see the demand coming, you're going to slow down your supply side. And it -- you get kind of at least a 10% to 20% impact that you can pretty quickly control, not in a given month, but certainly within a half year or thereabouts. \n On M&A, actually, I'll say it before Jim will. We have said that our model is about 1 point to 1.5 points each year based on M&A. And if you look at last year, that was pretty consistent. If you look at this year, look, the year is not over, but you should expect it to stay in that range. And it's a mix between consulting acquisitions and software acquisitions, and the multiples that we've been getting them at still imply that range. So I think we'll give you that answer, and we expect it to stay there. \n So let me wrap up the call. So let me just say, we are very pleased with our solid first half performance. As we look to the second half, we are going to focus on the execution of our strategy, delivering sustained revenue and free cash flow growth. And I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. \nPatricia Murphy: [ Kayla ], let me turn it back to you to wrap up the call. \nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. In the second quarter, we drove solid results reflecting the investments and changes we have been making to execute our strategy. With this performance, we continue to deliver on our model of mid-single-digit revenue growth. \n Technology plays an important role in today's business environment. In fact, nearly every client I speak to believes that technology serves as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It serves as both a deflationary force and a force multiplier and is especially critical as clients face challenges on multiple fronts from supply chain bottlenecks to demographic shifts. \n Given its ability to boost innovation, productivity, resilience and help organizations scale, IT has become a high priority in our company's budget. As such, there is every reason to believe technology spending in the B2B space will continue to surpass GDP growth. \n With this demand backdrop, we are executing our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We have made changes to our portfolio and focused investments in our offerings, technical talent, our ecosystem and go-to-market model. \n Demand for our solutions remains strong. We continue to have double-digit performance in IBM Consulting, broad-based trend in software. And with the z16 platform launch, our infrastructure business had a good quarter. By integrating technology and expertise from IBM and our partners, our clients will continue to see our hybrid cloud and AI solutions as a crucial source of business opportunity and growth. \n Let me now delve a little bit deeper into the progress and the execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid cloud is about offering clients a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private clouds and on-premise properties, all the way to the edge. Our platform based on Red Hat allows our clients to consume powerful software capabilities driven by open source innovation. Our software has been optimized to run on that platform and includes advanced data and AI, automation and the security capabilities our clients need. Our global team of consultants offers deep business expertise and cocreates with clients to accelerate their digital transformation journeys. Our infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. \n As a testament to the success of our strategy, we continue to increase adoption of our platform with over 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including more than 250 added in this past quarter alone. Apart from working with a greater number of clients, those who adopt our platform tend to consume more of our solutions across software, consulting and infrastructure, expanding our footprint within those clients. Recently, clients such as [ P&C ], Barclays and Citi have chosen our hybrid cloud capabilities to unlock more business value and meet rapidly changing client demands. \n Organizations everywhere are also under intense pressure to fast track their digital transformation and harness the power of the data. With the world now creating 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day, artificial intelligence, or AI, is the only way to process this enormous amount of data from hybrid cloud environments all the way to the edge. That is why AI adoption is steadily on the rise. \n According to a new study released by IBM last quarter, 35% of companies are now using some form of AI in their business. Many of those companies are using AI and automation to address demographic shifts and move their employees to higher value work. This is one of the many reasons we are investing heavily in both AI and automation. These investments are paying off. \n In addition to the strong revenue performance in automation and data and AI software, we recently received 2 important recognitions. We were named as a leader in the latest Gartner Magic Quadrant for APM and Observability and in The Forrester Data Fabric Wave for our Cloud Pak for data. \n Over the last several quarters, I've highlighted the importance of the growing ecosystem of partners to our platform-centric strategy with leading firms like SAP, Salesforce, Adobe, Oracle, Microsoft and AWS. This quarter, we continue to expand and extend our partnerships. I'll expand on just 2. \n We announced a strategic collaboration agreement with AWS to offer a broad array of our software catalog on AWS. This includes capabilities that span Automation, Data & AI, Security and Sustainability. Second, with Tech Mahindra, we launched synergy lounges to empower businesses with the innovation technologies and services for key industries such as telecommunications, manufacturing, banking, health care, energy and utilities. The first synergy lounge was established in Bengaluru with a focus on edge, 5G and software-defined networking solutions with hybrid cloud. This will be followed by the opening of 3 more centers in London, Seattle and Melbourne. \n Clients aren't just simply buying software or hardware. They're entering a relationship with the company that's going to help them navigate the future of technology. This is why innovation and our ability to invent what's next remains so important. \n Quantum is a great example of our commitment to advance the future of technology. Building on our progress of 127 qubit Quantum computer currently in our cloud, we have committed to demonstrate the first 400-plus qubit system before year-end. This will help us move forward towards our road map to deliver 1,000-plus qubit system next year and a 4,000-plus qubit system in 2025. \n One of the implications of quantum computing will be the need to change how information is encrypted. We are proud that technology developed by IBM and our collaborators has been selected by NIST as the basis of the next generation of quantum-safe encryption protocols. \n In another example of innovation, our new z16 system became generally available in the second quarter. The z16 is designed for cloud native development; server security resilience; quantum-safe encryption; and includes an on-chip accelerator, which allows clients to reduce fraud within real-time transactions. \n Given the importance of cybersecurity, in this past quarter, we also acquired Randori, a leading attack surface management and offensive cybersecurity provider. This builds on the recent acquisition of ReaQta and the launch of QRadar XDR. It's one of 2 acquisitions in the second quarter and over 25% in the last 2 years. \n Another major focus area across all stakeholders is ESG, which isn't just a regulatory requirement or about being a good corporate citizen. It's also a business opportunity. A poll conducted by the IBM Institute for Business Value shows that 50% of CEOs see sustainability as one of their highest priorities, and over 80% of CEOs believe their company's sustainability investments will improve business results and accelerate growth. To accomplish this, companies need to leverage AI and to turn the mountains of data they collect into sustainable action. \n SL Green Realty Corporation, Manhattan's largest office landlord, is a recent example. They are using Envizi, an IBM solution to manage their easy indicators across their extensive real estate operations, including energy use, carbon emissions and environmental and social responsibility metrics. \n Let me wrap up by saying that given the strength of our portfolio, the need for our technology and expertise with the benefits we're yielding from any actions, we remain confident in our ability to deliver revenue in 2022 at the high end of our mid-single-digit model. \n Now let me hand it over to Jim, who will give you more detail on our second quarter performance and add color on our expectations for the balance of the year. Thank you, Erik, for the question. Let me start off by just -- we feel very good about the Red Hat business, and we see very strong demand continuing. That said, we had said late last year that we expect growth in Red Hat to be in the upper teens. We continue to make that expectation. It's what we are going to continue with. Erik, I think I heard you start to say deferred revenue. That accounts for the bulk of what has been the difference in the growth rates and coming down from last year to this year, and I'll let Jim add a bit of color on to that. Toni, let me start by first addressing the $35 billion free cash flow question, and then I'll hand it to Jim. We are absolutely committed to our $35 billion total free cash flow cumulative over '22 through '24. And we still see very good signs, and we have confidence in delivering that number. And so with that, you said the bridge to that and then the 2Q to 3Q dynamics, I'll hand it to Jim for those. Great. So Wamsi, let me address the first part of your question. We had very balanced performance in constant currency across geographies and actually across the different businesses. Now because of currency, the actual performance will be different in different geographies, but double-digit performance in the Americas, in Europe as well as in Asia Pacific. \n Jim laid out the numbers on the different business performances. He talked about at constant currency, 12% in software, 18% in consulting, 19% in infrastructure. Those are really strong performances, I believe. As we go forward, you should expect to see us maintain, and we said, we talked about we'll remain in the mid-single digits on software. We will get towards the low end of double digits in consulting, which is actually up from our previous high single-digit margin, and infrastructure will benefit from the Z cycle. So all in, that's very balanced across the portfolio and across the geographies, and that then contributes towards our confidence in the revenue profile for the rest of the year. Okay. So Keith, a lot to unpack in that question. If I look at our pipelines, our pipelines are remaining pretty healthy. So I would tell you that right now, what we are seeing is that the second half at this point, looks pretty consistent to the first half. When we look at our pipelines, whether it's in Red Hat or mainframe software or Automation, Data & AI, Security and by geography. \n So this is a little bit different, which is why you've heard me often say I'm a bit more optimistic than many of my peers, both within the industry and across the board because we see that technology, and Jim has also said this as of I, is deflationary.

And it -- you get kind of at least a 10% to 20% impact that you can pretty quickly control, not in a given month, but certainly within a half year or thereabouts. \n On M&A, actually, I'll say it before Jim will. We have said that our model is about 1 point to 1.5 points each year based on M&A. And if you look at last year, that was pretty consistent. If you look at this year, look, the year is not over, but you should expect it to stay in that range.

And I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon."

            "name": "James Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights. In the second quarter, we delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.5 billion of operating pretax income, which is a margin of 16.2%; and operating earnings per share of $2.31. In the first half of the year, we generated $3.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue was up 16%. This includes nearly 5 points of incremental revenue from Kyndryl. \n As always, we discussed revenue growth at constant currency. But given the focus on the sharply strengthening dollar, I'll mention that currency translation impacted our reported revenue by over 6 points of growth or $900 million. That's over $200 million more than the spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago. \n Today's IBM has a higher growth profile driven by our growth vectors of software and consulting. More than half of our annual revenue is recurring, with about 2/3 of that in high-value software. Software revenue this past quarter was up 12%; and Consulting, up 18%. Infrastructure performance, which reflects a good start to our z16 product cycle, was up 25%. Software and infrastructure each include about 7 points of growth from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl. \n These results reflect the investments we've been making in innovation, our ecosystem and talent, all aligned to our strategic areas of hybrid cloud and AI. We integrate consulting and technology to deliver these hybrid cloud and AI solutions. Our platform approach not only benefits our clients but also provides an attractive economic model for IBM and our partners with a multiple of software and consulting revenue generated for every dollar of platform revenue. Our hybrid cloud revenue from our full stack capabilities across software, consulting and infrastructure was up 19% over the last year. It has grown to $21.7 billion or 36% of our total revenue. \n Looking at our P&L metrics. Operating gross profit dollars were up driven by strong revenue performance in our high-value businesses. Our year-to-year gross margin decline reflects escalating labor and component costs. We're addressing this through pricing, though it takes some time to show up in our margin profile, especially in consulting. Our operating pretax income was up, and we expanded margin by 420 basis points. We had an operating tax rate of about 16.5%, which is up about 2 points versus last year, and our operating net income margin expanded 330 basis points. \n Let me comment on a few dynamics within our profit performance. Our pretax profit reflects the benefit from actions we've taken to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model as well as profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship post separation. \n Our profit this quarter also reflects recent portfolio actions. At the end of June, we closed on the divestiture of our health care software assets, generating a pretax gain of about $230 million in the period. Mitigating that benefit to our overall profit results, we took charges to address stranded costs associated with the divestiture and absorbed operating losses related to the health business, together, over $75 million. \n We also announced the orderly wind down of our Russian operations, resulting in incremental charges in the quarter. Together with the year-to-year loss business due to the wind down, Russia impacted our profit results by another roughly $100 million. \n I also want to comment on the impact of currency. I mentioned that over the last 90 days, we've dealt with a sharply strengthening dollar. We execute hedge programs that cover the majority but not all of the currency exposure. The combination of the rate and velocity of movement this quarter and the fact that we don't hedge 100% results in a currency impact to our profit and cash flow. \n Turning to free cash flow. We generated over $2 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion for the first half with good working capital performance. This first half free cash flow is about 33% of our full year expected range, consistent with the average of the last few years. I'll remind you the $1 billion plus of proceeds from the health divestiture is reflected in cash from investing activities versus in our free cash flow. \n In terms of uses of cash for the first half, we invested nearly $1 billion in acquisitions with 5 closed this year, and we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. This results in a June cash position of nearly $8 billion, which is up slightly from year-end. And our debt of just over $50 billion is down about $1.5 billion over the same period. \n Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 12%. This includes about 7 points from the Kyndryl software content. Growth was driven by our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities. Hybrid cloud revenue for the segment now represents $9 billion over the last year, up 23%. \n Software subscription and support renewal rates were up again this quarter. This contributes to our solid and growing recurring revenue base, which represents about 80% of software. From a revenue category perspective, our software growth vector of Hybrid Platform & Solutions grew 9%. This includes about 1.5 points benefit from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. \n We again drove pervasive growth across Red Hat, Automation, Data & AI and Security. Red Hat revenue all in grew 17%. Revenue growth was fueled by new adoption and expansion of RHEL and OpenShift as both solutions continue to take share. These key offerings address hybrid cloud requirements in industries like financial services, public sector and telecommunications, across environments and out to the edge. \n Automation revenue was up 8%. Solid performance in both AI ops and management and integration demonstrates the importance of automation in the IT journeys of our clients. We had strength in offerings like Turbonomic and Instana for observability; Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps; and our modern integration platform, Cloud Pak for Integration. \n Data & AI revenue grew 4%. This growth was led by demand for data fabric, data management and asset and supply chain management solutions. We also just expanded our Data Fabric portfolio with the acquisition of Databand.ai, which helps organizations with data observability. \n Security revenue was up 5% with growth in threat management and identity as enterprises continue to adopt a Zero Trust security strategy and implement additional identity controls. We're continuing to invest in our security capabilities, having completed 2 acquisitions in the threat management space over the last few quarters. \n Across the 4 Hybrid Platform & Solution business areas, our annual recurring revenue, or ARR, is nearly $12.9 billion, up 8%. \n Turning to our software value vector, transaction processing, revenue grew 19%, including 22 points from the Kyndryl content. We continue to have strong renewal rates for this mission-critical software and performed in line with our expectations this quarter. \n Looking at software profit. We delivered operating leverage given the solid revenue growth and new Kyndryl commercial relationship. Our pretax margin was up 4 points and keeps us on track for a full year software margin in the mid-20s. \n Moving on to Consulting. We again saw pervasive growth with double-digit revenue growth across all business lines and geographies. Revenue was up 18% compared to 8% growth a year ago. We maintained a solid book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 on a trailing 12-month basis as clients are choosing to co-create with IBM, trusting our deep industry expertise. \n The expansion of our skills, capabilities and ecosystems are enabling us to capture demand as we drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and help clients with their digital transformations. Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% over the last year to $8.6 billion. Momentum behind our Red Hat practice remains strong. We nearly doubled our Red Hat consulting revenue in the quarter and continued solid Red Hat bookings, which now exceeds $6 billion inception to date. \n Our strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships continue to grow solid double digits, led by Azure, AWS and SAP and Salesforce. \n Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation grew 16%. Its clients look to IBM to help them transform critical workflows at scale. Growth in business transformation was pervasive and led by our offerings focused on customer experience transformation, data transformation and our SAP practices. \n In technology consulting, where we architect and implement clients cloud platforms and strategies, revenue was up 23%. Cloud modernization and cloud application development led a significant portion of the growth, with on-prem modernization also contributing to the strong revenue performance in the quarter. \n Application operations revenue grew 17%. Growth was solid across our cloud offerings, mitigated by declines in the on-prem space. In this business, we are optimizing the management of applications and providing cloud platform services required to run our clients' hybrid cloud environments. \n Moving to consulting profit. Our pretax margin expanded 1 point as we deliver operating leverage and benefit from IBM's more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting margins reflect the significant investments we have been making to capture demand and fuel our revenue growth. We continue to invest in our partner ecosystem, scale acquisitions and add skills. \n Consulting, which makes up well over half of IBM's workforce, is most impacted by the inflationary labor market and increasing labor cost as we bring and increase capacity. We are starting to capture the reality of these higher costs in our pricing. But given the time from contract signing to revenue realization, it's taking some time to see it in our margins. \n Turning to the Infrastructure segment. Revenue was up 25%, including about 7 points from the incremental Kyndryl content. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue grew 41%. And infrastructure support revenue grew 5%, including about 7 and 8 points of Kyndryl benefit, respectively. \n Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue was up 77%. This reflects solid execution around our z16 program, building on the momentum from z15. As Arvind mentioned, z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilient security and cloud native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. We are seeing growth in new workloads like Linux and demand for AI capabilities like real-time fraud detection, leveraging the on-chip AI accelerator. Clients are investing in zSystems platform as an essential part of their hybrid cloud infrastructure. \n Distributed infrastructure revenue grew 17% this quarter. This growth was led by storage, driven by both high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and distributed storage. We also had good performance in high-end Power10. Just last week, we announced the expansion of our Power10 server family as we deliver flexible and secure infrastructure for hybrid cloud environments. \n Looking at infrastructure profit, pretax margin was up 4 points year-to-year, reflecting mix benefits from the growth in zSystems, mitigated by the impact of increased component cost and supplier premiums. \n Now let me take it back up to the IBM level. We've taken actions and made investments over the last couple of years to execute a platform-centric hybrid cloud and AI strategy. IBM is now a more focused, faster-growing and higher value company. And while there is always more work to do, we are confident in our ability to deliver sustainable growth. \n Our first half results were solid. We continue to see constant currency revenue growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model for the full year. And on top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth from the Kyndryl sales spread over the first 3 quarters. \n I mentioned the impact of currency to our 2Q results. With the significant movement of the U.S. dollar as compared to nearly every currency, at mid-July spot rates, currency translation will now be about a 6-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. That's a degradation of about $1.5 billion from April's rates with most of that incremental impact still ahead of us in the second half. \n Currency is one unique issue we're dealing with. The other is the impact of exiting our Russia operation. Together, these are putting some pressure on our near-term results, and we now expect free cash flow of about $10 billion for the year. These are exogenous issues. Importantly, we feel good about the underlying fundamentals of our business. You see this in our segment expectations. Halfway through the year, there's no change to our full year view of software. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model range, plus 5 to 6 points from sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for 2022. \n Our IBM consulting revenue growth has been strong, and we continue to expect low double-digit revenue growth rate for the year, which is above our model. With continued investment in skills and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a consulting pretax margin of 9% to 10%, which is up over 1 point year-to-year. This reflects improving margin performance in the second half as we increase utilization of the resources we've added and price realization starts to flow to revenue. \n Our infrastructure revenue in any period reflects product cycle dynamics. We had a very strong launch of our z16 platform in the second quarter. This will drive infrastructure revenue performance above the model level for the year. On top of that, we're planning for about 5 to 6 points of revenue growth from the sales to Kyndryl in 2022. Despite some of the pressures from component cost increases and supplier premiums, we continue to see mid- to high-teens pretax margin for infrastructure for the full year. \n These segment revenue and margin dynamics yield about a 3.5 point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax margin for the full year. And we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth. You'll recall that back in January, we expected a 40-60 first half/second half profit SKU. Now after a solid start to the year, our view hasn't changed, and we still see 60% of the full year profit in the second half. \n Looking at the third quarter, we expect all in constant currency revenue growth in the high single-digit range and about a 2-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin. I want to mention 2 specific items on the third quarter. First, at current spot rates, currency translation has increased to about an 8-point headwind to revenue growth, impacting our reported revenue, profit and cash. Second, we haven't had a zSystems product introduction in our large transactional second quarter in about 20 years. This unique timing, coupled with the strong start to the cycle, will result in a larger second to third quarter impact than typical seasonality. So to be clear, we expect a strong year-to-year growth in zSystems. \n In closing, these are interesting times, and we see technology as a way to help our enterprise clients capture today's opportunities and navigate challenges. We feel good about the strategy we are executing and the fundamentals of our business. \n Patricia, now let's go on to the Q&A. Yes, Erik, thanks. Just building on what Arvind said, 17% growth overall, taking share both in our core RHEL but also in our hybrid cloud platform-centric foundation, Red Hat OpenShift. By the way, Red Hat OpenShift, 4.5x now the revenue pre-acquisition. We had very strong bookings overall in Red Hat here in the quarter. Large deals were up 50%. Red Hat OpenShift bookings were up over 50%, which positions us very well with our backlog and a strong NRR. So we feel pretty good about our Red Hat portfolio overall. \n Arvind indicated, our model is high teens. We delivered on that in the quarter. And by the way, the deferred revenue, we talked about entering January this year that, that was going to lessen throughout the year. And we're pretty much through that. I mean there's some small round-up here in the third quarter, but that's pretty much behind us. And remember, we're 3 years into this acquisition right now. and we couldn't be more pleased as we move forward. Yes, Amit, thank you very much. So let's take a moment to go through this because I think it's very important when you look at our 2 key measures of success. You talked about it. Revenue growth Arvind's put in place to run this company and free cash flow growth. \n We started out the year guiding at $10 billion to $10.5 billion. And now coming through the first half, we have now moved it to the low end of that guidance at about $10 billion. \n Before I get into the puts and takes at the heart of your question, let's take a step back and put this into perspective. That $10 billion of free cash flow is growing $3.5 billion year-to-year, and it's even growing north of $2 billion against our 2021 IBM post-separation baseline that we gave to all of our investors. Remember, we're very transparent on the revenue growth of the Kyndryl contribution, and we have given each of you the pro forma baseline. But on either case, that is very strong free cash flow growth overall. \n There's 2 pieces that I talked about in the summary of the prepared remarks. Number one, given the unfortunate humanitarian crisis in the war in Russia, we made the right decision to exit that business here in the second quarter. And that was a very highly profitable business for us, and that's going to cost a couple -- $100 million worth of free cash flow and profit, by the way, in 2022. The second is what's been happening with the rate and pace of the U.S. dollar appreciation. And that right now, we are not immune to that as we move forward. \n But let me talk a little bit about the go-forward free cash flow. We achieved $3.3 billion through the first half. That is actually slightly above our historical attainment over the last 5 years. And when we look at the second half, we see continued revenue growth. We see continued operating leverage out of our business. We've had good performance on our working capital management here through the first half. And given the volume dynamics and now our mainframe cycle, which we got off to a good start, should provide leverage. And then as I talked about in January, we do have a modest cash tax headwind -- or excuse me, tailwind for the year. So that kind of wraps up free cash flow overall. Yes. Thanks, Toni. If you go back to what I said in the prepared remarks, we typically -- I think the number is actually about $1 billion sequentially in revenue, Toni, overall. But we've actually given pretty explicit guidance on third quarter. We said that we were going to be all in high single digit at constant currency here in the second quarter. So let me address your question from that dynamic because we gave -- we've given that explicit quarter-to-quarter and what's going to happen to constant currency total revenue. \n So if you look at second quarter, we delivered mid-teens. By the way, I wouldn't make the point -- that is the strongest constant currency growth that we've had in 20 years in this company, well above our mid-single-digit model and an acceleration from second quarter. By the way, acceleration in revenue growth, acceleration in operating profit margin of 420 basis points and acceleration in free cash flow. But if you look at constant currency, we're going from mid-teens in second quarter to high single digit. Let me call that 9% to 10%. That's about 6 points worth of what I'll call \"deceleration.\" Two points right off the bat is coming from our health care software asset divestiture. We closed that at the end of June. \n That's about $200 million a quarter. That's 2 points of the 6. The remaining 4 points is the dynamic of us for the first time in 20 years coming out with a new mainframe cycle in a highly-seasonal transactional quarter of second quarter. We did extremely well. Remember, 90 days ago, we took up our second quarter revenue guidance by $200 million versus the normal seasonality. We actually beat that in the second quarter. \n Now when you look at second half and get into third quarter, I think it's imprudent in this environment for us only to guide at what a normal cycle would be. And given the normal cycle, that's going to cost us about 4 points in a 2Q to 3Q given the announcement in the second quarter. And I'll wrap it up just saying that, Toni, I talked about upfront that we still see 40% to 60% SKU in our operating profit for the year. That hasn't changed since January. This is really a dynamic between the third quarter and the fourth quarter now given how we announced the new Z cycle, which we're very excited about here in the second half. Yes, Wamsi, thanks for the question. Let me give you a step back from an overall perspective, and then I'll come into the third quarter. We maintained the guidance to your question about high single-digit -- or excuse me, high end of our mid-single-digit revenue growth before the incremental Kyndryl contribution for the year. Arvind just went through the portfolio dynamics of that. \n By the way, the currency change that now we expect about 6 points impact beyond that constant currency strong performance, that went up from about 3 to 4 points 90 days ago. So that's about $1.5 billion. I've seen some people quoting $3.5 billion. It's about $1.5 billion overall change from what we said here in April. But with that revenue growth, we expect about $10 billion of free cash flow and operating profit margins up a strong 350 basis points year-over-year. \n When you look at that by segment, we really haven't changed our software segment. We feel pretty comfortable and confident in our first half trajectory that we're still going to grow mid-single digit overall in software, operating margins approaching mid-20s. Remember, that's 5 to 6 points of an operating margin. Infrastructure segment, we still think, given the product cycle dynamics, it will be well in excess of its model and have operating margins around mid- to high teens. And then consulting, we see strong demand in consulting. We took up our model on revenue growth 90 days ago, and now that's low double digit. And our margin now, we took down to [ $9 billion ] to [ $10 billion ]. That's the one change that's happening. \n And what we're seeing is it's taking longer for our price optimization to play through to our margin. We still expect margin increase year-over-year for the full year between that [ $9 billion ] and [ $10 billion ] absolute PTI. And that will actually be -- as we wrap on easier comparison in the second half, that will be some nice margin accretion here in our consulting business in the second half overall. \n Now third quarter, similar to how I answered Toni's question on revenue growth overall, our operating margins are typically flat quarter-to-quarter. When you look at the dynamics of mainframe coming out for the first time in 20 years in a highly-seasonal transactional quarter and you look at then a prudent guidance on the third quarter, that is about a 4-point margin impact. And by the way, our third quarter, we guided to be up 2. So when you look at the dynamics, it's entirely even more so driven by the mainframe dynamics. And to your question, Wamsi, that comes back to us here in the fourth quarter, so we'll just have a very different SKU given the new introduction in the second quarter. Sure, Brian. Thanks for the question. Great question. So let's take a minute here to go through this, right? We continue -- I'm going to start with the demand side of the equation because in a human capital-based business, the way we manage this is our source of cost, our value ROI indicators, the human capital to go drive that demand and capture it. So we continue to see a strong demand profile, and we're capturing it by raising our guidance here and seeing the accelerated consulting performance in the quarter, up 18%, by the way, on a plus 8% last year overall. So I think that's driven by what Arvind has been talking about, and that is the value of technology being a sustainable competitive advantage in this environment as clients in every industry are moving and accelerating their digital transformation and journey in the cloud. \n Consulting is also a very integral part to our hybrid cloud platform thesis. I've talked every quarter about being the tip of the spirit to drive the scale adoption of our hybrid cloud platform and pull through IBM's technology overall. So we saw this. If you remember, dial back a year ago, we were entering second half '21 in a very different dynamic coming off of the pandemic. And I think Arvind was very explicit about the demand indicators that we saw that we were going to take a conscious strategy to now I'm on your supply side to invest in skills and capabilities, in ecosystem expansion and in acquisitions because we saw the robust demand growth that was going to be out there. \n And I think we've been capitalizing on that growing consistent double digit. And by the way, another solid signings quarter with the trailing 12-month book-to-bill north of 1.1, we feel pretty good even as we enter the second half. But you take that conscious strategy of driving incremental skill capability capacity on the supply side and then you couple that with a highly-inflationary environment that started to play out in the second half, and you see that, that's been impacting our gross profit margins. \n And we talked about as we came into 2022 that we were going to go take the appropriate actions around our price optimization but that, that would take time to get rolled through our P&L, and that's what we kind of expect in the second half of this year. So when we look at all in, demand still see solid. The supply side of the equation, we've been optimized with a very disciplined, strategic investment process. And when we look at second half, we are looking at: one, easier comps; two, scaling the acquisitive accretion of our acquisitions, where actually we saw some good green shoots here in the second quarter; three, getting effective increase in utilization of our capacity; and four, price optimization continue to play through. So we saw nice improvement in our price margins that will play out in the second half as we move forward. So hopefully, that gets you a little perspective. Okay, Kyle. Thank you. I'll take this, Arvind. Let me spend a few minutes on currency since it seems to be a theme here across the questions and really how we manage it within our business and how it impacts our business model. So while we have a robust hedging program, as I indicated earlier, we're not immune over the long term, the currency impacts, especially when currencies move at the rate, breadth and magnitude that we've seen. \n Let me give you some stats as we've been going through here in the month of June and the early part of July. One, the U.S. dollar index is up 13% year-to-date, a 20-year high against the euro, 25-year high against the yen. The velocity of the strengthening is the sharpest that we've seen in over a decade. And it's been a broad-based dollar story, as you all know. All the currencies we hedge, over half of them are down double digits against the U.S. dollar this year. So it's kind of, I would say, \"unprecedented\" in what we've seen in the rate, the breadth of magnitude. \n Now to your question, Kyle. Our business profile, we operate in 170 countries around the world. That's in excess of over 100 currencies. The strong dollar definitely has an impact. And to your point, from an absolute revenue profile, I would agree with you completely. It even makes our constant currency revenue growth guidance even stronger in us capturing what's happening in the marketplace with regards to that acceleration of digitization and transformation and journey to cloud. \n But our robust hedging program, there's 2 important points I'd like to make. Number one, we don't hedge 100 currencies. One, it's not economically viable; and two, you can't hedge revenue per GAAP accounting. You can only hedge where you have cash proxies in countries. So we only hedge, give or take, about 35 currencies around the world out of the 100 plus that we're in. And also important, if not more important, we only hedge 12 months out. We don't do multiyear hedging in this business. We're not speculative. \n So when you look at the lasting relevance of a U.S. dollar appreciation, eventually, what hedging does is, it mitigates volatility in the near term. It does not eliminate currency. It allows you time to address your business model for price, for source, for labor pools and for cost structures. \n Now also important, and this is where you see the dynamics playing out in our business model. Currency impacts a human capital-based business, very different than a product-based business, and I've talked about this many times over the years. In a human capital-based business, if you think about it, a large portion of your cost structure is a natural hedge because it's in local currency. Very different in a product-based business where a large portion of your cost structure is U.S. dollar-denominated. So as the dollar at rate and pace and magnitude appreciates, it has a disproportional impact on our high-value, product-based businesses, read that, software and infrastructure. And you saw that play on the second quarter at the gross margin level. \n Remember, our hedges end up in expense. Gross margin, you see the revenue and the margin implications. So we understand how to manage currency. We have a robust hedging program in place. We've taken the appropriate cost structure and the appropriate pricing as we deal with that going forward, and you see all that taken into account in our guidance. Yes, David, thank you very much for the question. At its core, we actually took some conscious strategy back in fourth quarter '20, if you remember. At the time, we announced the intent to spin off Kyndryl that we were going to try to get out in front of stranded costs. And as you see now, we've executed on additional portfolio actions with the divestiture and closure of our health care software assets across the board. \n If you look at 2022, there's about $500 million to $600 million, $700 million, give or take, in that range around structural action cash charges that will still impact us. And by the way, that's embedded in our about $10 billion overall. So now when you think to the core of your question about how that [ then ] plays out for '23 and '24, that actually turns into tailwinds in '23 and '24 because we're depressed in our free cash flow guidance. \n And again, I'll remind you, that's up $3.5 billion year-to-year and up over $2 billion against our post-separation baseline. That depresses 2022's free cash flow. And we get that return, not only on the cash charges that we won't have in 2023, but also on the incremental ROI of getting rid of that stranded cost as we move forward. So both pieces, it kind of gives you a double benefit as we move forward."

Our first quarter results reflect the changes we have made to position our business for the future. This solid start to the year reinforces our confidence in our strategy and we now see revenue growth for 2022 at the high end of our mid single-digit model. What we are hearing from clients is clear. Technology has become a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It is at the very center of how businesses scale and is no longer perceived primarily as a way to cut costs. This is especially true in our current environment. Harnessing the power of technology such as Hybrid Cloud and AI remains essential as our clients face a number of strategic challenges and opportunities, whether it\u2019s competing for talent, supply chain issues, inflation, cybersecurity or geopolitical instability. We continue to see a strong demand environment for both technology and consulting, as we help our clients respond to these issues. Over the last two years, we have been optimizing our portfolio, expanding our ecosystem, and simplifying our go-to-market to capture this demand. This quarter, we again had double-digit revenue growth in Consulting and Software growth reflects solid performance across the portfolio. Our Infrastructure business, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. Our revenue performance this quarter is a strong indication that our focus, our investments and our actions are paying off. Before we go further, let me say a few words about the war in Ukraine. We are first and foremost focused on the safety and security of our employees. IBM is providing help, including relocation assistance and financial support to IBMers in the region and matching donations from our employees around the world to non-profits. In terms of the business impact from Russia, Jim will quantify, but I will say the impact is measurable, but not large. Let me now turn to the progress we are making when it comes to our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid cloud is all about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private clouds and on-premise properties that our clients typically have. The platform we have built is open, secure, and flexible. At its core, it is based on Red Hat, which gives clients powerful software capabilities based on open-source innovation. Our software has been optimized for that platform and helps our clients supply AI, automation and security to make their business work better.  Our global team of consultants offers deep business expertise. They do this by co-creating with clients and finding ways to harness the power of technology to accelerate their digital transformation journey. Our Infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. This platform-centric strategy is producing solid results. We have more than 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including 200 added in the first quarter. This gives us two avenues of growth from the incremental number of clients, but more importantly, it allows us to expand our software, consulting and infrastructure footprint at these clients.  Clients such as Charles Schwab, Discover Financial, and the U.S. Department of Education have all recently chosen IBM\u2019s hybrid cloud capabilities to digitally transform and build new and differentiated experiences and services. Clients also turn to IBM\u2019s AI capabilities to move their employees to higher value tasks and improve their customer experiences. For instance, IBM is now working with McDonald\u2019s to pilot an automated drive-thru experience with Watson Orders. In addition, TD Securities is using IBM\u2019s AI-powered virtual assistant in support of their precious metals digital store. We were recently recognized in this area as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. These highlight our ability to drive innovation in natural language processing and bring these new capabilities to clients. An important element of our platform strategy is our partner ecosystem where we continue to gain momentum. We see this in IBM Consulting, where signings with our ecosystem partners were up more than 50% to $2 billion this quarter. In the first quarter, we continued to broaden our ecosystem. We announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with SAP, serving as SAP\u2019s RISE premium partner to help clients move workloads to the cloud. With Adobe, we announced a significant expansion of a partnership around the use of AI-powered weather data on the Adobe experience platform. We are collaborating with Worley and ABB to build a digitally-enabled solution that will help energy companies build and operate green hydrogen facilities more efficiently and at scale. We also signed an agreement to join the UAE\u2019s network of Industry 4.0 Champions, a major public/private partnership designed to accelerate the digital transformation of the country\u2019s industrial sector. Within IBM, we are making significant changes to the way we work to build a client-centric culture based on technical excellence. Our new client engagement model based on experiential selling, client engineering and co-creation is strongly resonating among clients. Over the last few quarters, sales productivity is rising, renewal rates are increasing and recurring revenue is growing. While we are focused on meeting the needs of clients today, we continue to shift to technologies of tomorrow. Most recently, we announced the IBM z16 platform in early April. z16 is designed for cloud-native development, cybersecurity resilience and includes an on-chip AI accelerator. This allows clients to reduce fraud within real-time transactions. The z16 exemplifies our ability to drive critical innovations to a platform that remains essential to the world\u2019s economy. At the same time, we are bullish on the immense potential that automation represents. We firmly believe that our AIOps capabilities are poised to seize this significant opportunity. In the last quarter, we announced a new AIOps solution in collaboration with Flexera that is designed to automate software license compliance. Quantum is another example of our commitment to advance the fundamental science of computing. By deploying the world\u2019s first 127-qubit processor, we are the only company to have an actual operational computer that is available on our cloud. Companies and governments around the world are taking steps to prepare for Quantum. As an example, we have recently forged new partnerships with HSBC and the Government of Quebec. Delivering organic innovation remains an important and constant focus. At the same time, we continue to make acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio and add value to our clients. In line with this thinking, we completed three acquisitions in the first quarter, Envizi, Neudesic and Sentaca. Clients, partners, employees and investors are placing a premium on ESG, as the world moves towards a more circular and sustainable economy, clients need help on their journey. That is why we recently launched the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a social impact program that applies IBM Technology and Consulting to help populations that are vulnerable to environmental threats. This is just one of the many efforts we have made around ESG, which you can see in IBM Impact, our first integrated ESG report that we released last week. I will wrap up by saying the results you are seeing this quarter are a direct reflection of our ability to execute against our strategy. Each quarter, we have continued to strengthen our portfolio, expand our partner ecosystem and drive productivity and simplification through the business. IBM is now a very different company. We have in effect changed our company\u2019s trajectory and while much remains to be done, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our hard earned efforts and we are confident in our trajectory for the year. Now, let me hand it over to Jim, who will share the details of the quarter and our expectations with you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $14.2 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion of operating pretax income, operating earnings per share of $1.40 and $1.2 billion of free cash flow. 90 days ago, I talked about the first quarter and the full year in the context of our medium-term model, which is to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and about $35 billion of free cash flow from 2022 through 2024. These first quarter results are a solid step toward delivering on the year and that model. Our revenue was up 11%. This includes over 5 points of incremental revenue from the commercial relationship established with Kyndryl last November. Our business entering 2022 reflects a higher growth, higher value mix. It is also a business with more recurring revenue dominated by Software. This quarter, Software revenue was up 15% and Consulting was up 17%. As we have discussed in the past, these are our two growth vectors and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue. Infrastructure performance, which is influenced by product cycles was flat as compared to last year. The Software and Infrastructure performance each include over 8 points from the commercial Kyndryl relationship. As a reminder, there is no incremental contribution to IBM Consulting\u2019s growth. Our strategy, as Arvind said, is based on a platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Not only do we benefit from the platform itself, but IBM and our partners also generate a multiple of Software and Consulting revenue on that platform. It\u2019s an attractive economic model. You can see our success in capturing that value in our hybrid cloud revenue, which was up 17% in the first quarter and over the last 12 months. Revenue from our full stack cloud capabilities from infrastructure up through consulting represents $20.8 billion of revenue over the last 12 months or 36% of our total. Looking at our P&L metrics, we grew operating gross profit dollars, though margin was down, with improvement in software margin offset by Consulting investments and Infrastructure mix due to product cycles. For operating pretax income, we grew profit dollars and expanded margin by 280 basis points. This profit performance reflects that we are capturing demand in high-value areas like software and profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship. We have taken actions to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model, consistent with our more focused platform-centric business. With the more streamlined business, we are getting operating leverage from strong revenue performance. Our profit dynamics also reflect increasing investments in innovation, our ecosystem and talent. We are increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like Quantum. We are investing in our ecosystem organically and inorganically. For example, one of the three acquisitions Arvind mentioned was Neudesic, which adds key hyperscaler capabilities to address hybrid multi-cloud demand. And as we have discussed, over the last several quarters we have been aggressively hiring. We are adding capabilities and skills to support our garages and client engineering centers, client success managers to help clients get the most of their IBM solutions and technical talent across our business. Now, we are operating in an inflationary environment, and costs, especially the cost to attract and retain talent, are escalating. We are addressing this through pricing, which will help over time. The Other item I will mention is the impact of a strengthening dollar. We execute hedging programs, with the majority of our hedging gains reported in Other income and expense. These gains mitigate the currency impact in revenue and gross profit. And then looking at net income, we expanded operating net income margin by 130 basis points. This reflects an operating tax rate of 16%, which was up significantly from last year. Turning to free cash flow, we generated $1.2 billion in the quarter. I will remind you we have gone back to our traditional all-in free cash flow definition, which includes payments for the structural actions initiated at the end of 2020. The $1.2 billion is about 12% of our full year expected range, consistent with history. The anomaly from that historic attainment was last year, with 23% of our full year free cash flow realized in the first quarter due to the unique dynamics of the Kyndryl separation. In terms of uses of cash for the quarter, we invested about $700 million in acquisitions and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. We also issued $4 billion of debt in early February, which supports maturities later in the year. This results in a March cash position of $10.8 billion and debt of over $54 billion. Turning to the segments, Software delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. This includes over 8 points from the recurring Kyndryl software revenue, in line with our expectations. Software performance was driven by good growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions, and Transaction Processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the Kyndryl content. Our software is central to a hybrid cloud value proposition. Within the segment, hybrid cloud revenue was up 25%, now representing $8.8 billion over the last year. And subscription and support renewal rates grew again this quarter, contributing to a software deferred income balance of over $11 billion. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue grew 10% this quarter, inclusive of about a point-and-a-half contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. We have driven focus within this portfolio around the most strategic hybrid cloud and AI needs of our clients, Red Hat, data and AI, automation and security. Growth was pervasive across all business areas this quarter. Red Hat revenue all-in was up 21%. Revenue growth continues to be fueled by good performance across the Red Hat portfolio, and we again gained share across both RHEL and OpenShift, the foundational hybrid cloud offerings. Red Hat\u2019s hybrid cloud offerings continue to transform enterprise IT and deliver new innovations. For example, this quarter we announced a new partnership with NVIDIA to accelerate AI applications. Automation delivered 5% revenue growth this quarter. Growth was led by AIOps and management and integration. We have invested in AI-powered approach to automation and our solutions are resonating with clients as they address growing complexity, digital shifts and skill shortages across their businesses. We extended this AI-powered automation strategy this quarter with the joint Flexera solution Arvind mentioned earlier. Data and AI revenue grew 4%. These offerings help our clients accelerate data-driven agendas by connecting and governing all of their data and infusing AI to enhance decision making. Performance this quarter reflects client demand across the portfolio, including continued adoption of data fabric, expansion of our data management footprint, a focus on sustainable operations with asset and supply chain management, and needs for reliable data sharing with information exchange. We had growth in solutions like Cloud Pak for data, DB2 and Maximo Application Suite, just to name a few.  Security revenue grew 8%, building on strong performance in the first quarter of last year when we were up 14%. With the evolving cybersecurity environment, we delivered growth this quarter in threat management and data security. We continue to see good client demand for Cloud Pak for security, and integrated and open security platform that advances clients\u2019 zero trust strategy while leaving data where it is. And we have been investing in security innovation, including a new SaaS endpoint solution following the ReaQta acquisition. Looking across the performance of our Hybrid Platform & Solutions, our annual recurring revenue or ARR is up 9% year-to-year. Transaction Processing delivered 31% revenue growth this quarter, including 28 points from the Kyndryl content. The overall dynamics are much like last quarter. We wrapped on weak performance in the first quarter of last year, which was down 15% and we continue to see strong renewals of these critical software offerings, building on the expanded zSystem\u2019s capacity and traction we have gotten through the strong z15 program. Looking at software profit, we delivered operating leverage given the strong and broad-based revenue performance this quarter. Our pretax margin was up 7 points and puts us on track for a full year software margin in the mid-20s. Just as in Software, Consulting is capitalizing on strong demand profile, growing both revenue and signings at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Revenue growth accelerated to 17%, while bookings were up over 40%. Our book-to-bill remains solid at 1.1 for the quarter and over the last year. Clients trust IBM to execute their complex business transformations, leveraging our deep industry expertise and the investments we have been making in skills, capabilities, our ecosystem and in scaling our acquisitions. We are positioned to capture demand and drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. Consulting\u2019s hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% on trailing 12-month basis to $8.3 billion, which makes up 45% of the Consulting business. We continue to see strong demand and momentum in our Red Hat-related engagements this quarter, nearly doubling Red Hat-related signings year-to-year. Our strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships grew solid double digits led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure. And now turning to our lines of business, business transformation revenue grew 19%, bringing together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. The growth was broad-based, with particularly strong growth in our practices centered around customer experience, talent and data transformations, as well as supply chain and finance applications. In Technology Consulting, where we architect and implement clients\u2019 cloud platform and strategies, revenue was up 19%. Growth was pervasive, led by our engagements around developing and modernizing applications for cloud deployments. Finally, application operations revenue grew 14%. This business line focuses on the management of applications and cloud platform services required to run hybrid cloud environments. Growth was broad-based in this space as well, led by Cloud Application Management. Moving to consulting profit, our pretax margin expanded about 1 point, delivering operating leverage and benefiting from IBM\u2019s more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting gross margin reflects the significant investments we have made over the last year, fueling our revenue growth. We are investing in our partner ecosystem, expanding our reach. We continue to scale the 12 acquisitions we made in the last 18 months including two which closed in the first quarter. And we are investing in talent across our workforce, up-skilling existing resources, adding certifications and bringing in technical skills in areas of hybrid cloud and AI. Consulting is where we are most impacted by the competitive and inflationary labor market, which puts pressure on profitability. We expect to capture value through price in our engagements and recognize it will take a few quarters to appear in our margin profile. Turning to Infrastructure segment, revenue performance was flat versus last year. Hybrid infrastructure revenue declined 2%, offset by growth of 4% in infrastructure support. The Kyndryl content contributed over 8 points to infrastructure with consistent benefit across the two business areas.  Within Hybrid Infrastructure, the zSystems revenue was down 18%. We are now in the 11th quarter of z15 availability. z15 has been a very strong program, both in revenue performance and capacity. In fact, we ship more z15 MIPS than in any other program. Building on that momentum, we have just announced our newest solution, IBM z16. Arvind commented on the three differentiated capabilities of z16, embedded AI at scale, cyber resilient security and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud. Distributed infrastructure delivered 8% revenue growth this quarter. Client demand for S/4 HANA data-intensive workloads on our newest POWER10 high-end systems fueled this performance. Looking at infrastructure profit, the pretax margin was down 3 points reflecting where we are in our IBM Z product cycle. Now let me take it back up to the IBM level. We focused our business on a platform-centric, hybrid cloud, and AI strategy. Over the last couple of years, we have been taking steps to optimize our portfolio, streamline our operations and allocate capital, to execute that strategy and improve our financial profile. Our first quarter results reflect these very significant changes and put us on track to our full year expectations for our two key measures of revenue growth and free cash flow.  90 days ago, we expected to grow revenue at mid single-digit rate at constant currency before the incremental Kyndryl sales. With the strong start to the year, we now see revenue growth at the high end of that mid single-digit range. On top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth for the year from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl spread over the first three quarters. And then looking at currency, with the strengthening U.S. dollar at mid-April spot rates, currency will now be a 3-point to 4-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. For free cash flow, we continue to expect $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. As I said earlier, this is an all-in free cash flow definition and includes the cash impact associated with our 2020 structural actions. Before getting into the segments and color on the second quarter, I will comment on the business impact of our Russian operation. Our business in Russia is not large, but it\u2019s concentrated in high-end Infrastructure and Software. Last year, business in the country contributed about $300 million of revenue and about $200 million of profit and cash. For this year, we expect no contribution from Russia, which puts us closer to the low-end of our free cash flow range. Now, let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance for the year. In Software, we got off to a good start and we haven\u2019t changed our view of constant currency revenue growth or the contribution from the external sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year. In IBM Consulting, with our first quarter revenue and signings performance, we are taking up our view of Consulting revenue to a low double-digit growth rate for the year. With continued investment in talent and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a pretax margin approaching 10%, which is up a couple points year-to-year. This reflects improving performance in the second half as we realize price increases in our contracts. Our infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. This year, we would expect performance above the model, given the launch of our z16 late in the second quarter. This will contribute to second quarter performance and ramp further in the second half. On top of that, we are planning for about 4 points to 5 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. We see a mid- to high-teens pretax margin for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics would yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM\u2019s pretax margin for the full year. In terms of tax, we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth.  Let me comment on a couple items specific to the second quarter. At current spot rates, currency would be a 5-point headwind to revenue growth. We expect to close the sale of the Healthcare Software assets, with a gain utilized to address stranded costs. And we expect a 4-point to 5-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin and a tax rate in the high teens. Based on our solid first quarter performance and view of the year, we are on track to our midterm model. And now, Patricia, let\u2019s go to the Q&A.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I\u2019d like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation, and then, second, as always, I\u2019d ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let\u2019s please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you.  Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you. Great to see the solid revenue performance and the organic growth guide uptick here. Arvind, a lot of investor conversations now are focused around concerns of the economy steering itself into a recession given the tightening that we are seeing from the fed. Can you maybe characterize how IBM, which has a pretty defensive portfolio, could fare in a recessionary environment given that there have been structural portfolio changes? And a quick one for Jim, you are maintaining your free cash flow guide despite the incremental headwinds from FX and some of the other macro elements you pointed to including Russia, Ukraine. Can you maybe just help us think through how you are offsetting free cash flow impact from FX? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Wamsi, always good to hear from you. Just a comment on the economy and I will call it demand. We are seeing very strong demand. As I said in my prepared remarks, I think, technology has shifted from being just one aspect of a business to being the source of competitive advantage. When that happens, Wamsi, we think and we believe and the past couple of quarters have borne this out, that demand for technology is going to sit at 4 points to 5 points above GDP. Even if GDP falls to flat or there\u2019s a quick recession or if it\u2019s a very slight recession, we see demand staying strong and continuing. Now, I will acknowledge if you have something much more catastrophic, that\u2019s different. But for all the scenarios that we do outline and we do look at, we see that demand is going to continue in a growth phase for the foreseeable future. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yeah. Wamsi, thanks for the question. Just to add to Arvind\u2019s point here right up front about the composition of our portfolio. Now today\u2019s new IBM, that composition being much more skewed towards growth vectors, Software and Consulting, and our solid recurring revenue base that offers us on any economic shocks and I think that\u2019s what you are referencing, Wamsi, in -- if you look at past economic shocks overall. But to your question about free cash flow, let me spend a minute on free cash flow and just give you a perspective and unpack it a little. We are maintaining our guidance at $10 billion to $10.5 billion for 2022. Again, I will remind everyone that\u2019s an all-in free cash flow consistent with IBM\u2019s post-separation baseline and consistent with our mid-term model of a cumulative about $35 billion over the next three years. That basically is growing north of $2 billion of free cash flow in 2022. We started out the first quarter. We delivered $1.24 billion in free cash flow. That\u2019s about 12% attained. And by the way, that\u2019s pretty consistent with where we have been, arguably prior to the last three years, four years, we were in the high-single digits. So we are off to a pretty good start. Now, I spent time last quarter talking about headwinds and tailwinds. On the tailwinds side, we talked about, hang on, we are doing some technical difficulties here. Thank you very much. Hopefully that is better and you can hear me. I am going through headwinds and tailwinds on free cash flow overall. When you look at free cash flow, we talked 90 days ago. We have got tailwinds on remaining about $0.5 billion of structural actions in 2022. We have got about $0.5 billion of working capital efficiency, given our Mainframe cycle and volume dynamics. And we have got a couple $100 million with regards to modest cash tax tailwinds overall. The rest of that $2-plus billion of free cash flow generation has to come from operating profit.  Now, when you look at the first quarter, many of those tailwinds are all in front of us. Our operating profit, that\u2019s the acceleration in revenue, and operating margin by segments, that will continue as we move forward as part of our guidance. Our working capital actually was a use of cash in the first quarter as we prudently built up our inventory position just given the supply chain disruption going on in the marketplace. We secured our supply for the anticipated z16 and we also got most of our structural actions behind us. So we have got a lot of tailwinds going forward that gives us confidence in that $10 billion to 10.5 billion. And the only headwind which we called out in our prepared remarks is the unfortunate situation with regards to the war in Ukraine and we quantified that overall.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a strong topline here. I guess my question is really around, you are raising your top line guide from mid-single digits at the higher end of the mid single-digit range. Could you just talk about what is driving this range, is it organic or is it really the deals that you have done that give you better conviction on the growth trajectory? So the uplift in guide organic versus inorganic to help us understand it better? Maybe related to that, there\u2019s a lot going around what\u2019s happening in Europe very specifically and any spillover potentially from Russia. So I\u2019d love to hear what you see in Europe if there is any spillover from Russia? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Hi, Amit. Let me begin by answering the question on both pieces. So if you look at it, we have always said, our model for acquisition contribution has typically between a point to point-and-a-half for the year and so that remains steady in that range. We don\u2019t really look at that as coming up yet. I will take it certainly if it gets above that, but that is not the case. So what we are seeing right now is strong demand on what you would call the organic part of the portfolio and we can see that in the Software portfolio, we can see that in the strong Red Hat growth. Consulting is largely, by the way, organic growth that is driving it, because we printed 13% of actuals, 17% at constant currency and only a few points of that was acquired growth. So I will say much more organic than acquired. Acquired is in the range that we have called out before. So when you talk about Europe, Jim quantified, certainly Russia is direct and we quantified its impact in direct terms, that $300 million we don\u2019t really expect to see this year at all. Now, when we look at overall growth in Europe, we are still seeing and it is likely because we are in much more I will call it mission-critical applications, we have much more in fundamental transformations at our clients and with the focus on financial volumes, on critical systems, on telecoms, utilities, healthcare, government, we tend to see that right now the demand profile in Europe is staying strong and so we are not seeing at least at this point that demand profile coming down.  As things go on, that could evolve. As I have said before, it\u2019s our jobs to be concerned about all of these things and we have been watching them very carefully. But with our book-to-bill ratios in Consulting, which is kind of a leading edge, we see right now that the demand profile is continuing and has not slowed down at this point.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Amit, thanks for the question. Let\u2019s go to the next one, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to just discuss a little bit the profitability side of the equation. So you beat relative to expectations on revenue, but not on EPS. You have raised your full year guidance for revenue, but not on free cash flow. So I just want to explore the dynamics there, are you seeing incremental pressure just in Consulting and are there other areas? And then I was hoping you could answer two very specific clarifications. One is your operating margin expansion was 280 basis points year-over-year, but obviously you had very high margin Kyndryl contribution. So if we ex out the Kyndryl contribution, what was the change in operating profit PTI percentage year-over-year? And then, secondly, how much is the Healthcare asset sale gain and it sounds like that will be included in free cash flow, could you confirm that as well? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Toni, I will try to handle each one of those. Maybe I will start with the last one first and then go backwards, if it\u2019s okay with you. Thanks for the question. So, healthcare, yes, as we talked about 90 days ago, we still expect to close on the Watson Health divestiture late in the second quarter. It is embedded in our forward-looking guidance. As you know, it is now consistent with what we have been doing with all divestitures. It is now in our Other segment. By the way, history has been restated, so our Software segment and our Other segment are apples-to-apples year-to-year with regards to this. We do expect the lost profit in the second half and the lost revenue, but we do expect a modest gain in the second quarter and we will utilize that gain to address stranded costs. So it\u2019s embedded in our guidance. No impact to second quarter. But obviously we are dealing with the lost revenue top line in the second half, and in light of that, we still took up our guidance to the high-mid single-digit overall. It is -- in our free cash flow, there\u2019s no impact to that overall either. So on operating margins, you asked about 280 basis points. Yes, we are very pleased with our performance, solid start to the year, progress more to do, as Arvind and I have always said. This is a journey. We have given a mid-term model. You all understand our mid-term model. But let me put the profit margin contribution in perspective, because, yes, as we have been transparent both in revenue, and by the way in free cash flow, because our free cash flow is a post-IBM separation baseline, we have got to grow $2-plus billion of free cash flow. Both of those normalize out Kyndryl. But let\u2019s talk about the Kyndryl contribution, because you are right, the pretax income and pretax margin there\u2019s a benefit from the Kyndryl sales. And there\u2019s also -- I am getting an echo. Hopefully we can take care of the technical difficulty. The echo sounds like it went away. But when you take a look at the topline revenue growth, we grew IBM overall 11% at constant currency, all-in. We said within that constant currency, about a little over 5 points is due to the Kyndryl external sales. So call that about 50% of our contribution of growth came from Kyndryl and about 50% of our contribution came from our broader client segments overall. IBM grew revenue in the first quarter by $1 billion externally from last year. So about $500 million of Kyndryl contribution give or take round numbers and about $500 million from our broader set of clients. You apply standard margins, because as you can all appreciate for competitive commercial reasons, we are not going to give exact profitability of any client overall. But if you apply standard margins against that, you get against our $500 million of profit contribution, you get about two-thirds of it coming from Kyndryl sales and about one-third of it coming from IBM. And I will remind you we are on the back end of a very successful Mainframe cycle. And that back end, we were down a couple hundred million in infrastructure profit. So growing IBM both with incremental sales of Kyndryl and with our broader client base on the back end of a Mainframe product cycle, we are pretty pleased with the operating leverage we see in our business and that gives us the confidence in that free cash flow guidance of $10 billion to $10.5 billion.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Thanks, Toni. Let\u2019s go to the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking the call. Really nice performance on Red Hat and Security with growth in both, they are holding up relative to 4Q or accelerating. There was a partially offset, I guess, by a slowdown in automation a bit. But maybe if you could just take us a little deeper, and help us understand really the puts and takes for each of the Software businesses. What surprised you in the quarter? What was more challenged? And then, lastly, just what was the growth contribution from acquisitions in Software in the quarter? Thanks.\nArvind Krishna: Yeah. So, Erik, this is Arvind. Let me start with addressing some of these and Jim will help with some of the precise quantification. So if you look at this overall contribution that you are going through in all of these, let me first address the Kyndryl piece, because that may be in some of your -- behind some of your questions. The Kyndryl contribution was largely in our Mainframe Software segment in the TPP segment. So I will put it there and there we pointed it out. I think 28% of the 31% comes from Kyndryl. Probably as an absolute amount, we expect that to stay going into next year, but obviously, it won\u2019t contribute to growth going forward after this October. Now, as we look at some of the others, a lot of it comes down to the focus and nimbleness in which we are now operating the company, where we have a Technology segment and a Consulting segment. I believe that that is what contributed. Certainly there was demand in the market for security because you asked that question. But the nimbleness and the focus of our teams now allows us to go fulfill that demand and that is why you saw that growth rate come up by 7% to 8% between the fourth quarter, just looking at quarter-to-quarter dynamics. Then when you look at Red Hat, I think, the execution was very good. But Red Hat has been in the upper teens and that is where we expect it to keep performing for the rest of this year and that speaks to both the quality of the portfolio and the demand that\u2019s in the market. Of course, we always have to keep executing against that demand. So I think no real puts and takes in there in these three. Now when we come to the data and AI and automation, I do believe that with some of the acquisitions we did last year and being able to fulfill the demand against those that led to the second half of last year having an accelerated growth rate in automation. And we do expect it to remain within our model. Our model calls for mid single-digit growth in both automation and data and AI. That said, let me just tell you that my instinct from listening to our clients, from seeing what they want to do and from looking at all of the shifts happening in demographics, meaning tech skills are very hard to get, I anticipate that for the market at large, there will be more and more demand in both in automation and in AI. Now the execution is on us to go fulfill against that demand.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yeah. I would just add, Arvind. Erik, thank you very much for the question. Software is obviously an integral part to our hybrid cloud platform-centric thesis overall and Arvind went through the portfolio and the dynamics, but let me add some of the KPIs to that. So it gives you some of the fundamentals underneath the pervasive growth across Red Hat at 21%, automation at 5%, data and AI growing 4% and security with a nice rebound delivering return on the new innovation we brought to market. But when you look underneath it, our Hybrid Platform & Solution, our growth vector, which is about 75% of our Software segment, nice growth double digits overall. Underneath that, we have got an ARR, now a subscription book of business about $13 billion, that is now accelerating, growing 9% overall from an ARR perspective. We have seen nice acceleration in Cloud Pak portfolio underneath that, with a flywheel effect. We are getting NRRs that are north of 100%, I think this quarter it was about 105%. So we have had now three or four consecutive quarters of that flywheel effect. And we are seeing strong renewals across the early parts of our ELA cycle, which is just beginning and that strong renewal is leading to a record deferred income balance north of $11 billion right now and growing nicely. So we feel pretty good about our Software portfolio, a lot of execution in front of us, though.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Erik. Sheila, let\u2019s go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKyle McNealy: Hi. Thanks very much for the question. I\u2019d like to see if we could put a bit of a finer point on the timing when you think the benefit from new pricing and the changes you are making in Consulting will offset some of the cost inflation you are seeing. I believe earlier in the call, you said, that it would take a few quarters to get the benefit, but then you mentioned that second half 2022 Consulting margins will improve based on the pricing coming in. So should we expect better pricing helps Q3 and is there any way you can quantify how many points of margin you might get back by the end of the year? Thanks.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yeah. Thanks, Kyle. Arvind, I will take this one overall. Kyle, great question. I mean, we are obviously operating in an environment of accelerated demand in the Consulting space and I think you see we are capitalizing on that. And we have been talking about this since the second half when we were looking at all of our indicators across the portfolio and our enterprise clients, we saw a pretty robust demand environment and we made a conscious strategy to invest in building out skills capabilities, ecosystem partnerships. And we started if you remember beginning of 2021 investing significantly in acquisitions to build out scale for our hybrid cloud adoption overall. Now, you couple that with the highly inflationary environment right now that we started seeing play out in the latter half of 2021 and we said at that point in time that when you couple the investments we have been making, which is conscious, to build that capability, because Consulting. As I have always said, is the tip of the spear that provides tremendous value in pulling IBM technology and driving scale and adoption of our hybrid cloud platform that you couple that with the inflationary environment, you are seeing the pressure on our gross margins. Now, I will tell you, let me try to quantify a little bit of this. When you look at our gross margins, we were down about 350 basis points in Consulting. Arguably off the toughest compare that we will face in 2022. The compares get easier. So we will acknowledge that right off the bat. Number two, when you look at the inflationary environment, we have been seeing within that 350 basis points about 150 basis points is due to the accelerating cost of talent acquisition. The remaining 2 points or so is about a point of acquisition, which as you know, as you get ramp and scale, those become very quick accretive. We expect that to be accretive as we get into latter half of second quarter and into third quarter. And then we have been investing, when we saw that robust demand environment, we invested a significant amount of capability and capacity. In the early innings of that, you have underutilization. We knew that. That\u2019s why we had to get after our G&A structure to optimize and streamline, by the way, reinventing IBM through automation, digitization, everything our clients are doing, we have been doing inside IBM. That\u2019s been mitigating the profit impact overall. So I think you will start seeing improvement as we get into third quarter. But we will make sequential improvement here in the second quarter overall. But I will tell you again gross margin improvement will turn accretive in third quarter and the second half, but in a pretax operating margin, we have guided to approaching 10%. That\u2019s up a couple points. We will see that improvement throughout the year.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Kyle. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Great. Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Great to see the stability on the Software side, particularly Red Hat growth, but I guess, on the Consulting side. Arvind, maybe I\u2019d love your perspective or perhaps you can share some of what you heard from conversations regarding the sustainability or durability of digital transformation in Consulting spend. And maybe to pivot on Wamsi\u2019s question earlier, we all know Consulting tends to be discretionary in nature, but would love your view on your portfolio of Consulting business and how that might fare in a more, I guess, difficult macro environment where customers may kind of sharpen the pencils on their budgets. Is it different than, say, system integration application engineering Consulting spend?\nArvind Krishna: Yeah. So, Brian, thank you for the question. And it is one that we think a lot about and we talk a lot to our clients about to understand where they are. So if you look at the makeup of our Consulting portfolio and that is we have very little of what I would call the Infrastructure Services. Those all went with Kyndryl. So what we have left is helping clients, and Jim, talked about the very high growth rates with some of our ecosystem partners, that is Consulting around topics like Salesforce and Adobe and public Clouds. Even in difficult environments, we believe that the adoption of those platforms is going to continue with all of our clients. Second, as we look at digitization, so digitization is not just taking something and coloring -- just coloring it and making it digital. But if we look at it as being one of the primary ways to address the labor demographics issue, meaning the shortage of high skill labor that is there pretty much globally, then we believe that that actually continues even in a difficult environment, because it gives our clients a way to go address that. If I take, for example, airline scheduling, if you take re-booking of passengers, if I take quote to cash, where you cut across all of the silos, if I take much more real-time impact of revenue and omnichannel, these are all examples of our Consulting projects, which we see carrying on even through a difficult environment. So when I look at that that tells me there\u2019s a sustainability and durability. I don\u2019t see the number of trained people and experts coming up suddenly, and so consequently, I think, that because of that, because there is a shortage of technical talent in the world, it will continue to go well even in a constrained economic. But, Brian, let me acknowledge. When I say constrained, I mean, if we enter what I will call a mild recession or a quick recession. If you get something deep and sustained, I will put my comments a little bit to the side and we will have to then go look at that again. But I think that, because of the makeup of our portfolio, I think, it will actually fare quite well.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Brian. Sheila, let\u2019s go to the next question?\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. I wanted to just follow up an earlier question on the Consulting gross margins. Historically GBS has operated at a lower gross margin than its peers with the difference somewhere in the kind of 400-basis-point to 500-basis-point range. And I appreciate all of your commentary about GBS margins including the cyclical items and the investments there impacting margins currently. However, looking beyond that, are there structural differences that explain that dynamic or with many of the strategic changes and investments in the business that are underway, is a peer group margin achievable, and if you think it is, what timeframe do you think you can achieve that?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yeah. Why don\u2019t I address that? Thank you, David, for the question overall. When you take a look at the Consulting margin, let\u2019s just take a step back and mark it in to your point. The competitive benchmark right now I would say is probably low- to mid-teens. We are not going to be a pure-play industry, excuse me, India Consulting-based company that has a very different value proposition. But if you look at some of the peers that we benchmark, you are in the low- to mid-teens. We have talked about our mid-term model. Now, that mid-term model as we put out aligns to an integrated IBM thesis of hybrid cloud as a platform-centric business built on the foundation of Red Hat. GBS or excuse me, Consulting has an integral role of not only being a pure-play competitor, but they play a very essential role in driving the scale and adoption of our Software portfolio and also pulling through our Technology. And by the way, we have talked many times about how well they are doing in building up a Red Hat practice. I think inception to date, about a $4.5 billion book of business on top of our hybrid cloud platform-centric thesis and they drive about depending on any quarter, 20% to 30% to 40% of our Cloud Paks. But we talked about our mid-term model that we would get in the low double-digit margin range. That is a three-year picture. So I think we have already given that. At high single-digit revenue growth, the investments we are going to make, the integrated value it delivers IBM, you take that high single-digit revenue growth, you take low double-digit approach into the low teens, we are in a competitive playing field and it\u2019s an integral part of IBM that drives that software portfolio and that profit. So we feel pretty comfortable that that mid-term model answers your question.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, David. Sheila, let\u2019s take one last question?\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nJim Suva: Thank you. Saving the best question for last I guess. A lot of time has already been spent talking about the various segments except really not your Mainframe segment. So maybe I will take a question on that is, you laid out three really nice enhancements to Mainframe. Is that enough you think to make Mainframe be growing over the past cycles or competitive with past cycles? Because people that have been calling for the death of Mainframe for a decade and that death has been greatly exaggerated. I am just kind of thinking about these enhancements, could it actually be more? And then on the profit side of Mainframe, companies like Citigroup, we order Mainframes well in advance but the components have changed with pricing. Is there anything we should be conscious of for the profitability of the new Z Mainframe rolls out? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: So, Jim, let me start with answering your question on the capabilities of Mainframe driving growth in Mainframe and then ask Jim to address the profitability side. So if I look at the demand side on Mainframe, a lot of our clients are seeing additional volumes, because Mainframe serves really well as a system of record as that transactional engine that helps drive our clients\u2019 business. If there is volatility in the markets, if there is 10%, 20%, 30% volume increases, which we are sensing many of our clients see, that is the primary driver of growth. And the second driver of growth where we talked about resiliency is everybody is now wanting to be 24x7 and because of all of the issues around not just resiliency due to physical issues or software errors, but also because of cyber, people are much more concerned, and that drives additional capacity if people want to make sure that there is a working copy of their application and data set available at some other place and that is why you heard us talk about that. Then, as the volumes go up, we know that there is always an indication of fraud that can go up. And because of the fraud, we embedded AI into the processor, so you can now make your fraud decision in line with the transaction decision. And you can imagine whether it\u2019s processing credit cards, whether it\u2019s moving money, all of those capabilities are going to drive that. So if I pack all of that and then unpack it, Jim, I will tell you that we saw over the last three years more growth and better adoption of Mainframe than we have seen in prior cycles. We expect from early signals that we are going to see that continue over the next couple of years. That said, we have got to go out and execute. We have got to make sure that our clients actually are able to quickly deploy these applications that they use and that will allow us to grow the Mainframe over this coming cycle as well.\nJim Kavanaugh: And I will just wrap it up, Jim. Thank you very much for the question. Mainframe is obviously an essential element of our innovation and value strategy overall. We operate the Mainframe as a platform-centric model. So on top of that Mainframe, we have mission-critical software as you know quite well. We have storage, high-end attach. We have maintenance that goes to it. When you look at the z15 cycle, we actually, it\u2019s the first time in a few cycles our profitability of that stack is actually increased really due to where Arvind ended, which is the most successful are ship MIPS cycle that we have ever had from a program. Our installed MIPS capacity now is up over 45% from the prior programs. We have got roughly about $80 million MIPS that are out there today. That\u2019s our opportunity set to deliver tremendous value to our clients, but also monetize that value in many different ways. But you touched on some and I just want to wrap up, because I want to talk a little bit about how Mainframe plays into second quarter and in the summary in the prepared remarks, we talked about the high level of second quarter. But when you look at second quarter from a topline revenue perspective, Mainframe is going to have a major contribution in the historical quarter-to-quarter.  If I look at it from a history of the last three years, we typically do about $900 million of revenue quarter-to-quarter, 1Q to 2Q, all in. And by the way, that excludes the Kyndryl component of this. But when you take a look at this year, we expect 2Q to be a couple hundred million dollars above that historical quarter-to-quarter of $900 million. So call it about $1.1 billion, a little bit more.  Underneath that, Mainframe is going to be a substantial contributor to that. Albeit shipped late in second quarter and also that underlying fundamental business performance is offsetting, as I said in prepared remarks, the continued dollar strengthening, so currency versus history will be a hurt against that. So we will more than offset that currency and that dollar strengthening with a better than historical 2Q revenue compare and Mainframe is going to be a very big piece of it. So Arvind, let me turn it back over to you then.\nArvind Krishna: All right. Thanks, Jim. Let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. Our performance this quarter reflects the actions we have been taking. We have strengthened our portfolio, we are leveraging our ecosystem and we are streamlining our business. While I acknowledge there is always more to do, we are pleased with the start to the year and I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks. Sheila, let me turn it back to you to wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today\u2019s call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. Let me start out with a few of the headline numbers. We delivered $14.2 billion in revenue, $1.5 billion of operating pretax income, operating earnings per share of $1.40 and $1.2 billion of free cash flow. 90 days ago, I talked about the first quarter and the full year in the context of our medium-term model, which is to deliver mid single-digit revenue growth and about $35 billion of free cash flow from 2022 through 2024. These first quarter results are a solid step toward delivering on the year and that model. Our revenue was up 11%. This includes over 5 points of incremental revenue from the commercial relationship established with Kyndryl last November. Our business entering 2022 reflects a higher growth, higher value mix. It is also a business with more recurring revenue dominated by Software. This quarter, Software revenue was up 15% and Consulting was up 17%. As we have discussed in the past, these are our two growth vectors and together represent over 70% of our annual revenue. Infrastructure performance, which is influenced by product cycles was flat as compared to last year. The Software and Infrastructure performance each include over 8 points from the commercial Kyndryl relationship. As a reminder, there is no incremental contribution to IBM Consulting's growth. Our strategy, as Arvind said, is based on a platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Not only do we benefit from the platform itself, but IBM and our partners also generate a multiple of Software and Consulting revenue on that platform. It's an attractive economic model. You can see our success in capturing that value in our hybrid cloud revenue, which was up 17% in the first quarter and over the last 12 months. Revenue from our full stack cloud capabilities from infrastructure up through consulting represents $20.8 billion of revenue over the last 12 months or 36% of our total. Looking at our P&L metrics, we grew operating gross profit dollars, though margin was down, with improvement in software margin offset by Consulting investments and Infrastructure mix due to product cycles. For operating pretax income, we grew profit dollars and expanded margin by 280 basis points. This profit performance reflects that we are capturing demand in high-value areas like software and profit contribution from incremental sales for the new commercial relationship. We have taken actions to streamline our operations and simplify our go-to-market model, consistent with our more focused platform-centric business. With the more streamlined business, we are getting operating leverage from strong revenue performance. Our profit dynamics also reflect increasing investments in innovation, our ecosystem and talent. We are increasing investments in R&D to deliver innovation in AI, hybrid cloud and emerging areas like Quantum. We are investing in our ecosystem organically and inorganically. For example, one of the three acquisitions Arvind mentioned was Neudesic, which adds key hyperscaler capabilities to address hybrid multi-cloud demand. And as we have discussed, over the last several quarters we have been aggressively hiring. We are adding capabilities and skills to support our garages and client engineering centers, client success managers to help clients get the most of their IBM solutions and technical talent across our business. Now, we are operating in an inflationary environment, and costs, especially the cost to attract and retain talent, are escalating. We are addressing this through pricing, which will help over time. The Other item I will mention is the impact of a strengthening dollar. We execute hedging programs, with the majority of our hedging gains reported in Other income and expense. These gains mitigate the currency impact in revenue and gross profit. And then looking at net income, we expanded operating net income margin by 130 basis points. This reflects an operating tax rate of 16%, which was up significantly from last year. Turning to free cash flow, we generated $1.2 billion in the quarter. I will remind you we have gone back to our traditional all-in free cash flow definition, which includes payments for the structural actions initiated at the end of 2020. The $1.2 billion is about 12% of our full year expected range, consistent with history. The anomaly from that historic attainment was last year, with 23% of our full year free cash flow realized in the first quarter due to the unique dynamics of the Kyndryl separation. In terms of uses of cash for the quarter, we invested about $700 million in acquisitions and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. We also issued $4 billion of debt in early February, which supports maturities later in the year. This results in a March cash position of $10.8 billion and debt of over $54 billion. Turning to the segments, Software delivered strong revenue growth, up 15%. This includes over 8 points from the recurring Kyndryl software revenue, in line with our expectations. Software performance was driven by good growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions, and Transaction Processing, the latter benefiting significantly from the Kyndryl content. Our software is central to a hybrid cloud value proposition. Within the segment, hybrid cloud revenue was up 25%, now representing $8.8 billion over the last year. And subscription and support renewal rates grew again this quarter, contributing to a software deferred income balance of over $11 billion. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue grew 10% this quarter, inclusive of about a point-and-a-half contribution from the Kyndryl commercial relationship. We have driven focus within this portfolio around the most strategic hybrid cloud and AI needs of our clients, Red Hat, data and AI, automation and security. Growth was pervasive across all business areas this quarter. Red Hat revenue all-in was up 21%. Revenue growth continues to be fueled by good performance across the Red Hat portfolio, and we again gained share across both RHEL and OpenShift, the foundational hybrid cloud offerings. Red Hat's hybrid cloud offerings continue to transform enterprise IT and deliver new innovations. For example, this quarter we announced a new partnership with NVIDIA to accelerate AI applications. Automation delivered 5% revenue growth this quarter. Growth was led by AIOps and management and integration. We have invested in AI-powered approach to automation and our solutions are resonating with clients as they address growing complexity, digital shifts and skill shortages across their businesses. We extended this AI-powered automation strategy this quarter with the joint Flexera solution Arvind mentioned earlier. Data and AI revenue grew 4%. These offerings help our clients accelerate data-driven agendas by connecting and governing all of their data and infusing AI to enhance decision making. Performance this quarter reflects client demand across the portfolio, including continued adoption of data fabric, expansion of our data management footprint, a focus on sustainable operations with asset and supply chain management, and needs for reliable data sharing with information exchange. We had growth in solutions like Cloud Pak for data, DB2 and Maximo Application Suite, just to name a few.  Security revenue grew 8%, building on strong performance in the first quarter of last year when we were up 14%. With the evolving cybersecurity environment, we delivered growth this quarter in threat management and data security. We continue to see good client demand for Cloud Pak for security, and integrated and open security platform that advances clients' zero trust strategy while leaving data where it is. And we have been investing in security innovation, including a new SaaS endpoint solution following the ReaQta acquisition. Looking across the performance of our Hybrid Platform & Solutions, our annual recurring revenue or ARR is up 9% year-to-year. Transaction Processing delivered 31% revenue growth this quarter, including 28 points from the Kyndryl content. The overall dynamics are much like last quarter. We wrapped on weak performance in the first quarter of last year, which was down 15% and we continue to see strong renewals of these critical software offerings, building on the expanded zSystem's capacity and traction we have gotten through the strong z15 program. Looking at software profit, we delivered operating leverage given the strong and broad-based revenue performance this quarter. Our pretax margin was up 7 points and puts us on track for a full year software margin in the mid-20s. Just as in Software, Consulting is capitalizing on strong demand profile, growing both revenue and signings at double-digit rates across all business lines and geographies. Revenue growth accelerated to 17%, while bookings were up over 40%. Our book-to-bill remains solid at 1.1 for the quarter and over the last year. Clients trust IBM to execute their complex business transformations, leveraging our deep industry expertise and the investments we have been making in skills, capabilities, our ecosystem and in scaling our acquisitions. We are positioned to capture demand and drive adoption of our hybrid cloud platform. Consulting's hybrid cloud revenue grew 32% on trailing 12-month basis to $8.3 billion, which makes up 45% of the Consulting business. We continue to see strong demand and momentum in our Red Hat-related engagements this quarter, nearly doubling Red Hat-related signings year-to-year. Our strategic partnerships also contributed to our performance in the quarter. Revenue from these partnerships grew solid double digits led by Salesforce, SAP, AWS and Azure. And now turning to our lines of business, business transformation revenue grew 19%, bringing together technology and strategic consulting to transform critical workflows at scale. The growth was broad-based, with particularly strong growth in our practices centered around customer experience, talent and data transformations, as well as supply chain and finance applications. In Technology Consulting, where we architect and implement clients' cloud platform and strategies, revenue was up 19%. Growth was pervasive, led by our engagements around developing and modernizing applications for cloud deployments. Finally, application operations revenue grew 14%. This business line focuses on the management of applications and cloud platform services required to run hybrid cloud environments. Growth was broad-based in this space as well, led by Cloud Application Management. Moving to consulting profit, our pretax margin expanded about 1 point, delivering operating leverage and benefiting from IBM's more streamlined G&A and go-to-market structure. Our consulting gross margin reflects the significant investments we have made over the last year, fueling our revenue growth. We are investing in our partner ecosystem, expanding our reach. We continue to scale the 12 acquisitions we made in the last 18 months including two which closed in the first quarter. And we are investing in talent across our workforce, up-skilling existing resources, adding certifications and bringing in technical skills in areas of hybrid cloud and AI. Consulting is where we are most impacted by the competitive and inflationary labor market, which puts pressure on profitability. We expect to capture value through price in our engagements and recognize it will take a few quarters to appear in our margin profile. Turning to Infrastructure segment, revenue performance was flat versus last year. Hybrid infrastructure revenue declined 2%, offset by growth of 4% in infrastructure support. The Kyndryl content contributed over 8 points to infrastructure with consistent benefit across the two business areas.  Within Hybrid Infrastructure, the zSystems revenue was down 18%. We are now in the 11th quarter of z15 availability. z15 has been a very strong program, both in revenue performance and capacity. In fact, we ship more z15 MIPS than in any other program. Building on that momentum, we have just announced our newest solution, IBM z16. Arvind commented on the three differentiated capabilities of z16, embedded AI at scale, cyber resilient security and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud. Distributed infrastructure delivered 8% revenue growth this quarter. Client demand for S/4 HANA data-intensive workloads on our newest POWER10 high-end systems fueled this performance. Looking at infrastructure profit, the pretax margin was down 3 points reflecting where we are in our IBM Z product cycle. Now let me take it back up to the IBM level. We focused our business on a platform-centric, hybrid cloud, and AI strategy. Over the last couple of years, we have been taking steps to optimize our portfolio, streamline our operations and allocate capital, to execute that strategy and improve our financial profile. Our first quarter results reflect these very significant changes and put us on track to our full year expectations for our two key measures of revenue growth and free cash flow.  90 days ago, we expected to grow revenue at mid single-digit rate at constant currency before the incremental Kyndryl sales. With the strong start to the year, we now see revenue growth at the high end of that mid single-digit range. On top of that, we expect about 3.5 points of growth for the year from the commercial relationship with Kyndryl spread over the first three quarters. And then looking at currency, with the strengthening U.S. dollar at mid-April spot rates, currency will now be a 3-point to 4-point headwind to revenue growth for the year. For free cash flow, we continue to expect $10 billion to $10.5 billion in 2022. As I said earlier, this is an all-in free cash flow definition and includes the cash impact associated with our 2020 structural actions. Before getting into the segments and color on the second quarter, I will comment on the business impact of our Russian operation. Our business in Russia is not large, but it's concentrated in high-end Infrastructure and Software. Last year, business in the country contributed about $300 million of revenue and about $200 million of profit and cash. For this year, we expect no contribution from Russia, which puts us closer to the low-end of our free cash flow range. Now, let me provide some color on our expectations for segment performance for the year. In Software, we got off to a good start and we haven't changed our view of constant currency revenue growth or the contribution from the external sales to Kyndryl. We also remain on track to a software pretax margin in the mid-20s range for the year. In IBM Consulting, with our first quarter revenue and signings performance, we are taking up our view of Consulting revenue to a low double-digit growth rate for the year. With continued investment in talent and a competitive labor environment, we now expect a pretax margin approaching 10%, which is up a couple points year-to-year. This reflects improving performance in the second half as we realize price increases in our contracts. Our infrastructure revenue performance, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. This year, we would expect performance above the model, given the launch of our z16 late in the second quarter. This will contribute to second quarter performance and ramp further in the second half. On top of that, we are planning for about 4 points to 5 points from the external sales to Kyndryl in 2022. We see a mid- to high-teens pretax margin for the full year. These segment revenue and margin dynamics would yield about a 4-point year-to-year improvement in IBM's pretax margin for the full year. In terms of tax, we continue to expect a mid- to high-teens operating tax rate, which is a headwind to our profit growth.  Let me comment on a couple items specific to the second quarter. At current spot rates, currency would be a 5-point headwind to revenue growth. We expect to close the sale of the Healthcare Software assets, with a gain utilized to address stranded costs. And we expect a 4-point to 5-point year-to-year improvement in operating pretax margin and a tax rate in the high teens. Based on our solid first quarter performance and view of the year, we are on track to our midterm model. And now, Patricia, let's go to the Q&A. Yeah. Wamsi, thanks for the question. Just to add to Arvind's point here right up front about the composition of our portfolio. Now today's new IBM, that composition being much more skewed towards growth vectors, Software and Consulting, and our solid recurring revenue base that offers us on any economic shocks and I think that's what you are referencing, Wamsi, in -- if you look at past economic shocks overall. But to your question about free cash flow, let me spend a minute on free cash flow and just give you a perspective and unpack it a little. We are maintaining our guidance at $10 billion to $10.5 billion for 2022. Again, I will remind everyone that's an all-in free cash flow consistent with IBM's post-separation baseline and consistent with our mid-term model of a cumulative about $35 billion over the next three years. That basically is growing north of $2 billion of free cash flow in 2022. We started out the first quarter. We delivered $1.24 billion in free cash flow. That's about 12% attained. And by the way, that's pretty consistent with where we have been, arguably prior to the last three years, four years, we were in the high-single digits. So we are off to a pretty good start. Now, I spent time last quarter talking about headwinds and tailwinds. On the tailwinds side, we talked about, hang on, we are doing some technical difficulties here. Thank you very much. Hopefully that is better and you can hear me. I am going through headwinds and tailwinds on free cash flow overall. When you look at free cash flow, we talked 90 days ago. We have got tailwinds on remaining about $0.5 billion of structural actions in 2022. We have got about $0.5 billion of working capital efficiency, given our Mainframe cycle and volume dynamics. And we have got a couple $100 million with regards to modest cash tax tailwinds overall. The rest of that $2-plus billion of free cash flow generation has to come from operating profit.  Now, when you look at the first quarter, many of those tailwinds are all in front of us. Our operating profit, that's the acceleration in revenue, and operating margin by segments, that will continue as we move forward as part of our guidance. Our working capital actually was a use of cash in the first quarter as we prudently built up our inventory position just given the supply chain disruption going on in the marketplace. We secured our supply for the anticipated z16 and we also got most of our structural actions behind us. So we have got a lot of tailwinds going forward that gives us confidence in that $10 billion to 10.5 billion. And the only headwind which we called out in our prepared remarks is the unfortunate situation with regards to the war in Ukraine and we quantified that overall. Okay. Toni, I will try to handle each one of those. Maybe I will start with the last one first and then go backwards, if it's okay with you. Thanks for the question. So, healthcare, yes, as we talked about 90 days ago, we still expect to close on the Watson Health divestiture late in the second quarter. It is embedded in our forward-looking guidance. As you know, it is now consistent with what we have been doing with all divestitures. It is now in our Other segment. By the way, history has been restated, so our Software segment and our Other segment are apples-to-apples year-to-year with regards to this. We do expect the lost profit in the second half and the lost revenue, but we do expect a modest gain in the second quarter and we will utilize that gain to address stranded costs. So it's embedded in our guidance. No impact to second quarter. But obviously we are dealing with the lost revenue top line in the second half, and in light of that, we still took up our guidance to the high-mid single-digit overall. It is -- in our free cash flow, there's no impact to that overall either. So on operating margins, you asked about 280 basis points. Yes, we are very pleased with our performance, solid start to the year, progress more to do, as Arvind and I have always said. This is a journey. We have given a mid-term model. You all understand our mid-term model. But let me put the profit margin contribution in perspective, because, yes, as we have been transparent both in revenue, and by the way in free cash flow, because our free cash flow is a post-IBM separation baseline, we have got to grow $2-plus billion of free cash flow. Both of those normalize out Kyndryl. But let's talk about the Kyndryl contribution, because you are right, the pretax income and pretax margin there's a benefit from the Kyndryl sales. And there's also -- I am getting an echo. Hopefully we can take care of the technical difficulty. The echo sounds like it went away. But when you take a look at the topline revenue growth, we grew IBM overall 11% at constant currency, all-in. We said within that constant currency, about a little over 5 points is due to the Kyndryl external sales. So call that about 50% of our contribution of growth came from Kyndryl and about 50% of our contribution came from our broader client segments overall. IBM grew revenue in the first quarter by $1 billion externally from last year. So about $500 million of Kyndryl contribution give or take round numbers and about $500 million from our broader set of clients. You apply standard margins, because as you can all appreciate for competitive commercial reasons, we are not going to give exact profitability of any client overall. But if you apply standard margins against that, you get against our $500 million of profit contribution, you get about two-thirds of it coming from Kyndryl sales and about one-third of it coming from IBM. And I will remind you we are on the back end of a very successful Mainframe cycle. And that back end, we were down a couple hundred million in infrastructure profit. So growing IBM both with incremental sales of Kyndryl and with our broader client base on the back end of a Mainframe product cycle, we are pretty pleased with the operating leverage we see in our business and that gives us the confidence in that free cash flow guidance of $10 billion to $10.5 billion. Yeah. I would just add, Arvind. Erik, thank you very much for the question. Software is obviously an integral part to our hybrid cloud platform-centric thesis overall and Arvind went through the portfolio and the dynamics, but let me add some of the KPIs to that. So it gives you some of the fundamentals underneath the pervasive growth across Red Hat at 21%, automation at 5%, data and AI growing 4% and security with a nice rebound delivering return on the new innovation we brought to market. But when you look underneath it, our Hybrid Platform & Solution, our growth vector, which is about 75% of our Software segment, nice growth double digits overall. Underneath that, we have got an ARR, now a subscription book of business about $13 billion, that is now accelerating, growing 9% overall from an ARR perspective. We have seen nice acceleration in Cloud Pak portfolio underneath that, with a flywheel effect. We are getting NRRs that are north of 100%, I think this quarter it was about 105%. So we have had now three or four consecutive quarters of that flywheel effect. And we are seeing strong renewals across the early parts of our ELA cycle, which is just beginning and that strong renewal is leading to a record deferred income balance north of $11 billion right now and growing nicely. So we feel pretty good about our Software portfolio, a lot of execution in front of us, though. Yeah. Thanks, Kyle. Arvind, I will take this one overall. Kyle, great question. I mean, we are obviously operating in an environment of accelerated demand in the Consulting space and I think you see we are capitalizing on that. And we have been talking about this since the second half when we were looking at all of our indicators across the portfolio and our enterprise clients, we saw a pretty robust demand environment and we made a conscious strategy to invest in building out skills capabilities, ecosystem partnerships. And we started if you remember beginning of 2021 investing significantly in acquisitions to build out scale for our hybrid cloud adoption overall. Now, you couple that with the highly inflationary environment right now that we started seeing play out in the latter half of 2021 and we said at that point in time that when you couple the investments we have been making, which is conscious, to build that capability, because Consulting. As I have always said, is the tip of the spear that provides tremendous value in pulling IBM technology and driving scale and adoption of our hybrid cloud platform that you couple that with the inflationary environment, you are seeing the pressure on our gross margins. Now, I will tell you, let me try to quantify a little bit of this. When you look at our gross margins, we were down about 350 basis points in Consulting. Arguably off the toughest compare that we will face in 2022. The compares get easier. So we will acknowledge that right off the bat. Number two, when you look at the inflationary environment, we have been seeing within that 350 basis points about 150 basis points is due to the accelerating cost of talent acquisition. The remaining 2 points or so is about a point of acquisition, which as you know, as you get ramp and scale, those become very quick accretive. We expect that to be accretive as we get into latter half of second quarter and into third quarter. And then we have been investing, when we saw that robust demand environment, we invested a significant amount of capability and capacity. In the early innings of that, you have underutilization. We knew that. That's why we had to get after our G&A structure to optimize and streamline, by the way, reinventing IBM through automation, digitization, everything our clients are doing, we have been doing inside IBM. That's been mitigating the profit impact overall. So I think you will start seeing improvement as we get into third quarter. But we will make sequential improvement here in the second quarter overall. But I will tell you again gross margin improvement will turn accretive in third quarter and the second half, but in a pretax operating margin, we have guided to approaching 10%. That's up a couple points. We will see that improvement throughout the year. Yeah. Why don't I address that? Thank you, David, for the question overall. When you take a look at the Consulting margin, let's just take a step back and mark it in to your point. The competitive benchmark right now I would say is probably low- to mid-teens. We are not going to be a pure-play industry, excuse me, India Consulting-based company that has a very different value proposition. But if you look at some of the peers that we benchmark, you are in the low- to mid-teens. We have talked about our mid-term model. Now, that mid-term model as we put out aligns to an integrated IBM thesis of hybrid cloud as a platform-centric business built on the foundation of Red Hat. GBS or excuse me, Consulting has an integral role of not only being a pure-play competitor, but they play a very essential role in driving the scale and adoption of our Software portfolio and also pulling through our Technology. And by the way, we have talked many times about how well they are doing in building up a Red Hat practice. I think inception to date, about a $4.5 billion book of business on top of our hybrid cloud platform-centric thesis and they drive about depending on any quarter, 20% to 30% to 40% of our Cloud Paks. But we talked about our mid-term model that we would get in the low double-digit margin range. That is a three-year picture. So I think we have already given that. At high single-digit revenue growth, the investments we are going to make, the integrated value it delivers IBM, you take that high single-digit revenue growth, you take low double-digit approach into the low teens, we are in a competitive playing field and it's an integral part of IBM that drives that software portfolio and that profit. So we feel pretty comfortable that that mid-term model answers your question. And I will just wrap it up, Jim. Thank you very much for the question. Mainframe is obviously an essential element of our innovation and value strategy overall. We operate the Mainframe as a platform-centric model. So on top of that Mainframe, we have mission-critical software as you know quite well. We have storage, high-end attach. We have maintenance that goes to it. When you look at the z15 cycle, we actually, it's the first time in a few cycles our profitability of that stack is actually increased really due to where Arvind ended, which is the most successful are ship MIPS cycle that we have ever had from a program. Our installed MIPS capacity now is up over 45% from the prior programs. We have got roughly about $80 million MIPS that are out there today. That's our opportunity set to deliver tremendous value to our clients, but also monetize that value in many different ways. But you touched on some and I just want to wrap up, because I want to talk a little bit about how Mainframe plays into second quarter and in the summary in the prepared remarks, we talked about the high level of second quarter. But when you look at second quarter from a topline revenue perspective, Mainframe is going to have a major contribution in the historical quarter-to-quarter.  If I look at it from a history of the last three years, we typically do about $900 million of revenue quarter-to-quarter, 1Q to 2Q, all in. And by the way, that excludes the Kyndryl component of this. But when you take a look at this year, we expect 2Q to be a couple hundred million dollars above that historical quarter-to-quarter of $900 million. So call it about $1.1 billion, a little bit more.  Underneath that, Mainframe is going to be a substantial contributor to that. Albeit shipped late in second quarter and also that underlying fundamental business performance is offsetting, as I said in prepared remarks, the continued dollar strengthening, so currency versus history will be a hurt against that. So we will more than offset that currency and that dollar strengthening with a better than historical 2Q revenue compare and Mainframe is going to be a very big piece of it. So Arvind, let me turn it back over to you then."

            "content": "Thank you, Patricia, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Our first quarter results reflect the changes we have made to position our business for the future. This solid start to the year reinforces our confidence in our strategy and we now see revenue growth for 2022 at the high end of our mid single-digit model. What we are hearing from clients is clear. Technology has become a fundamental source of competitive advantage. It is at the very center of how businesses scale and is no longer perceived primarily as a way to cut costs. This is especially true in our current environment. Harnessing the power of technology such as Hybrid Cloud and AI remains essential as our clients face a number of strategic challenges and opportunities, whether it's competing for talent, supply chain issues, inflation, cybersecurity or geopolitical instability. We continue to see a strong demand environment for both technology and consulting, as we help our clients respond to these issues. Over the last two years, we have been optimizing our portfolio, expanding our ecosystem, and simplifying our go-to-market to capture this demand. This quarter, we again had double-digit revenue growth in Consulting and Software growth reflects solid performance across the portfolio. Our Infrastructure business, as always, reflects product cycle dynamics. Our revenue performance this quarter is a strong indication that our focus, our investments and our actions are paying off. Before we go further, let me say a few words about the war in Ukraine. We are first and foremost focused on the safety and security of our employees. IBM is providing help, including relocation assistance and financial support to IBMers in the region and matching donations from our employees around the world to non-profits. In terms of the business impact from Russia, Jim will quantify, but I will say the impact is measurable, but not large. Let me now turn to the progress we are making when it comes to our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. Hybrid cloud is all about providing a platform that can straddle multiple public clouds, private clouds and on-premise properties that our clients typically have. The platform we have built is open, secure, and flexible. At its core, it is based on Red Hat, which gives clients powerful software capabilities based on open-source innovation. Our software has been optimized for that platform and helps our clients supply AI, automation and security to make their business work better.  Our global team of consultants offers deep business expertise. They do this by co-creating with clients and finding ways to harness the power of technology to accelerate their digital transformation journey. Our Infrastructure allows clients to take full advantage of an extended hybrid cloud environment. This platform-centric strategy is producing solid results. We have more than 4,000 hybrid cloud platform clients, including 200 added in the first quarter. This gives us two avenues of growth from the incremental number of clients, but more importantly, it allows us to expand our software, consulting and infrastructure footprint at these clients.  Clients such as Charles Schwab, Discover Financial, and the U.S. Department of Education have all recently chosen IBM's hybrid cloud capabilities to digitally transform and build new and differentiated experiences and services. Clients also turn to IBM's AI capabilities to move their employees to higher value tasks and improve their customer experiences. For instance, IBM is now working with McDonald's to pilot an automated drive-thru experience with Watson Orders. In addition, TD Securities is using IBM's AI-powered virtual assistant in support of their precious metals digital store. We were recently recognized in this area as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant. These highlight our ability to drive innovation in natural language processing and bring these new capabilities to clients. An important element of our platform strategy is our partner ecosystem where we continue to gain momentum. We see this in IBM Consulting, where signings with our ecosystem partners were up more than 50% to $2 billion this quarter. In the first quarter, we continued to broaden our ecosystem. We announced an expansion of our strategic partnership with SAP, serving as SAP's RISE premium partner to help clients move workloads to the cloud. With Adobe, we announced a significant expansion of a partnership around the use of AI-powered weather data on the Adobe experience platform. We are collaborating with Worley and ABB to build a digitally-enabled solution that will help energy companies build and operate green hydrogen facilities more efficiently and at scale. We also signed an agreement to join the UAE's network of Industry 4.0 Champions, a major public/private partnership designed to accelerate the digital transformation of the country's industrial sector. Within IBM, we are making significant changes to the way we work to build a client-centric culture based on technical excellence. Our new client engagement model based on experiential selling, client engineering and co-creation is strongly resonating among clients. Over the last few quarters, sales productivity is rising, renewal rates are increasing and recurring revenue is growing. While we are focused on meeting the needs of clients today, we continue to shift to technologies of tomorrow. Most recently, we announced the IBM z16 platform in early April. z16 is designed for cloud-native development, cybersecurity resilience and includes an on-chip AI accelerator. This allows clients to reduce fraud within real-time transactions. The z16 exemplifies our ability to drive critical innovations to a platform that remains essential to the world's economy. At the same time, we are bullish on the immense potential that automation represents. We firmly believe that our AIOps capabilities are poised to seize this significant opportunity. In the last quarter, we announced a new AIOps solution in collaboration with Flexera that is designed to automate software license compliance. Quantum is another example of our commitment to advance the fundamental science of computing. By deploying the world's first 127-qubit processor, we are the only company to have an actual operational computer that is available on our cloud. Companies and governments around the world are taking steps to prepare for Quantum. As an example, we have recently forged new partnerships with HSBC and the Government of Quebec. Delivering organic innovation remains an important and constant focus. At the same time, we continue to make acquisitions to strengthen our portfolio and add value to our clients. In line with this thinking, we completed three acquisitions in the first quarter, Envizi, Neudesic and Sentaca. Clients, partners, employees and investors are placing a premium on ESG, as the world moves towards a more circular and sustainable economy, clients need help on their journey. That is why we recently launched the IBM Sustainability Accelerator, a social impact program that applies IBM Technology and Consulting to help populations that are vulnerable to environmental threats. This is just one of the many efforts we have made around ESG, which you can see in IBM Impact, our first integrated ESG report that we released last week. I will wrap up by saying the results you are seeing this quarter are a direct reflection of our ability to execute against our strategy. Each quarter, we have continued to strengthen our portfolio, expand our partner ecosystem and drive productivity and simplification through the business. IBM is now a very different company. We have in effect changed our company's trajectory and while much remains to be done, we are beginning to reap the rewards of our hard earned efforts and we are confident in our trajectory for the year. Now, let me hand it over to Jim, who will share the details of the quarter and our expectations with you. Wamsi, always good to hear from you. Just a comment on the economy and I will call it demand. We are seeing very strong demand. As I said in my prepared remarks, I think, technology has shifted from being just one aspect of a business to being the source of competitive advantage. When that happens, Wamsi, we think and we believe and the past couple of quarters have borne this out, that demand for technology is going to sit at 4 points to 5 points above GDP. Even if GDP falls to flat or there's a quick recession or if it's a very slight recession, we see demand staying strong and continuing. Now, I will acknowledge if you have something much more catastrophic, that's different. But for all the scenarios that we do outline and we do look at, we see that demand is going to continue in a growth phase for the foreseeable future. Jim? Hi, Amit. Let me begin by answering the question on both pieces. So if you look at it, we have always said, our model for acquisition contribution has typically between a point to point-and-a-half for the year and so that remains steady in that range. We don't really look at that as coming up yet. I will take it certainly if it gets above that, but that is not the case. So what we are seeing right now is strong demand on what you would call the organic part of the portfolio and we can see that in the Software portfolio, we can see that in the strong Red Hat growth. Consulting is largely, by the way, organic growth that is driving it, because we printed 13% of actuals, 17% at constant currency and only a few points of that was acquired growth. So I will say much more organic than acquired. Acquired is in the range that we have called out before. So when you talk about Europe, Jim quantified, certainly Russia is direct and we quantified its impact in direct terms, that $300 million we don't really expect to see this year at all. Now, when we look at overall growth in Europe, we are still seeing and it is likely because we are in much more I will call it mission-critical applications, we have much more in fundamental transformations at our clients and with the focus on financial volumes, on critical systems, on telecoms, utilities, healthcare, government, we tend to see that right now the demand profile in Europe is staying strong and so we are not seeing at least at this point that demand profile coming down.  As things go on, that could evolve. As I have said before, it's our jobs to be concerned about all of these things and we have been watching them very carefully. But with our book-to-bill ratios in Consulting, which is kind of a leading edge, we see right now that the demand profile is continuing and has not slowed down at this point. Yeah. So, Erik, this is Arvind. Let me start with addressing some of these and Jim will help with some of the precise quantification. So if you look at this overall contribution that you are going through in all of these, let me first address the Kyndryl piece, because that may be in some of your -- behind some of your questions. The Kyndryl contribution was largely in our Mainframe Software segment in the TPP segment. So I will put it there and there we pointed it out. I think 28% of the 31% comes from Kyndryl. Probably as an absolute amount, we expect that to stay going into next year, but obviously, it won't contribute to growth going forward after this October. Now, as we look at some of the others, a lot of it comes down to the focus and nimbleness in which we are now operating the company, where we have a Technology segment and a Consulting segment. I believe that that is what contributed. Certainly there was demand in the market for security because you asked that question. But the nimbleness and the focus of our teams now allows us to go fulfill that demand and that is why you saw that growth rate come up by 7% to 8% between the fourth quarter, just looking at quarter-to-quarter dynamics. Then when you look at Red Hat, I think, the execution was very good. But Red Hat has been in the upper teens and that is where we expect it to keep performing for the rest of this year and that speaks to both the quality of the portfolio and the demand that's in the market. Of course, we always have to keep executing against that demand. So I think no real puts and takes in there in these three. Now when we come to the data and AI and automation, I do believe that with some of the acquisitions we did last year and being able to fulfill the demand against those that led to the second half of last year having an accelerated growth rate in automation. And we do expect it to remain within our model. Our model calls for mid single-digit growth in both automation and data and AI. That said, let me just tell you that my instinct from listening to our clients, from seeing what they want to do and from looking at all of the shifts happening in demographics, meaning tech skills are very hard to get, I anticipate that for the market at large, there will be more and more demand in both in automation and in AI. Now the execution is on us to go fulfill against that demand. Yeah. So, Brian, thank you for the question. And it is one that we think a lot about and we talk a lot to our clients about to understand where they are. So if you look at the makeup of our Consulting portfolio and that is we have very little of what I would call the Infrastructure Services. Those all went with Kyndryl. So what we have left is helping clients, and Jim, talked about the very high growth rates with some of our ecosystem partners, that is Consulting around topics like Salesforce and Adobe and public Clouds. Even in difficult environments, we believe that the adoption of those platforms is going to continue with all of our clients. Second, as we look at digitization, so digitization is not just taking something and coloring -- just coloring it and making it digital. But if we look at it as being one of the primary ways to address the labor demographics issue, meaning the shortage of high skill labor that is there pretty much globally, then we believe that that actually continues even in a difficult environment, because it gives our clients a way to go address that. If I take, for example, airline scheduling, if you take re-booking of passengers, if I take quote to cash, where you cut across all of the silos, if I take much more real-time impact of revenue and omnichannel, these are all examples of our Consulting projects, which we see carrying on even through a difficult environment. So when I look at that that tells me there's a sustainability and durability. I don't see the number of trained people and experts coming up suddenly, and so consequently, I think, that because of that, because there is a shortage of technical talent in the world, it will continue to go well even in a constrained economic. But, Brian, let me acknowledge. When I say constrained, I mean, if we enter what I will call a mild recession or a quick recession. If you get something deep and sustained, I will put my comments a little bit to the side and we will have to then go look at that again. But I think that, because of the makeup of our portfolio, I think, it will actually fare quite well. So, Jim, let me start with answering your question on the capabilities of Mainframe driving growth in Mainframe and then ask Jim to address the profitability side. So if I look at the demand side on Mainframe, a lot of our clients are seeing additional volumes, because Mainframe serves really well as a system of record as that transactional engine that helps drive our clients' business. If there is volatility in the markets, if there is 10%, 20%, 30% volume increases, which we are sensing many of our clients see, that is the primary driver of growth. And the second driver of growth where we talked about resiliency is everybody is now wanting to be 24x7 and because of all of the issues around not just resiliency due to physical issues or software errors, but also because of cyber, people are much more concerned, and that drives additional capacity if people want to make sure that there is a working copy of their application and data set available at some other place and that is why you heard us talk about that. Then, as the volumes go up, we know that there is always an indication of fraud that can go up. And because of the fraud, we embedded AI into the processor, so you can now make your fraud decision in line with the transaction decision. And you can imagine whether it's processing credit cards, whether it's moving money, all of those capabilities are going to drive that. So if I pack all of that and then unpack it, Jim, I will tell you that we saw over the last three years more growth and better adoption of Mainframe than we have seen in prior cycles. We expect from early signals that we are going to see that continue over the next couple of years. That said, we have got to go out and execute. We have got to make sure that our clients actually are able to quickly deploy these applications that they use and that will allow us to grow the Mainframe over this coming cycle as well. All right. Thanks, Jim. Let me just make a couple of comments to wrap up the call. Our performance this quarter reflects the actions we have been taking. We have strengthened our portfolio, we are leveraging our ecosystem and we are streamlining our business. While I acknowledge there is always more to do, we are pleased with the start to the year and I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon."

Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and sustainability of our revenue growth. We are pleased with the progress we made in 2023, delivering revenue growth of 3% and over $11 billion of free cash flow, two-thirds of the way through our midterm model, I am proud of our achievements. Since 2021, we delivered average revenue growth for IBM and for each segment at or above our model. The overall trends we are seeing reinforce our views of the future. We are confident in achieving our midterm revenue model, and the strength of our diversified business model allows us to make progress each quarter. We entered the year intent on enhancing our Software portfolio and strengthening our Consulting position. We have done both. Mid-last year, we launched watsonx, our flagship AI and data platform, and we are excited by the traction we are seeing. Consulting has delivered durable revenue growth through the year despite an uneven macro environment. Our expanding ecosystem, skills and technical expertise, global reach and co-creation approach not only set us apart but also contributed to our consulting performance outpacing that of our competitors. This year also underscored the enduring nature and relevance of our zSystems platform. Before getting into the execution of our strategy, I'll make a few comments about what we see in the current environment. I expect many macro trends to be similar to 2023. Technology demand will continue to be strong and serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth. It allows businesses to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. Every client I speak with is asking about how to boost productivity with AI and how to manage their technology stack, much of which is deployed across a hybrid environment, public, private and on-premises. These trends continue to fuel demand for both hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy, starting with AI. Our approach to AI for business is resonating. Earlier in '23, we introduced watsonx, IBM's core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate and deploy AI models. We believe AI will be multi-model with our clients leveraging a combination of models. IBM's, open source, their own proprietary models and those of other companies. Flexibility of deployment is key. Simply put, we meet clients where they are and allow clients to deploy AI models across multiple environments. In the fourth quarter, we released watsonx.governance to help clients and partners govern and instill trust in generative AI. This toolkit helps organizations manage and monitor their AI and prepare for compliance with future AI-related regulations. IBM was recently named a leader in generative AI for governance platforms by IDC. As I have mentioned before, IBM was one of the first companies to announce indemnification of all our models. Additionally, IBM and Meta announced in December the formation of the AI Alliance, a group of 70 industry and academic leaders joining together to advance open, safe and responsible AI. We continue to believe our consulting business will be an early beneficiary of AI. We are the only provider today that offers both the technology stack with our watsonx platform and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI. The early work for clients around data architecture, security and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful practice around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are on a similar trajectory with generative AI. Consulting is a core driver of our value proposition for clients. Last quarter, I shared with you that our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI and watsonx was in the low hundreds of millions. Since then, demand continues to increase and our book of business in the fourth quarter is roughly double the third quarter amount. We continue to have thousands of hands-on client interactions, including an acceleration in pilots that were completed during the quarter. Software transaction revenue and SaaS ACV was approximately 1/3 of our book of business related to generative AI in the fourth quarter and 2/3 was consulting signings. There was a balance of both large and small transactions across both segments. Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service and digital labor continue to offer meaningful near-term benefits to clients. We've been collaborating with numerous clients using watsonx code assistant for Ansible. This includes a successful pilot with Citi, where initial results point to substantial developer productivity and core quality improvements that have led to plans for a rapid expansion focused on scaling for enterprise-wide outcomes. This is just one of many examples. In other industries, we have done work with clients such as NatWest, Lockheed Martin and Boehringer Ingelheim. We are working on an interesting use case with the Sevilla Football Club using watsonx to find the right players to sign by describing attributes across the database of more than 200,000 scouting reports. As clients build out their AI strategies and focus on driving ROI and productivity, the importance of optimizing IT spend and consumption is magnified. Apptio, our virtual command center for managing technology investments, comes up in nearly all of my client discussions. The value proposition is clearly resonating. Looking beyond AI, we had a number of important client wins in the fourth quarter. For example, we're helping NATO strengthen their cybersecurity posture and build out a customized solution to have greater visibility into cyber threats and respond to them more quickly. We are working with Riyadh Air to help them drive their digital and technology strategy and establish their hybrid cloud integration platform. We also saw meaningful consulting renewals, which combined with new wins highlights the focus and unique strengths of our capabilities. Our strategic partnerships with companies such as SAP, AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe continue to expand and thrive. For instance, we are working together with Adobe to embed watsonx into their platform. We also continue to deepen our partnership with SAP through further collaboration across watsonx and Quantum. We also have several new watsonx ISV partners. What we see is clear, many ISVs are eager to work with us as a trusted provider that understands enterprise needs. We continue to invest and bring new innovations to the market in other areas as well. In the quarter, Red Hat enhanced its Ansible automation platform, introducing new offerings like Ansible Light Speed and event-driven Ansible. We announced the availability of Red Hat device edge to manage their workloads and deliver automation at the edge. In quantum computing, we introduced Heron, the most advanced quantum processor; and the System 2, a module of quantum computer. Focusing our portfolio remains a key priority. We completed 9 acquisitions this year, including Apptio, and we recently announced the acquisition of Stream Sets and Web Methods from Software AG, which we expect to close midyear. With respect to divestitures, we announced the sale of our Weather assets, which we expect to close in the first quarter. We also announced the Enterprise AI Venture Fund, a $500 million fund with the goal of partnering with the start-up community to tap into the latest AI innovations in the market and help them scale. In summary, I believe that the changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years position us for the evolving technology landscape. As I reflect on our performance since we presented our midterm model in October of 2021, I am pleased with the progress we have made internally and with our clients. We have delivered average revenue growth for IBM in line with our midterm model and this is true for all our segments. Software has delivered average growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model. Consulting delivered average growth in line with the high single-digit model and Infrastructure is well ahead of expectations. This performance gives me confidence as we move into the new year. For 2024, we expect performance in line with our mid-term model with mid-single digit revenue growth and about $12 million of free cash flow. This keeps us firmly on a path of sustainable growth. Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter and our expectations for 2024. Jim, over to you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $17.4 billion in revenue, $4.2 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $3.87, and we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow. This wrapped up another solid year, where we continue to deliver durable growth in our repositioned business aligned with client priorities of digital transformation and driving productivity. Taking a step back, let me touch on a full year before I go into additional details of the quarter. Our revenue for the year was nearly $62 billion, up 3% and in line with our expectation 90 days ago. We generated $10.3 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $9.62. Our free cash flow was $11.2 billion, our strongest level of cash generation since 2019. Revenue performance for the year was again led by software and consulting. Software grew by over 5% with good growth across Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. Consulting revenue was up over 6% with solid growth every quarter and broad-based growth across all 3 lines of business, highlighting the durability of our results and differentiated client offerings. Infrastructure was down 4%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Our revenue growth and productivity initiatives led to margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. For the full year, we expanded operating gross profit margin by 130 basis points with every segment growing margin across every quarter. Our operating pretax margin expanded by 40 basis points, in line with our expectations and driven by strong productivity gains and operating leverage. And this includes a 110-basis point headwind from currency dynamics. Now turning to a deeper dive on the quarter. Our revenue was up over 3%. Software revenue was up 2%. Our fourth quarter performance reflects continued growth in our recurring revenue and a wrap on last year's seasonally strong transactional performance. Consulting had another solid quarter with 5.5% revenue growth, which is a sequential improvement in the growth rate. We had good signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio over 1.15. This continued momentum in consulting is reflective of how we work with clients, the investment we are making in skills and talent, velocity in our strategic partnerships, and our integrated value proposition. We had great Infrastructure performance this quarter. Revenue was up 2% with growth in both zSystems and distributed infrastructure. This performance is particularly notable given it's the seventh quarter of the z16 cycle and in our seasonally largest quarter, again, highlighting the innovation we are bringing to this mission-critical platform. Looking at our profit metrics. We expanded operating gross margin by 140 basis points and operating pretax margin by 110 basis points, inclusive of 150 basis point currency headwind to pretax margin. Currency impacted operating pretax profit growth in the quarter by over $200 million. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage and ongoing productivity initiatives, which allowed for continued investments to drive innovation in our portfolio. You can see this in our higher R&D expense. Our operating tax rate was 14%, which is flat versus last year and our operating earnings per share of $3.87 was up 8%. We remain laser-focused on our productivity initiatives as we digitally transform our business processes and scale AI within IBM. This includes simplifying our application and infrastructure environments, streamlining our supply chain, aligning our teams by workflow, reducing our real estate footprint, and enabling a higher value-added workforce through automation and AI-driven efficiencies. Against a target of $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024, which I mentioned back in April of last year, we have already achieved over $1.5 billion. Our productivity initiatives have allowed us to increase our investments in innovation, technical and industry skills and go-to-market capabilities, including our ecosystem. And we have accomplished this while simultaneously growing our profit margin and free cash flow, which in turn has increased our financial flexibility. This remains our playbook going forward. And given our success to date, we now believe we can achieve at least $3 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. Overall, the combination of our revenue and margin performance resulted in 9% growth in our operating pretax profit for the quarter. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the year, we generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow, up $1.9 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this growth comes from $900 million of adjusted EBITDA. For better transparency, we have included a view of our adjusted EBITDA performance in our supplemental slides. Our free cash flow growth also reflects benefits of about $400 million from working capital efficiencies, which is consistent with what we've been suggesting throughout the year. CapEx was also down about $400 million, reflecting actions to optimize our real estate portfolio. These actions reduced our net CapEx although had limited benefit to our profit performance. In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested over $5 billion to acquire nine companies, and we returned over $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with a strong liquidity position with cash of $13.5 billion, which is up $4.6 billion year-over-year. Total debt is up $5.6 billion over the same period. And our debt balance ended the year at $56.5 billion, including approximately $12 billion of debt associated with our financing business. Our retirement-related plans remain in a strong financial position. At year-end, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are funded at 111% with the U.S. at 123%. Turning to our segments. Software grew 2% with growth across both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. This quarter's performance, again, reflects growth in our high-value recurring revenue base, which is up mid-single digits. I'll remind you this comprises about 80% of our annual software revenue. Transaction processing with its strong base of recurring revenue delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms like zSystems. This, together with price increases, contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in transaction processing for the year. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 1%. Within this performance, Red Hat revenue was up 7%, automation was flat, Data & AI was up 1% and security declined. Looking across Hybrid Platform & Solutions. The strength of our recurring base of business is evident in our ARR, now $14.4 billion and up over 7% since last year. We also faced a tough compare here in the fourth quarter, wrapping on seasonally strong transactional performance, including strength in ELAs, as we discussed at the start of the year. What played out in the fourth quarter reflects just these dynamics. And while transactional revenue overall was significant, it was down year-to-year a little more than expected. In Red Hat, revenue performance was similar to last quarter as we continue to see dampened growth in consumption-based services. Our future growth indicators are encouraging. Red Hat annual bookings were up 17%, including double-digit bookings growth across all 3 key offerings: RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible. Renewals have been strong this quarter with our NRR up well over 100% and up 6 points over last year. And OpenShift continued its strong performance with annual recurring revenue of $1.2 billion. Beyond OpenShift, our platform-based approach is resonating with clients. We're seeing growing interest in our generative AI platform, watsonx, as Arvind touched on earlier. And we've been investing to both extend and expand our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities and software from new offerings in Ansible to the launch of watsonx.governance, to the announced acquisition of Stream Sets and Web Methods. Looking at Software profit. Gross profit margin expanded and pretax margin was flat with the latter reflecting key investments in innovation and about 2 points of currency impact in the quarter. In Consulting, our revenue in the quarter was up 5.5%. We continue to see solid demand for data and technology transformation projects with a focus on AI and analytics. Clients are also prioritizing cloud modernization and cloud-based application development projects. This focus on digital transformation and AI initiatives to drive productivity and cost savings has been consistent throughout the year. Our ability to address these client demands drove signings growth of 8% with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter. That caps off a solid year where signings grew at a high-teens rate. And with this, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15. There has been significant interest this year regarding our consulting outperformance relative to competitors. Let me give you my thoughts on what differentiates us. Our integrated value, investments in skills and strategic partnerships and focused execution. First, we are the only technology company with the consulting business at scale. This unique integrated value proposition helps our clients implement digital transformations and generative AI solutions. Second, we reposition our portfolio to address our clients' top priorities through investments in skills, capabilities and strategic partnerships. Consulting is even more powerful when working in collaboration with our partners. Our strategic partnerships now make up over 40% of our consulting revenue and delivered double-digit growth in both signings and revenue for the full year. Within this performance, our AWS and Azure practices each grew revenue more than 50% for the year. Finally, our solid results throughout the year demonstrate our focus on execution. When you look at our three lines of business in consulting, we have consistently delivered solid revenue performance. Business transformation revenue grew 5% for the third consecutive quarter, again, led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to growth. Technology consulting revenue was up over 4% with growth in cloud modernization projects and cloud-based application development. Application operations revenue grew 6% driven again by cloud application management and platform engineering services with both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements contributing to growth. Moving to consulting profit. We expanded gross margin 30 basis points and delivered pretax margin of 11.5%, which is up 50 basis points year-to-year. Our pretax margin performance continues to reflect the pricing and productivity actions we have taken, offsetting increased labor costs and nearly 1 point of currency impact. In our Infrastructure business, revenue was up 2%, hybrid infrastructure revenue grew 7%, and infrastructure support declined 9%. Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue was up 8%. Now seven quarters into the product cycle, z16 revenue performance has significantly outperformed prior cycles, including the successful z15 cycle. The z16 program incorporates a number of key innovations for our clients, including cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum safe cyber resilience security, energy efficiency and strong reliability and scalability. Clients are increasingly leveraging zSystems for more and more workloads, and that translates to demand for more capacity, which we described in terms of MIPS. In fact, installed MIPS have roughly doubled over the last two cycles. Putting this all together, zSystems remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption but also related software, storage and services. Distributed infrastructure revenue was up 7% with growth across both power and storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10, and storage traction was aligned to the success of the z16 cycle we just mentioned. Infrastructure support revenue declined given our successful hardware performance. Looking at Infrastructure profit. We delivered gross profit and pretax margin expansion. Pretax margin expanded 280 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing over a point of impact from currency. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. As Arvind mentioned, we are now 2/3rds of the way through our midterm model. And so I'd say it's a good time to reflect on what we have accomplished over this period. Let me start with the actions we've taken to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. We aligned our business to a platform-centric model focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Our go-to-market is based on more technical and experiential selling. We opened IBM's ecosystem and strategic partnerships to give our clients greater choice and technical depth and give IBM multiple ways to win across our portfolio. We have invested in innovation and skills and pursued strategic M&A, and we presented a simplified reporting structure to give increased transparency into our performance. These actions resulted in a fundamentally different company with an improved business mix and a higher-value recurring revenue base. Today, our growth vectors of software and consulting represent 75% of our revenue base, up from about 55% in 2020, and our stable recurring revenue stream represents about half of IBM's revenue. As Arvind said, our 2-year average revenue growth is in line with our mid-single-digit model, and our segments have delivered at or above the revenue models. With this backdrop, let me turn to 2024 guidance and our 2 key measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. We expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model. As we start the year, I think it's prudent to assume the low end of that model. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion. Our revenue expectations are underpinned by solid growth in both software and consulting. In software, given our pipeline of business, investment in innovation and the contribution of acquisitions, we expect revenue growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In consulting, our solid signings and book-to-bill ratio support revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% with acceleration throughout the year. Given this growth profile, coupled with our productivity actions, we expect to see well over a point of pretax margin expansion in each of these segments. And then in Infrastructure, as we are entering the year seven quarters into the z16 cycle, we expect 2024 infrastructure revenue to decline. This should drive over a point impact to IBM's overall revenue growth. And given the z cycle dynamics, we expect Infrastructure pretax margin to be lower year-over-year. Bringing it all together with these segment dynamics, we expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point, consistent with what we delivered in 2023. Our tax rate for the year should also be fairly consistent with 2023, and as always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year. For free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion in 2024 driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We will have lower cash requirements driven by changes in our retirement plans, which will be offset by higher CapEx and other balance sheet dynamics. Let me comment on a couple of items that are included in our guidance. First, we are seeing increased productivity in our business, which will lead to workforce rebalancing fairly consistent with 2023 levels. And second, as we remain focused on portfolio optimization, we expect to close the sale of the Weather Company assets in the first quarter. On a full-year basis, we expect this to impact revenue growth by over 0.5 point, and any pretax gain from the transaction will be partially offset by foregone profit. In the first quarter of 2024, the company will realign its management structure to manage these assets outside of the software segment within other divested businesses, which will provide comparability within software on a year-over-year basis. Looking into the first quarter, I'd expect our revenue growth rate to be similar to the full year. For profit, we expect the first half to second half SKU of net income to be fairly consistent with history and first quarter to be a couple of points better than last year's SKU. In summary, we have a durable growth business with strong free cash flow generation. We have made a lot of progress this past year and feel good about our position as we enter 2024. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Jim. As a reminder, supplemental information is provided at the end of this presentation. And please refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nWamsi Mohan: Hi. Thank you. If we look at your cash flow performance, it's really very compelling at $12 billion on your guidance. Jim, could you maybe help us bridge from 2023 to 2024, what are the items that are driving that $12 billion in free cash flow? What's happening with maybe cash taxes within that and working capital? And any other detail that you can help parse out would be great. Thank you so much.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question overall. We're obviously very pleased. The team has executed extremely well in 2023, our strongest free cash flow since 2019, $11.2 billion, up $1.9 billion year-to-year. I think it's important, to your point, before we get to '24, to take a step back a year ago and talk about how we guided the year. And by the way, we've been consistent every quarter about our guidance of about $10.5 billion. The reason I think it's important because it goes right at the heart of your question, which is the quality and sustainability and why we here at IBM had the confidence in the guide of about $12 billion. We said a year ago about $10.5 billion. It was predominantly going to be driven by the improving fundamentals of our business, read that sustainable revenue growth, operating leverage, and that, by the way, is our model $750 million year-to-year. On top of that, remember, we had an opportunity gap coming out of fourth quarter 2022. We said we would get working capital efficiency of $400 million, and then we would have modest structural action tailwind offsetting modest cash tax headwind. That kind of brought it all together, $750-ish million from improving fundamentals of the business, $400 million. Now how did 2023 play out? Number one, the improving fundamentals of our business, we had a very strong second half both on our top line revenue, our portfolio mix, our productivity. And we delivered $900 million of growth and adjusted EBITDA year-to-year, which, by the way, we gave you as far as increased transparency. On top of that, we got the $400 million worth of working capital efficiency, very consistent. Then we've got and we capitalized on all of the productivity actions that we have done. We capitalized on being opportunistic on some real estate rationalization. That's why our CapEx was down about $400 million. By the way, full transparency, that's timing. That was a 2024 item. We got that in 2023, so let's put that aside. And then we've got about $100 million worth of cash tax that came in a little bit better. So I would say, against that, very strong high-quality sustainability that sets the baseline for '24. 2024 really is simple as we said in the prepared remarks. One, we see very consistent growth in the fundamentals of our business around revenue profile, margin and productivity that we will get a similar level of growth year-to-year in adjusted EBITDA. By the way, that's above our model again as I'll state, so that we did $900 million last year, we'll get it again. With that, we will also have benefits from the changes in retirement plans that many of you have written about. But offsetting that, we got higher cash taxes year-to-year, and we've also got CapEx that we are going to continue to invest for the long-term sustainable leadership of this company. So it's really in 2024 entirely driven by the business model of our adjusted EBITDA growth. So thank you, again, Wamsi, for the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please state your question.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot, and good afternoon, everyone. I guess my question will be focused on the software side. When I think about the calendar '24 guide of, I think, slightly above the mid-single-digit medium-term target that you folks have, can you maybe talk about how do I think about the split between organic versus inorganic in '24? And if you could also perhaps unpack, what do you expect to see across some of the key segments like Red Hat -- which I think was somewhat below your expectations in '23 and then also the TPP side would be really helpful. Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay. Amit, thank you. Let me do some of the financial bridges year-over-year then turn it over to Arvind and talk about the portfolio, the competitiveness, the innovation and why we feel very confident overall. When you look at our guide, by the way, an acceleration from 2023, I would first start with full year last year, we were very pleased with our software performance, over 5% growth year-over-year. And on a 2-year CGR against our mid-single-digit model, we're at the high end of that model. So when you look at our guide, we feel confident in the level of innovation we've been bringing in, but I would break that guide down mathematically into about 3 or 4 different buckets. Number one, I think we've proven over the last 2 years that we have rebuilt and repositioned our portfolio, and we now have a high-value recurring revenue stream that can grow in this business, offer the innovation and the success of our hardware platform business. That's about 2 points of growth of slightly above the mid-single digit model of software. So 2 points based on credibility of our sustained growth in the high-value recurring revenue. Number two, you talked about acquisitions. We are going to continue to invest and fuel investment into our software portfolio to improve the innovation, the synergistic value, the strategic fit, the hybrid cloud and AI. You saw we closed very excited off to a great start with Apptio, and we announced the acquisition of Web Methods and Stream Sets. Acquisitions will probably give us a little bit less than 2 points of that growth in 2024. So 2 points from high-value recurring revenue, a little bit less than 2 points of acquisition and then Red Hat, to your point. We actually delivered about what we said in fourth quarter. We said high single digit. We still got impacted by consumption-based services. By the way, we'll start wrapping on that later in 2024. But we're extremely excited about the acceleration of demand in our single-year bookings in our subscription book of business, 14% growth in third quarter, 17% growth in fourth quarter. Red Hat will give us about 2.5 points of growth year-over-year. And then the remaining 0.5 point is our continued growth of our transaction processing, and that's about 0.5 point. You add those up, you're over 6% growth, and I think we feel pretty good. But let me turn it over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. And Amit, the second part of that is all of the innovation that we are delivering. When we play it up against the demands in the marketplace, our AI platform is going to be a part of what fuels innovation. And as I think you all understand when people like one part of the portfolio, they tend to also leverage other parts of the portfolio. Other than the AI portfolio automation, which really helps our clients with productivity, Jim mentioned Apptio or Apptio, Turbonomic the whole category called AIOps in the market, we believe, is going to be a big driver of demand for us. And on the mainframe, let's remember, TP does get driven by increased MIPS, and Jim talked about the increased MIPS that are out there. Those MIPS, coupled with the innovation we do in that part of the portfolio, drive the growth. So it's very well balanced. You have M&A, you have Red Hat innovation, you have AI innovation, automation innovation and TP innovation. And that is really what comes together to give us that growth and give us the confidence of being able to deliver all of that growth.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please state your question.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I have one clarification and one question, please. So just on the free cash flow, Jim, I'm wondering, can you give us a bridge from net income, which I think The Street is expecting is about $9 billion or a little over for fiscal '24 and how you get to $12 billion in free cash flow, not from 2023 levels but from net income levels? And maybe in that, can you just clarify how much do you expect depreciation expense to be? And how much do you expect CapEx to be and how big a contributor is that? And then secondly, on the AI book of business, I think you said low hundreds of millions that doubled. So should we be thinking $300 million to $400 million? And it sounds like a third was in software. Was that revenue recognized during the quarter? And then the other couple of hundred millions were consulting signings? Can you just elaborate specifically on exactly what the book of business means?\nJim Kavanaugh: Okay, Toni. Let me take the first piece, and I appreciate the question as always, and then Arvind can talk about the AI overall. For increased transparency, by the way, coming out of third quarter, where we delivered free cash flow of $1 billion up year-over-year, Arvind and I and many other of the senior leaders, we've spent a tremendous amount of time with our investors. And our investors were actually guiding us, coaching us around giving increased transparency about the drivers right at the heart of your question. That's why we put in both the press release and in the supplemental earnings chart a bridge down from operating pretax income down to adjusted PTI. Why? As I stated in Wamsi's question, for depicting the quality and sustainability of our free cash flow. So when you look at 2024, so to your point, I'll leave '23 aside. When you look at '24, it's entirely going to be driven, and more by the growth in adjusted EBITDA. And when you look at net income and you break it down, there's not that much difference between net income overall and the adjusted EBITDA overall. So the $900 million is purely a function of the confidence we have in the portfolio, the mix, the scale, the operating leverage and the productivity, which you heard on the prepared remarks, we took up to $3 billion here as an annual exit run rate by the end of 2024. So it's an entirely driven balance sheet. We'll have dynamics going one way or the other, cash tax modest headwind but those all kind of wash out. It's going to be entirely driven by the business fundamentals.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. So Toni, on the AI book of business, this is not all revenue in the quarter. I would just begin with that statement to set it straight. At this stage, we wanted to start looking at what is our momentum, what is the sentiment from our clients. So we went to a measure that is more reflective of, I'll use the word signings. What is the commitment the clients are making to us? Consulting is straightforward. It is the signings. Consulting signings are anywhere from 12 to 24 months on average is how much time they play out over there. And on software, it's what they're committing to. And we are using SaaS ACV. So it's a 12-month commitment, which is typical for as a service as well as, since we do offer our portfolio both ways as license or as a service, it includes the license piece as well. Now over a long-term, let's call it a couple of years or more, yes, the book of business should turn into an amount of revenue in a quarter, but that's going to take a bit of time to catch up. But we felt that this gives the better indicator right now of what is our traction and what is our acceleration in that part of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Great. Hey, thanks a lot. Wanted to ask about consulting. And Jim, you mentioned and disclosed high teens bookings growth in 2023 and just at 8% off a pretty difficult comp. I was wondering how that's going to play out in terms of revenue yields in '24 and into '25. Does that give you more confidence that the second half of '24 is going to have a pickup in Consulting revenue reported? And then for Arvind, if I could just sneak more on consulting. Your top competitor has much easier comps in terms of bookings and revenue over the next 12 months. Do you think you could continue to outperform them in the next year? Thanks.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Ben. Really appreciate your question [Technical Difficulty], consulting-based question. I think the team is executing extremely well in the marketplace. And as we talked about in prepared remarks, there's real synergistic value of consulting in a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. I think you've seen that play out. When you look at it, yes, we had a very strong year, relatively speaking, in the marketplace around consulting in 2023. Signings growth 17%, book-to-bill over 1.15, our absolute backlog is up 8%, the strongest we've had in quite some time, by the way, stable erosion and duration is up slightly, which we expect as clients do more and more application modernization, those are long tails. So when you look at that profile and you look at how we enter 2024, we take a look at that backlog. We do our backlog runouts. We look at how much of that comes out of our waterfall of the backlog realization and how much actual sell and bill activity you got to do in the year, and that gives us confidence. We guided full year to 6% to 8%. We also said that we expect, just based on those backlog realization trends albeit a lot of work still to get done in '24. But based on those backlog realization trends, we see an acceleration growth path throughout 2024. And that tailwind into 2025, we're well in front of our skis now. And by the way, backlog, when you look at 2025, the predictor indicator is only about third of that backlog sits in '25. As we enter right now in '24, about 2/3rds is backlog-driven. And that still looks pretty healthy growth compared to what our model looks like. So we feel pretty good about our book of business and the strategic partnership velocity, the Red Hat velocity. So I would leave it at that. Let me turn it over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. So Ben, as opposed to trying to directly compare with 1 other or 2 other people, can I take it back to the market, if you don't mind. The overall consulting market seems to be in the 4% to 6% range. So we benchmark there to make sure that we're trying to take share and that we have the offerings which appeal to clients, which also allow us to keep a healthy margin in the business. So when we look at it from those 2 lenses, we are going to be absolutely focused on taking share, which is why we are guiding to a higher 6% to 8% number is where we feel it will be. Then we go back to do we have the bookings that justify that? Yes, the booking is justified. But as you all know, that is some but not all of the revenue in the year. So we feel it's prudent to then guide it into the 6% to 8%, not higher. So you combine it with the offerings we have, we are also very, very focused compared to many of the players out there who are much larger. We are very focused on our strategic partners, and we are very focused on digital transformation and data and AI as opposed to a much broader swath of offerings that other people have. That gives us confidence in our growth rate, as Jim pointed out, for our Consulting business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please state your question.\nBrent Thill: Thanks. Arvind, I'm just curious if you could just give us your view of the business climate, just how things are feeling in the last quarter versus quarters before we're continuing to hear of a defund some of these software budgets from CIOs. And I'm just curious if you're hearing and seeing the same thing that we're seeing in our work.\nArvind Krishna: Yes, Brent. So let me address that. I'll begin by saying, I see '24 playing out quite similar to '23. While there has been a lot of talk about reduced software budgets and reduced technology budgets overall, we are not seeing that. We are seeing that people are a bit more discriminating in what they're spending on. But that is as is spending more on AI, more on digital transformation, and I'll come to why it might mean that they are sort of focusing less on some other areas. So why is that? We see that there is a remarkably resilient economy. We can see that across South Asia from India to Japan, to the Middle East. Europe has kept remarkably resilient despite the conflict in Eastern Europe. Then when we come to North America, the economy here is resilient. Latin America, despite some early predictions, has actually done quite well. You put that all together, look, we don't forecast GDP. We just look at what other people forecast, and all of them are forecasting in the 2% range, 2%, 2.3%, same difference from our perspective. Then if you look at some of the pressures our CEO clients face, whether it's interest rates, whether it's inflation, whether it's supply chain, whether it's the demographic shifts on population, whether it's political conflicts or uncertainty, one answer that lets them grow without taking on fixed costs of either labor or physical infrastructure is technology. So we see every one of them leaning into technology as a potential answer that helps them against all of those potential headwinds. And so we feel pretty good that technology budgets should stay in line with 2023 going into '24.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.\nErik Woodring: Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to dig into the software results a bit. And that was if we maybe set aside Red Hat, which we've spoken about, some of the other businesses continue to decelerate, especially looking at something like Data & AI or automation, especially in this climate of AI and a focus on spending there. I'm just curious, what is driving the confidence that those businesses reaccelerate? Is it customer conversations? I'd love if you could just give a bit more detail, one on, again, what happened in 4Q and kind of how you parse through some of that deceleration across those businesses. And then two, again, what's underscoring the confidence that some of these businesses then reaccelerate into next year? Thanks so much.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Let's start with the bigger picture. all we laid out a midterm model. We set our software portfolio would grow mid the way coming from a prior cycle that we were very low single digits overall. And we finished this year up over 5%. We finished a 2-year CGR already 2/3rds into our model at the high end of the model at 6%. Is that our aspiration? Absolutely not is what Arvind has the entire team focused on. And that's why we continue to fuel investment into new innovation both organically and organically. But let's take a step back how we set the year up. We set the year up, we said the year was going to be predominantly driven by the strength of our recurring revenue annuity portfolio, which, by the way, high value, 80% of our software revenue. That's our subscription-based models, our SaaS models, our TP software, et cetera. And we said that was going to grow mid-single digit. We actually delivered on that. We said then, second, prudently coming off of a peak ELA cycle, and you understand our ELA cycle extremely well in 4Q '22 that we expected a headwind. Now let's go back 90 days ago. 90 days ago, we were sitting year-to-date 6.5% total software segment, which gave us the confidence of taking up our guidance to the high end of the mid-single-digit model. What was driving that? Both HP&S was up 7%, TP was up 6% and underneath that, we were seeing very solid growth in our transactional business both volume and NRR with new clients. Now we get the fourth quarter and the ELA rep hit us. By the way, the ELA cycles give or take, they're in these ranges. They're on average about 3 years. They get probably somewhere around 40 to 50-plus percent in year 1, and then it tails off. So it's the biggest impact we'll see. We got through that in the fourth quarter, and we still delivered over 5% on a 2-year CGR, we're at the high end of the model. Now when you look at full year performance, Red Hat up 9%, automation, I'm directionally correct, 4% or 5%, Data & AI, 4% or 5%, security, yes, we got an execution gap on security. We got an opportunity to go fix in 2024. So I think it's actually glass half full. The innovation we're fueling in organically, the M&A portfolio, which is scaling nicely with a strategic fit, that gives us the confidence on why we're actually taking up and accelerating our growth in light of Brent's question in 2024.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.\nMatt Swanson: Yes. Thank you guys so much. Congratulations on both the free cash flow and then also obviously the free cash flow going into next year. Maybe focusing even more so on the Software side and just thinking so on that 2.5 points of growth that's expected to come from the Red Hat. I mean you've talked about the consulting strength that you're hearing around both cloud and application modernization. Are there any other signs you're hearing specifically from like pipeline or customer conversations about an improving demand environment for Red Hat specifically? And then maybe just as like a caveat, how maybe some of the cloud cost optimizations impacted Red Hat in 2023?\nArvind Krishna: Yes. Matt, let me take that. So when we look at Red Hat, while there are many products in the portfolio, 3 are the pulps that drive the forward performance. So Red Hat Linux, as we look at the overall usage of Linux, as we look at customers being even more concerned about patching, security and making sure that hackers can't break into their infrastructure and we look at the share volatility that happens, I'll call it, in the unfitted open-source world, it drives a lot of demand for Red Hat. And we're beginning see not just enterprise customers but even many ISVs begin to embrace that. As we look at OpenShift, I go back to a fundamental. I think most of our clients now acknowledge that a hybrid environment is their reality, meaning multiple public clouds and their own data centers are private. In that environment, OpenShift is the leading platform that gives them the flexibility to take an application and run it across all of those. And in this day and age when people have thousands of applications and the ones they're ready to deploy without having thousands of people, it has to go give them the platform to go do that. Those three combined roll up into the 17% increase in bookings that Jim referenced on the call. So that's not a leading indicator that is actually already done. Now with 14% in the previous quarter, that tells us the acceleration happening on that side. And we feel confident given the client conversations that these are all going to lead to Red Hat growth, putting aside the innovation that's coming from the edge platforms, from embedded Red Hat and from other markets that as the edge opens up or create yet again another additional market that has to come. So this gives us confidence that Red Hat will grow and provide that 2 to 2.5 points of overall software.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Please state your question.\nBrian Essex: Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Maybe for Jim. With regard to acquisitions, could you maybe provide some color or an update on your pipeline and offer maybe an update on your philosophy behind M&A, how you assess transactions with regard to the level of accretion you might require or what they might contribute to top line revenue growth or how they might improve ROIC long-term?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, sure. I appreciate that, Brian. Thank you very much. I mean, I think Arvind has been very clear for the last 3.5, 4 years since he's come on. First of all, let's talk criteria. We always get asked size this, size that. Size is not a criteria. It is entirely, and I complement him and the entire team, he's very focused on strategic fit to a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. Those targeted areas are always centered around hybrid cloud, data, automation, security and oh, by the way, both software IP asset and consulting expertise on both sides. So strategic fit. Second, we run this platform-centric model to create a synergistic multiplier effect in our business. So when we look at every single week a set of targeted candidates, we're looking at the synergistic effect because as a CFO, when we deploy $1, we're looking for a multiplier of hardware, software services on top of that. And then third, financial attractiveness. It has to be high growth, recurring revenue, highly profitable and free cash flow accretion in a quick period of time. That will vary based on software, it will vary based on consulting. But I think you're going to continue to see us be opportunistic in the marketplace. We've got the right capital structure. We've got the right finflex. We ended with, what, $13.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we feel pretty good about our position, and we will capitalize on that to the extent it hits and fits those criteria. So thank you for the question.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. Let me now wrap up the call. In 2023, we executed on our strategy to deliver sustained revenue growth and cash generation. The changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years and our performance reinforce my confidence as we move into 2024. I look forward to continuing this dialogue through the year.\nOlympia McNerney: Diego, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. In the fourth quarter, we delivered $17.4 billion in revenue, $4.2 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $3.87, and we generated $6.1 billion of free cash flow. This wrapped up another solid year, where we continue to deliver durable growth in our repositioned business aligned with client priorities of digital transformation and driving productivity. Taking a step back, let me touch on a full year before I go into additional details of the quarter. Our revenue for the year was nearly $62 billion, up 3% and in line with our expectation 90 days ago. We generated $10.3 billion of operating pretax income and operating earnings per share of $9.62. Our free cash flow was $11.2 billion, our strongest level of cash generation since 2019. Revenue performance for the year was again led by software and consulting. Software grew by over 5% with good growth across Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. Consulting revenue was up over 6% with solid growth every quarter and broad-based growth across all 3 lines of business, highlighting the durability of our results and differentiated client offerings. Infrastructure was down 4%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Our revenue growth and productivity initiatives led to margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. For the full year, we expanded operating gross profit margin by 130 basis points with every segment growing margin across every quarter. Our operating pretax margin expanded by 40 basis points, in line with our expectations and driven by strong productivity gains and operating leverage. And this includes a 110-basis point headwind from currency dynamics. Now turning to a deeper dive on the quarter. Our revenue was up over 3%. Software revenue was up 2%. Our fourth quarter performance reflects continued growth in our recurring revenue and a wrap on last year's seasonally strong transactional performance. Consulting had another solid quarter with 5.5% revenue growth, which is a sequential improvement in the growth rate. We had good signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio over 1.15. This continued momentum in consulting is reflective of how we work with clients, the investment we are making in skills and talent, velocity in our strategic partnerships, and our integrated value proposition. We had great Infrastructure performance this quarter. Revenue was up 2% with growth in both zSystems and distributed infrastructure. This performance is particularly notable given it's the seventh quarter of the z16 cycle and in our seasonally largest quarter, again, highlighting the innovation we are bringing to this mission-critical platform. Looking at our profit metrics. We expanded operating gross margin by 140 basis points and operating pretax margin by 110 basis points, inclusive of 150 basis point currency headwind to pretax margin. Currency impacted operating pretax profit growth in the quarter by over $200 million. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage and ongoing productivity initiatives, which allowed for continued investments to drive innovation in our portfolio. You can see this in our higher R&D expense. Our operating tax rate was 14%, which is flat versus last year and our operating earnings per share of $3.87 was up 8%. We remain laser-focused on our productivity initiatives as we digitally transform our business processes and scale AI within IBM. This includes simplifying our application and infrastructure environments, streamlining our supply chain, aligning our teams by workflow, reducing our real estate footprint, and enabling a higher value-added workforce through automation and AI-driven efficiencies. Against a target of $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024, which I mentioned back in April of last year, we have already achieved over $1.5 billion. Our productivity initiatives have allowed us to increase our investments in innovation, technical and industry skills and go-to-market capabilities, including our ecosystem. And we have accomplished this while simultaneously growing our profit margin and free cash flow, which in turn has increased our financial flexibility. This remains our playbook going forward. And given our success to date, we now believe we can achieve at least $3 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. Overall, the combination of our revenue and margin performance resulted in 9% growth in our operating pretax profit for the quarter. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the year, we generated $11.2 billion of free cash flow, up $1.9 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this growth comes from $900 million of adjusted EBITDA. For better transparency, we have included a view of our adjusted EBITDA performance in our supplemental slides. Our free cash flow growth also reflects benefits of about $400 million from working capital efficiencies, which is consistent with what we've been suggesting throughout the year. CapEx was also down about $400 million, reflecting actions to optimize our real estate portfolio. These actions reduced our net CapEx although had limited benefit to our profit performance. In terms of cash uses for the year, we invested over $5 billion to acquire nine companies, and we returned over $6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. Looking at the balance sheet. We ended the year with a strong liquidity position with cash of $13.5 billion, which is up $4.6 billion year-over-year. Total debt is up $5.6 billion over the same period. And our debt balance ended the year at $56.5 billion, including approximately $12 billion of debt associated with our financing business. Our retirement-related plans remain in a strong financial position. At year-end, our worldwide tax-qualified plans are funded at 111% with the U.S. at 123%. Turning to our segments. Software grew 2% with growth across both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. This quarter's performance, again, reflects growth in our high-value recurring revenue base, which is up mid-single digits. I'll remind you this comprises about 80% of our annual software revenue. Transaction processing with its strong base of recurring revenue delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms like zSystems. This, together with price increases, contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in transaction processing for the year. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 1%. Within this performance, Red Hat revenue was up 7%, automation was flat, Data & AI was up 1% and security declined. Looking across Hybrid Platform & Solutions. The strength of our recurring base of business is evident in our ARR, now $14.4 billion and up over 7% since last year. We also faced a tough compare here in the fourth quarter, wrapping on seasonally strong transactional performance, including strength in ELAs, as we discussed at the start of the year. What played out in the fourth quarter reflects just these dynamics. And while transactional revenue overall was significant, it was down year-to-year a little more than expected. In Red Hat, revenue performance was similar to last quarter as we continue to see dampened growth in consumption-based services. Our future growth indicators are encouraging. Red Hat annual bookings were up 17%, including double-digit bookings growth across all 3 key offerings: RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible. Renewals have been strong this quarter with our NRR up well over 100% and up 6 points over last year. And OpenShift continued its strong performance with annual recurring revenue of $1.2 billion. Beyond OpenShift, our platform-based approach is resonating with clients. We're seeing growing interest in our generative AI platform, watsonx, as Arvind touched on earlier. And we've been investing to both extend and expand our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities and software from new offerings in Ansible to the launch of watsonx.governance, to the announced acquisition of Stream Sets and Web Methods. Looking at Software profit. Gross profit margin expanded and pretax margin was flat with the latter reflecting key investments in innovation and about 2 points of currency impact in the quarter. In Consulting, our revenue in the quarter was up 5.5%. We continue to see solid demand for data and technology transformation projects with a focus on AI and analytics. Clients are also prioritizing cloud modernization and cloud-based application development projects. This focus on digital transformation and AI initiatives to drive productivity and cost savings has been consistent throughout the year. Our ability to address these client demands drove signings growth of 8% with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio in the quarter. That caps off a solid year where signings grew at a high-teens rate. And with this, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15. There has been significant interest this year regarding our consulting outperformance relative to competitors. Let me give you my thoughts on what differentiates us. Our integrated value, investments in skills and strategic partnerships and focused execution. First, we are the only technology company with the consulting business at scale. This unique integrated value proposition helps our clients implement digital transformations and generative AI solutions. Second, we reposition our portfolio to address our clients' top priorities through investments in skills, capabilities and strategic partnerships. Consulting is even more powerful when working in collaboration with our partners. Our strategic partnerships now make up over 40% of our consulting revenue and delivered double-digit growth in both signings and revenue for the full year. Within this performance, our AWS and Azure practices each grew revenue more than 50% for the year. Finally, our solid results throughout the year demonstrate our focus on execution. When you look at our three lines of business in consulting, we have consistently delivered solid revenue performance. Business transformation revenue grew 5% for the third consecutive quarter, again, led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to growth. Technology consulting revenue was up over 4% with growth in cloud modernization projects and cloud-based application development. Application operations revenue grew 6% driven again by cloud application management and platform engineering services with both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements contributing to growth. Moving to consulting profit. We expanded gross margin 30 basis points and delivered pretax margin of 11.5%, which is up 50 basis points year-to-year. Our pretax margin performance continues to reflect the pricing and productivity actions we have taken, offsetting increased labor costs and nearly 1 point of currency impact. In our Infrastructure business, revenue was up 2%, hybrid infrastructure revenue grew 7%, and infrastructure support declined 9%. Within hybrid infrastructure, zSystems revenue was up 8%. Now seven quarters into the product cycle, z16 revenue performance has significantly outperformed prior cycles, including the successful z15 cycle. The z16 program incorporates a number of key innovations for our clients, including cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum safe cyber resilience security, energy efficiency and strong reliability and scalability. Clients are increasingly leveraging zSystems for more and more workloads, and that translates to demand for more capacity, which we described in terms of MIPS. In fact, installed MIPS have roughly doubled over the last two cycles. Putting this all together, zSystems remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption but also related software, storage and services. Distributed infrastructure revenue was up 7% with growth across both power and storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10, and storage traction was aligned to the success of the z16 cycle we just mentioned. Infrastructure support revenue declined given our successful hardware performance. Looking at Infrastructure profit. We delivered gross profit and pretax margin expansion. Pretax margin expanded 280 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing over a point of impact from currency. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. As Arvind mentioned, we are now 2/3rds of the way through our midterm model. And so I'd say it's a good time to reflect on what we have accomplished over this period. Let me start with the actions we've taken to execute our strategy and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. We aligned our business to a platform-centric model focused on hybrid cloud and AI. Our go-to-market is based on more technical and experiential selling. We opened IBM's ecosystem and strategic partnerships to give our clients greater choice and technical depth and give IBM multiple ways to win across our portfolio. We have invested in innovation and skills and pursued strategic M&A, and we presented a simplified reporting structure to give increased transparency into our performance. These actions resulted in a fundamentally different company with an improved business mix and a higher-value recurring revenue base. Today, our growth vectors of software and consulting represent 75% of our revenue base, up from about 55% in 2020, and our stable recurring revenue stream represents about half of IBM's revenue. As Arvind said, our 2-year average revenue growth is in line with our mid-single-digit model, and our segments have delivered at or above the revenue models. With this backdrop, let me turn to 2024 guidance and our 2 key measures of success: revenue growth and free cash flow. We expect constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model. As we start the year, I think it's prudent to assume the low end of that model. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion. Our revenue expectations are underpinned by solid growth in both software and consulting. In software, given our pipeline of business, investment in innovation and the contribution of acquisitions, we expect revenue growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In consulting, our solid signings and book-to-bill ratio support revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% with acceleration throughout the year. Given this growth profile, coupled with our productivity actions, we expect to see well over a point of pretax margin expansion in each of these segments. And then in Infrastructure, as we are entering the year seven quarters into the z16 cycle, we expect 2024 infrastructure revenue to decline. This should drive over a point impact to IBM's overall revenue growth. And given the z cycle dynamics, we expect Infrastructure pretax margin to be lower year-over-year. Bringing it all together with these segment dynamics, we expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point, consistent with what we delivered in 2023. Our tax rate for the year should also be fairly consistent with 2023, and as always, the timing of discrete items can cause the rate to vary within the year. For free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion in 2024 driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We will have lower cash requirements driven by changes in our retirement plans, which will be offset by higher CapEx and other balance sheet dynamics. Let me comment on a couple of items that are included in our guidance. First, we are seeing increased productivity in our business, which will lead to workforce rebalancing fairly consistent with 2023 levels. And second, as we remain focused on portfolio optimization, we expect to close the sale of the Weather Company assets in the first quarter. On a full-year basis, we expect this to impact revenue growth by over 0.5 point, and any pretax gain from the transaction will be partially offset by foregone profit. In the first quarter of 2024, the company will realign its management structure to manage these assets outside of the software segment within other divested businesses, which will provide comparability within software on a year-over-year basis. Looking into the first quarter, I'd expect our revenue growth rate to be similar to the full year. For profit, we expect the first half to second half SKU of net income to be fairly consistent with history and first quarter to be a couple of points better than last year's SKU. In summary, we have a durable growth business with strong free cash flow generation. We have made a lot of progress this past year and feel good about our position as we enter 2024. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started. Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question overall. We're obviously very pleased. The team has executed extremely well in 2023, our strongest free cash flow since 2019, $11.2 billion, up $1.9 billion year-to-year. I think it's important, to your point, before we get to '24, to take a step back a year ago and talk about how we guided the year. And by the way, we've been consistent every quarter about our guidance of about $10.5 billion. The reason I think it's important because it goes right at the heart of your question, which is the quality and sustainability and why we here at IBM had the confidence in the guide of about $12 billion. We said a year ago about $10.5 billion. It was predominantly going to be driven by the improving fundamentals of our business, read that sustainable revenue growth, operating leverage, and that, by the way, is our model $750 million year-to-year. On top of that, remember, we had an opportunity gap coming out of fourth quarter 2022. We said we would get working capital efficiency of $400 million, and then we would have modest structural action tailwind offsetting modest cash tax headwind. That kind of brought it all together, $750-ish million from improving fundamentals of the business, $400 million. Now how did 2023 play out? Number one, the improving fundamentals of our business, we had a very strong second half both on our top line revenue, our portfolio mix, our productivity. And we delivered $900 million of growth and adjusted EBITDA year-to-year, which, by the way, we gave you as far as increased transparency. On top of that, we got the $400 million worth of working capital efficiency, very consistent. Then we've got and we capitalized on all of the productivity actions that we have done. We capitalized on being opportunistic on some real estate rationalization. That's why our CapEx was down about $400 million. By the way, full transparency, that's timing. That was a 2024 item. We got that in 2023, so let's put that aside. And then we've got about $100 million worth of cash tax that came in a little bit better. So I would say, against that, very strong high-quality sustainability that sets the baseline for '24. 2024 really is simple as we said in the prepared remarks. One, we see very consistent growth in the fundamentals of our business around revenue profile, margin and productivity that we will get a similar level of growth year-to-year in adjusted EBITDA. By the way, that's above our model again as I'll state, so that we did $900 million last year, we'll get it again. With that, we will also have benefits from the changes in retirement plans that many of you have written about. But offsetting that, we got higher cash taxes year-to-year, and we've also got CapEx that we are going to continue to invest for the long-term sustainable leadership of this company. So it's really in 2024 entirely driven by the business model of our adjusted EBITDA growth. So thank you, again, Wamsi, for the question. Okay. Amit, thank you. Let me do some of the financial bridges year-over-year then turn it over to Arvind and talk about the portfolio, the competitiveness, the innovation and why we feel very confident overall. When you look at our guide, by the way, an acceleration from 2023, I would first start with full year last year, we were very pleased with our software performance, over 5% growth year-over-year. And on a 2-year CGR against our mid-single-digit model, we're at the high end of that model. So when you look at our guide, we feel confident in the level of innovation we've been bringing in, but I would break that guide down mathematically into about 3 or 4 different buckets. Number one, I think we've proven over the last 2 years that we have rebuilt and repositioned our portfolio, and we now have a high-value recurring revenue stream that can grow in this business, offer the innovation and the success of our hardware platform business. That's about 2 points of growth of slightly above the mid-single digit model of software. So 2 points based on credibility of our sustained growth in the high-value recurring revenue. Number two, you talked about acquisitions. We are going to continue to invest and fuel investment into our software portfolio to improve the innovation, the synergistic value, the strategic fit, the hybrid cloud and AI. You saw we closed very excited off to a great start with Apptio, and we announced the acquisition of Web Methods and Stream Sets. Acquisitions will probably give us a little bit less than 2 points of that growth in 2024. So 2 points from high-value recurring revenue, a little bit less than 2 points of acquisition and then Red Hat, to your point. We actually delivered about what we said in fourth quarter. We said high single digit. We still got impacted by consumption-based services. By the way, we'll start wrapping on that later in 2024. But we're extremely excited about the acceleration of demand in our single-year bookings in our subscription book of business, 14% growth in third quarter, 17% growth in fourth quarter. Red Hat will give us about 2.5 points of growth year-over-year. And then the remaining 0.5 point is our continued growth of our transaction processing, and that's about 0.5 point. You add those up, you're over 6% growth, and I think we feel pretty good. But let me turn it over to Arvind. Okay, Toni. Let me take the first piece, and I appreciate the question as always, and then Arvind can talk about the AI overall. For increased transparency, by the way, coming out of third quarter, where we delivered free cash flow of $1 billion up year-over-year, Arvind and I and many other of the senior leaders, we've spent a tremendous amount of time with our investors. And our investors were actually guiding us, coaching us around giving increased transparency about the drivers right at the heart of your question. That's why we put in both the press release and in the supplemental earnings chart a bridge down from operating pretax income down to adjusted PTI. Why? As I stated in Wamsi's question, for depicting the quality and sustainability of our free cash flow. So when you look at 2024, so to your point, I'll leave '23 aside. When you look at '24, it's entirely going to be driven, and more by the growth in adjusted EBITDA. And when you look at net income and you break it down, there's not that much difference between net income overall and the adjusted EBITDA overall. So the $900 million is purely a function of the confidence we have in the portfolio, the mix, the scale, the operating leverage and the productivity, which you heard on the prepared remarks, we took up to $3 billion here as an annual exit run rate by the end of 2024. So it's an entirely driven balance sheet. We'll have dynamics going one way or the other, cash tax modest headwind but those all kind of wash out. It's going to be entirely driven by the business fundamentals. Thanks, Ben. Really appreciate your question [Technical Difficulty], consulting-based question. I think the team is executing extremely well in the marketplace. And as we talked about in prepared remarks, there's real synergistic value of consulting in a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. I think you've seen that play out. When you look at it, yes, we had a very strong year, relatively speaking, in the marketplace around consulting in 2023. Signings growth 17%, book-to-bill over 1.15, our absolute backlog is up 8%, the strongest we've had in quite some time, by the way, stable erosion and duration is up slightly, which we expect as clients do more and more application modernization, those are long tails. So when you look at that profile and you look at how we enter 2024, we take a look at that backlog. We do our backlog runouts. We look at how much of that comes out of our waterfall of the backlog realization and how much actual sell and bill activity you got to do in the year, and that gives us confidence. We guided full year to 6% to 8%. We also said that we expect, just based on those backlog realization trends albeit a lot of work still to get done in '24. But based on those backlog realization trends, we see an acceleration growth path throughout 2024. And that tailwind into 2025, we're well in front of our skis now. And by the way, backlog, when you look at 2025, the predictor indicator is only about third of that backlog sits in '25. As we enter right now in '24, about 2/3rds is backlog-driven. And that still looks pretty healthy growth compared to what our model looks like. So we feel pretty good about our book of business and the strategic partnership velocity, the Red Hat velocity. So I would leave it at that. Let me turn it over to Arvind. Yes. Let's start with the bigger picture. all we laid out a midterm model. We set our software portfolio would grow mid the way coming from a prior cycle that we were very low single digits overall. And we finished this year up over 5%. We finished a 2-year CGR already 2/3rds into our model at the high end of the model at 6%. Is that our aspiration? Absolutely not is what Arvind has the entire team focused on. And that's why we continue to fuel investment into new innovation both organically and organically. But let's take a step back how we set the year up. We set the year up, we said the year was going to be predominantly driven by the strength of our recurring revenue annuity portfolio, which, by the way, high value, 80% of our software revenue. That's our subscription-based models, our SaaS models, our TP software, et cetera. And we said that was going to grow mid-single digit. We actually delivered on that. We said then, second, prudently coming off of a peak ELA cycle, and you understand our ELA cycle extremely well in 4Q '22 that we expected a headwind. Now let's go back 90 days ago. 90 days ago, we were sitting year-to-date 6.5% total software segment, which gave us the confidence of taking up our guidance to the high end of the mid-single-digit model. What was driving that? Both HP&S was up 7%, TP was up 6% and underneath that, we were seeing very solid growth in our transactional business both volume and NRR with new clients. Now we get the fourth quarter and the ELA rep hit us. By the way, the ELA cycles give or take, they're in these ranges. They're on average about 3 years. They get probably somewhere around 40 to 50-plus percent in year 1, and then it tails off. So it's the biggest impact we'll see. We got through that in the fourth quarter, and we still delivered over 5% on a 2-year CGR, we're at the high end of the model. Now when you look at full year performance, Red Hat up 9%, automation, I'm directionally correct, 4% or 5%, Data & AI, 4% or 5%, security, yes, we got an execution gap on security. We got an opportunity to go fix in 2024. So I think it's actually glass half full. The innovation we're fueling in organically, the M&A portfolio, which is scaling nicely with a strategic fit, that gives us the confidence on why we're actually taking up and accelerating our growth in light of Brent's question in 2024. Yes, sure. I appreciate that, Brian. Thank you very much. I mean, I think Arvind has been very clear for the last 3.5, 4 years since he's come on. First of all, let's talk criteria. We always get asked size this, size that. Size is not a criteria. It is entirely, and I complement him and the entire team, he's very focused on strategic fit to a hybrid cloud and AI platform-centric company. Those targeted areas are always centered around hybrid cloud, data, automation, security and oh, by the way, both software IP asset and consulting expertise on both sides. So strategic fit. Second, we run this platform-centric model to create a synergistic multiplier effect in our business. So when we look at every single week a set of targeted candidates, we're looking at the synergistic effect because as a CFO, when we deploy $1, we're looking for a multiplier of hardware, software services on top of that. And then third, financial attractiveness. It has to be high growth, recurring revenue, highly profitable and free cash flow accretion in a quick period of time. That will vary based on software, it will vary based on consulting. But I think you're going to continue to see us be opportunistic in the marketplace. We've got the right capital structure. We've got the right finflex. We ended with, what, $13.5 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So we feel pretty good about our position, and we will capitalize on that to the extent it hits and fits those criteria. So thank you for the question."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us. We had a solid close to 2023 with growth across our businesses and strong cash generation. Our fourth quarter and full year results demonstrate the strength of our portfolio and sustainability of our revenue growth. We are pleased with the progress we made in 2023, delivering revenue growth of 3% and over $11 billion of free cash flow, two-thirds of the way through our midterm model, I am proud of our achievements. Since 2021, we delivered average revenue growth for IBM and for each segment at or above our model. The overall trends we are seeing reinforce our views of the future. We are confident in achieving our midterm revenue model, and the strength of our diversified business model allows us to make progress each quarter. We entered the year intent on enhancing our Software portfolio and strengthening our Consulting position. We have done both. Mid-last year, we launched watsonx, our flagship AI and data platform, and we are excited by the traction we are seeing. Consulting has delivered durable revenue growth through the year despite an uneven macro environment. Our expanding ecosystem, skills and technical expertise, global reach and co-creation approach not only set us apart but also contributed to our consulting performance outpacing that of our competitors. This year also underscored the enduring nature and relevance of our zSystems platform. Before getting into the execution of our strategy, I'll make a few comments about what we see in the current environment. I expect many macro trends to be similar to 2023. Technology demand will continue to be strong and serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth. It allows businesses to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. Every client I speak with is asking about how to boost productivity with AI and how to manage their technology stack, much of which is deployed across a hybrid environment, public, private and on-premises. These trends continue to fuel demand for both hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. I will now provide some color on the progress we are making in the execution of our strategy, starting with AI. Our approach to AI for business is resonating. Earlier in '23, we introduced watsonx, IBM's core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate and deploy AI models. We believe AI will be multi-model with our clients leveraging a combination of models. IBM's, open source, their own proprietary models and those of other companies. Flexibility of deployment is key. Simply put, we meet clients where they are and allow clients to deploy AI models across multiple environments. In the fourth quarter, we released watsonx.governance to help clients and partners govern and instill trust in generative AI. This toolkit helps organizations manage and monitor their AI and prepare for compliance with future AI-related regulations. IBM was recently named a leader in generative AI for governance platforms by IDC. As I have mentioned before, IBM was one of the first companies to announce indemnification of all our models. Additionally, IBM and Meta announced in December the formation of the AI Alliance, a group of 70 industry and academic leaders joining together to advance open, safe and responsible AI. We continue to believe our consulting business will be an early beneficiary of AI. We are the only provider today that offers both the technology stack with our watsonx platform and consulting services for deploying and managing generative AI. The early work for clients around data architecture, security and governance is critical and hard, and we think consulting expertise is going to be crucial here. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful practice around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are on a similar trajectory with generative AI. Consulting is a core driver of our value proposition for clients. Last quarter, I shared with you that our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI and watsonx was in the low hundreds of millions. Since then, demand continues to increase and our book of business in the fourth quarter is roughly double the third quarter amount. We continue to have thousands of hands-on client interactions, including an acceleration in pilots that were completed during the quarter. Software transaction revenue and SaaS ACV was approximately 1/3 of our book of business related to generative AI in the fourth quarter and 2/3 was consulting signings. There was a balance of both large and small transactions across both segments. Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service and digital labor continue to offer meaningful near-term benefits to clients. We've been collaborating with numerous clients using watsonx code assistant for Ansible. This includes a successful pilot with Citi, where initial results point to substantial developer productivity and core quality improvements that have led to plans for a rapid expansion focused on scaling for enterprise-wide outcomes. This is just one of many examples. In other industries, we have done work with clients such as NatWest, Lockheed Martin and Boehringer Ingelheim. We are working on an interesting use case with the Sevilla Football Club using watsonx to find the right players to sign by describing attributes across the database of more than 200,000 scouting reports. As clients build out their AI strategies and focus on driving ROI and productivity, the importance of optimizing IT spend and consumption is magnified. Apptio, our virtual command center for managing technology investments, comes up in nearly all of my client discussions. The value proposition is clearly resonating. Looking beyond AI, we had a number of important client wins in the fourth quarter. For example, we're helping NATO strengthen their cybersecurity posture and build out a customized solution to have greater visibility into cyber threats and respond to them more quickly. We are working with Riyadh Air to help them drive their digital and technology strategy and establish their hybrid cloud integration platform. We also saw meaningful consulting renewals, which combined with new wins highlights the focus and unique strengths of our capabilities. Our strategic partnerships with companies such as SAP, AWS, Microsoft, Salesforce and Adobe continue to expand and thrive. For instance, we are working together with Adobe to embed watsonx into their platform. We also continue to deepen our partnership with SAP through further collaboration across watsonx and Quantum. We also have several new watsonx ISV partners. What we see is clear, many ISVs are eager to work with us as a trusted provider that understands enterprise needs. We continue to invest and bring new innovations to the market in other areas as well. In the quarter, Red Hat enhanced its Ansible automation platform, introducing new offerings like Ansible Light Speed and event-driven Ansible. We announced the availability of Red Hat device edge to manage their workloads and deliver automation at the edge. In quantum computing, we introduced Heron, the most advanced quantum processor; and the System 2, a module of quantum computer. Focusing our portfolio remains a key priority. We completed 9 acquisitions this year, including Apptio, and we recently announced the acquisition of Stream Sets and Web Methods from Software AG, which we expect to close midyear. With respect to divestitures, we announced the sale of our Weather assets, which we expect to close in the first quarter. We also announced the Enterprise AI Venture Fund, a $500 million fund with the goal of partnering with the start-up community to tap into the latest AI innovations in the market and help them scale. In summary, I believe that the changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years position us for the evolving technology landscape. As I reflect on our performance since we presented our midterm model in October of 2021, I am pleased with the progress we have made internally and with our clients. We have delivered average revenue growth for IBM in line with our midterm model and this is true for all our segments. Software has delivered average growth at the high end of the mid-single-digit model. Consulting delivered average growth in line with the high single-digit model and Infrastructure is well ahead of expectations. This performance gives me confidence as we move into the new year. For 2024, we expect performance in line with our mid-term model with mid-single digit revenue growth and about $12 million of free cash flow. This keeps us firmly on a path of sustainable growth. Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter and our expectations for 2024. Jim, over to you. Thanks, Jim. And Amit, the second part of that is all of the innovation that we are delivering. When we play it up against the demands in the marketplace, our AI platform is going to be a part of what fuels innovation. And as I think you all understand when people like one part of the portfolio, they tend to also leverage other parts of the portfolio. Other than the AI portfolio automation, which really helps our clients with productivity, Jim mentioned Apptio or Apptio, Turbonomic the whole category called AIOps in the market, we believe, is going to be a big driver of demand for us. And on the mainframe, let's remember, TP does get driven by increased MIPS, and Jim talked about the increased MIPS that are out there. Those MIPS, coupled with the innovation we do in that part of the portfolio, drive the growth. So it's very well balanced. You have M&A, you have Red Hat innovation, you have AI innovation, automation innovation and TP innovation. And that is really what comes together to give us that growth and give us the confidence of being able to deliver all of that growth. Thanks, Jim. So Toni, on the AI book of business, this is not all revenue in the quarter. I would just begin with that statement to set it straight. At this stage, we wanted to start looking at what is our momentum, what is the sentiment from our clients. So we went to a measure that is more reflective of, I'll use the word signings. What is the commitment the clients are making to us? Consulting is straightforward. It is the signings. Consulting signings are anywhere from 12 to 24 months on average is how much time they play out over there. And on software, it's what they're committing to. And we are using SaaS ACV. So it's a 12-month commitment, which is typical for as a service as well as, since we do offer our portfolio both ways as license or as a service, it includes the license piece as well. Now over a long-term, let's call it a couple of years or more, yes, the book of business should turn into an amount of revenue in a quarter, but that's going to take a bit of time to catch up. But we felt that this gives the better indicator right now of what is our traction and what is our acceleration in that part of the business. Thanks, Jim. So Ben, as opposed to trying to directly compare with 1 other or 2 other people, can I take it back to the market, if you don't mind. The overall consulting market seems to be in the 4% to 6% range. So we benchmark there to make sure that we're trying to take share and that we have the offerings which appeal to clients, which also allow us to keep a healthy margin in the business. So when we look at it from those 2 lenses, we are going to be absolutely focused on taking share, which is why we are guiding to a higher 6% to 8% number is where we feel it will be. Then we go back to do we have the bookings that justify that? Yes, the booking is justified. But as you all know, that is some but not all of the revenue in the year. So we feel it's prudent to then guide it into the 6% to 8%, not higher. So you combine it with the offerings we have, we are also very, very focused compared to many of the players out there who are much larger. We are very focused on our strategic partners, and we are very focused on digital transformation and data and AI as opposed to a much broader swath of offerings that other people have. That gives us confidence in our growth rate, as Jim pointed out, for our Consulting business. Yes, Brent. So let me address that. I'll begin by saying, I see '24 playing out quite similar to '23. While there has been a lot of talk about reduced software budgets and reduced technology budgets overall, we are not seeing that. We are seeing that people are a bit more discriminating in what they're spending on. But that is as is spending more on AI, more on digital transformation, and I'll come to why it might mean that they are sort of focusing less on some other areas. So why is that? We see that there is a remarkably resilient economy. We can see that across South Asia from India to Japan, to the Middle East. Europe has kept remarkably resilient despite the conflict in Eastern Europe. Then when we come to North America, the economy here is resilient. Latin America, despite some early predictions, has actually done quite well. You put that all together, look, we don't forecast GDP. We just look at what other people forecast, and all of them are forecasting in the 2% range, 2%, 2.3%, same difference from our perspective. Then if you look at some of the pressures our CEO clients face, whether it's interest rates, whether it's inflation, whether it's supply chain, whether it's the demographic shifts on population, whether it's political conflicts or uncertainty, one answer that lets them grow without taking on fixed costs of either labor or physical infrastructure is technology. So we see every one of them leaning into technology as a potential answer that helps them against all of those potential headwinds. And so we feel pretty good that technology budgets should stay in line with 2023 going into '24. Yes. Matt, let me take that. So when we look at Red Hat, while there are many products in the portfolio, 3 are the pulps that drive the forward performance. So Red Hat Linux, as we look at the overall usage of Linux, as we look at customers being even more concerned about patching, security and making sure that hackers can't break into their infrastructure and we look at the share volatility that happens, I'll call it, in the unfitted open-source world, it drives a lot of demand for Red Hat. And we're beginning see not just enterprise customers but even many ISVs begin to embrace that. As we look at OpenShift, I go back to a fundamental. I think most of our clients now acknowledge that a hybrid environment is their reality, meaning multiple public clouds and their own data centers are private. In that environment, OpenShift is the leading platform that gives them the flexibility to take an application and run it across all of those. And in this day and age when people have thousands of applications and the ones they're ready to deploy without having thousands of people, it has to go give them the platform to go do that. Those three combined roll up into the 17% increase in bookings that Jim referenced on the call. So that's not a leading indicator that is actually already done. Now with 14% in the previous quarter, that tells us the acceleration happening on that side. And we feel confident given the client conversations that these are all going to lead to Red Hat growth, putting aside the innovation that's coming from the edge platforms, from embedded Red Hat and from other markets that as the edge opens up or create yet again another additional market that has to come. So this gives us confidence that Red Hat will grow and provide that 2 to 2.5 points of overall software. Thanks, Jim. Let me now wrap up the call. In 2023, we executed on our strategy to deliver sustained revenue growth and cash generation. The changes we have made to our business over the last couple of years and our performance reinforce my confidence as we move into 2024. I look forward to continuing this dialogue through the year."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Patricia Murphy, IBM's Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Presentation. As the operator just mentioned, I'm Patricia Murphy, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We've provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thank you for joining us. Before we start, let me address the outbreak of war in Israel. We condemn all acts of terrorism. We are also saddened over the loss of innocent lives and join the global community in the hope that peace and safety can be restored. Let me now turn to our business performance. In the third quarter, we had solid growth across revenue, profit and free cash flow while delivering innovations and positioning our business to capture future opportunities. On the broader trends we are seeing in the market, technology continues to serve as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Businesses and governments around the world are looking for opportunities to address demographic shifts, make their supply chains more resilient and improve sustainability. More recently, geopolitical events and the reality of higher for longer, add to the growing uncertainty. Technology helps organizations better deal with the many challenges they face. We see both tailwinds and headwinds to overall spending. Nearly every business we talk to wants to leverage technology to offer better services, scale more quickly, and fuel growth without increasing their footprint. This has been driving demand for technologies that boost productivity and competitiveness, like hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. Overall, we believe the tailwinds outweigh the headwinds, and technology spend will continue to outpace GDP. In this past quarter, we saw good revenue growth in Software and Consulting. In Infrastructure, more than a year into the product cycle, we continue to see good adoption of z16. Our overall growth reflects our ability to help clients to leverage data and AI for competitive advantage, automate IT environments, and seamlessly integrate hybrid cloud solutions. We also continue to position our business for the future: launching new products and offerings, forging and expanding key partnerships, investing in talent and skills, and focusing our portfolio. We have been taking concrete actions to deliver productivity in our own business. All of this results in an IBM that is aligned to our clients' most pressing needs and has a stronger financial profile. Our third quarter results are another proof point. Typically, at this point, I'd talk about hybrid cloud and the progress we have made. Hybrid cloud remains vitally important to our clients and to our business. Given the inflection in AI and more specifically generative AI, I want to spend more time today on AI and how we're approaching this opportunity. We believe that generative AI will be multi-model, with clients using a combination of IBM's models, other company's models, their own proprietary models and open-source models. This hybrid approach to AI is similar to the hybrid approach to cloud. Let me give you an overview of the capabilities we have been building. Our generative AI software stack starts with Red Hat OpenShift, which serves as the foundation that allows clients to operate in a hybrid environment. Data services help make their data ready for AI. watsonx is the core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate and deploy AI models. We are providing models that address specific domains such as code, language, and cybersecurity, among others. Our AI assistants include the watsonx Code Assistant to augment developers, watsonx Assistant to augment customer service agents and watsonx Orchestrate to augment employees. This quarter, we introduced new AI capabilities for our clients and partners. We unveiled Granite, a multi-billion parameter foundation model on watsonx.ai, which excels in both language and code. We also introduced the watsonx Code Assistant. This includes the watsonx Code Assistant for Z, to help clients accelerate the modernization of mainframe code and apps. It's fueled by a 20-billion parameter model and can, as an example, swiftly translate COBOL to Java. There are hundreds of billions of lines of code written in COBOL, so the opportunity is significant. Looking forward, we plan to launch watsonx.governance before the end of the year, that provides governance tools businesses need to mitigate risks and ensure compliance through the AI lifecycle. This is a key consideration for clients as they go beyond early proof of concepts into real deployments. To bring our AI capabilities to life, we have more than 20,000 data and AI consultants, including a center of excellence for generative AI. Our teams help clients navigate the AI landscape, from crafting a strategy, understanding how AI can be used and deploying AI responsibly. These consultants also provide valuable real-time feedback to our product teams. As in hybrid cloud, our ecosystem across GSIs, ISVs and hyperscalers plays a critical role in bringing generative AI to our clients. In the work we are doing, clear patterns are emerging in terms of the AI enterprise use cases. Based on extensive feedback and trials to date, three have risen to the top. Code modernization, customer service and digital labor all have broad relevance and deliver tangible business benefits. We have also seen this internally, as we apply our AI capabilities to areas such as client support, HR, IT optimization and source-to-pay, to automate a significant portion of tasks and improve the productivity of our people. Our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI was in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. The interest is larger, with thousands of hands-on interactions with our clients. These are across our largest clients and smaller clients, which lays the groundwork for future watsonx opportunities. Let me close the discussion on AI by talking about a couple of client examples. Dun & Bradstreet is leveraging our consulting and software capabilities, fueled by watsonx, to help their clients create proprietary generative AI solutions. IBM and EY also just announced a new solution powered by watsonx Orchestrate, to enhance EY's People Advisory services. We continue to bring innovations to the market in areas other than AI. This includes new innovations to our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform, Red Hat OpenShift, which was recognized recently by both Gartner and Forrester as a leader in container management. We completed the acquisition of Apptio, which complements our IT automation capabilities. In quantum, we are making good progress in building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance and materials. In closing, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We launched our generative AI platform and have good momentum in helping our clients use this important technology. We continue to take portfolio actions to increase our focus on hybrid cloud and AI. And we are applying AI within our own business, improving execution speed and unlocking real value. All of this reinforces my confidence in our future. We're executing a strategy that closely resonates with our clients' needs, and this is propelling our business forward. Three quarters into the year, we are well positioned to deliver on 2023 expectations for both revenue growth and free cash flow. Now, to offer you a more detailed view of our results and the rest of 2023, I'll hand it over to Jim.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights of the quarter. We delivered $14.8 billion of revenue, $2.3 billion of operating pre-tax income, and $2.20 of operating earnings per share. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow. Reported revenue growth was 4.6%. This includes just over 1 point of growth from currency translation, which is significantly less than the currency rates suggested in July. In fact, currency movements over the last 90 days impacted our third quarter revenue by about $250 million. At constant currency, our revenue was up 3.5%. As is typical, I'll focus the discussion on constant currency. Arvind talked about clients' priorities in today's environment, which are driving solid growth in our Software and Consulting offerings. I'll remind you, Software and Consulting are our two growth vectors, and together make up about three quarters of our revenue base. Software revenue was up 6%, as clients leverage their data for insights and automate their IT in a hybrid environment. We had good growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing revenue. Our Consulting business had another solid quarter with 5% revenue growth, strong signings performance, and a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.15 over the last year. We are capitalizing on our continued momentum in the market, as we help clients get value from hybrid cloud and AI and leverage our strategic partnerships. Our Infrastructure revenue was down 3%, with growth in zSystems. More and more we are seeing clients embrace IBM Z in their hybrid cloud environments, especially in regulated industries. This growth was offset by declines in Distributed Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. IBM's revenue growth, together with a good portfolio mix and yield from our productivity initiatives, generated strong margin, profit and free cash flow performance. Operating gross margin expanded 160 basis points, and operating pre-tax margin expanded 170 basis points. Within that PTI margin, we absorbed a year-to-year currency impact of over 150 basis points. Despite that headwind, our margin expansion was broad based, with improvements in every business segment. Driving efficiency and productivity has always been part of our operating and financial models. These ongoing productivity initiatives enable reinvestment in the business, increase financial flexibility and contribute to margin expansion. Our activities range from simplifying our application environment to digitally transforming our business processes by applying AI at scale. We are ahead of pace to achieve our target of $2 billion in annual run-rate savings by the end of 2024. While there is still more to do, I am pleased with our progress. The combination of our revenue and margin performance yielded strong profit growth. Operating pre-tax profit was up 17% to $2.3 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and over $5 billion year-to-date, which is up $1 billion versus last year. Free cash flow growth through the first three quarters was driven primarily by cash sourced from our operating profit performance. We also had working capital efficiencies driven by solid collections. These growth drivers were partially offset by higher performance-based compensation payments earlier in the year. In terms of cash uses, year-to-date we spent about $5 billion on acquisitions and returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. Our resulting cash balance at the end of September was $11 billion. That's up over $2 billion from year-end, but with the acquisition of Apptio in the third quarter, cash is down over $5 billion from June. Our debt balance is now $55 billion, also down from June. Putting this all together, our business fundamentals are solid, with sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion, solid cash generation and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business into the future. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6%, with contribution from Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. This performance reflects growth in both our transactional revenue and our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of our annual Software revenue. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 7% with growth across Red Hat, Automation and Data & AI, as we execute our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Red Hat revenue was up 8%. We continue to deliver good growth in OpenShift and Ansible, both gaining share again this quarter. Clients are committing to our hybrid cloud approach with annual bookings up 14% in the quarter. This includes double-digit growth across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible, partially offset by headwinds in consumption-based services. IT and business automation are top client priorities, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity. This quarter, our Automation revenue grew 13%, with pervasive growth across all business areas. We had strength in AIOps and Management driven by good performance in Instana, Turbonomic and now Apptio as clients look to optimize business outcomes and boost productivity. Data & AI revenue was up 6%. Growth areas include Data Fabric and Customer Care as enterprise clients are both preparing for and adopting generative AI solutions, leveraging watsonx. We also grew in Asset & Supply Chain Management as we help enterprises run sustainable operations. Security revenue declined 3%. We delivered growth in security software driven by Data Security and Identity & Access Management. This was more than offset by declines in managed security services. Looking across these businesses, our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR has grown to $14 billion, up 7% since last year. In Transaction Processing, revenue was up 5%. Throughout this year, we've been talking about how the success of the last couple of zSystems cycles is driving demand for this mission-critical software. This, together with price increases, contributed to year-to-date growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in Transaction Processing. Moving to profit for the Software segment, we expanded gross and pre-tax margins. Our pre-tax margin was up 120 basis points, even while absorbing over 2 points of impact from currency. We continued to deliver operating leverage, driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter. Our Consulting revenue was up 5% with growth across all three lines of business and geographies. With another quarter of strong signings, as I said, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now over 1.15. Clients continue to prioritize transformation projects that enable cost savings and productivity. These results are a proof point that we are well positioned to meet these needs in today's complex environment. IBM's focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy has become even more of a differentiator as clients' interest in generative AI continues to ramp. We are helping clients understand how AI can be used to automate tasks, make better decisions with speed and improve customer experiences. We've made a series of AI announcements over the last few months demonstrating continued advancement of our strategic partnerships. We are providing clients with the opportunity to accelerate their transformation and deploy generative AI responsibly, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners, or a combination. Today, our strategic partnerships account for about 40% of Consulting revenue and have continued to grow double digits across revenue and signings. In aggregate, our hyperscaler partnership revenue was up over 40%, and signings essentially doubled year-to-year. Additionally, our Red Hat practice, which helps clients optimize how they build, deploy and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment has continued to grow at a double-digit rate, with over $1 billion of signings in the quarter. All of what I've just mentioned, from market demand, to how we're positioned and partnering, to our investments to drive growth, is reflected in our overall Consulting revenue performance. You can see that play out across our three lines of business. In Business Transformation, revenue grew 5%, again led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to the growth. In Technology Consulting, revenue was up 1%. Growth in cloud-based application development and modernization work was partially offset by declines in on-prem application-focused projects. In Application Operations, revenue grew 7%, driven by both cloud application management and platform engineering services. In platform engineering, we help clients design an application environment that runs securely and smoothly at scale. Moving to Consulting profit, we expanded gross margin 150 basis points. Pre-tax margin expanded 40 basis points to just over 10%. Our year-to-year margin performance reflects productivity actions we've taken, mitigated by increased labor costs and about 1 point of pre-tax margin impact from currency. Moving to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was down 3%. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue was flat, while Infrastructure Support declined 7%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, zSystems grew 9% in a seasonally smaller revenue quarter. z16 revenue remains well ahead of prior cycles after six quarters of availability. The program strength reflects both growing enterprise workload requirements and the economic value at scale of the platform in traditional processing and Linux consolidation. In fact, installed MIPs capacity for Linux on Z has grown more than four-fold over the last decade. Clients continue to value the security, resiliency and hybrid cloud capabilities of the zSystems platform. Distributed Infrastructure revenue was down 6% as compared to a strong growth in last year of 21% as we introduced innovation across Storage and Power10. This quarter, we had growth in Power offset by declines in Storage. In the Infrastructure segment, we had strong gross and pre-tax margin performance. Pre-tax margin expanded 350 basis points, reflecting benefits from portfolio mix with our zSystems performance and productivity, while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to talk about our expectations before we go to Q&A. Just about two years ago, we introduced Today's IBM, a more focused business with a platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Since then, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and our talent base, and drive productivity across our business. The result is a business that addresses today's client needs, with a stronger financial profile. Our third quarter performance reinforces this progress with 3.5% revenue growth, gross and pre-tax margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Now, with three quarters of the year behind us, we are holding our full year view of our two primary financial metrics, revenue growth and free cash flow. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, that's up $1.2 billion over last year. We've had solid revenue performance all year in our growth vectors of Software and Consulting. We still expect Software revenue growth at the high end of its mid-single digit model, and Consulting revenue in the 6% to 8% range. Infrastructure revenue, of course, reflects product cycle dynamics. In total, with one quarter to go, it's prudent to assume the low end of IBM's 3% to 5% range. We are making great progress in our productivity initiatives. The work we are doing to digitally transform our business not only makes us more nimble by simplifying and streamlining our processes and operations, but it also frees up spend for reinvestment, provides financial flexibility and delivers operating leverage. This contributes to solid margin and free cash flow performance. We continue to expect about a 0.5 point of operating pre-tax margin improvement, and we see a mid-teens tax rate for the year. Our free cash flow performance has been driven primarily from our profit performance. Through the first three quarters, we're up $1 billion year-to-year, and we've delivered nearly 50% of our full year expectation, which is ahead of our historical attainment. While, as always, we are reliant on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve about $10.5 billion for the year. As I look specifically at the fourth quarter, with the recent currency movements, we now see currency to be neutral to a 1-point headwind to revenue growth. That's nearly $600 million worse than 90 days ago. I'd expect constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third. That's despite a tough compare from last year's strong ELA contribution in Software and the large z16 transactional performance in Infrastructure. This demonstrates continued momentum in our underlying business. Bring it all together, we've clearly got a higher-growth, higher-value business with strong cash generation, a business well-positioned for the future. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Patricia, let's get started.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of this presentation. And then, second, I'll try this one last time, but I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions to allow time for more people to participate. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, everyone. And I will stick to Patricia's one last time \"ask one question only\" rule. I guess, Arvind, there's a lot of macro concerns out there to say the least. I'm hoping you could spend a little bit of time just talking about when you talk to your customers and you, I'm sure, engage with a lot of the Fortune 500 companies. Given this macro environment, how are they shifting or prioritizing their IT budget dollars? And I fully understand everything you're talking about generative AI and how beneficial it's going to be, but given the macro environment, given the constrained IT budgets, I guess, where are they taking money away from to fund these investments? I'd love to just understand the customer feedback you're getting and how is the priority changing as they go forward?\nArvind Krishna: Hi, Amit. So, thanks for the question. And it's actually wonderful to talk about this. So, generative AI, just for me to very quickly reiterate the use cases, we found that our clients were really climbing on to on code, on customer service, and on, I'll call it, general digital workers, which is productivity in every enterprise function. So, if you look at code, to a person, every one of the clients said, we don't intend to get rid of any developers, but this allows us to take care of the tech debt that we've accumulated and makes every developer more productive. Amit, I'll kind of point out, most enterprises are very quick to realize, if you are more productive, that means you have a competitive advantage to your peers. And if they have a competitive advantage to their peers, they'll take share without spending more on labor. That's an incredible long-term competitive advantage. When you go to customer service, there is a cost takeout aspect, but it's not 100%. But there is probably a 20% to 30%. If you can have more calls, more chats answered by AI, that means you can have much more volume with a smaller number of people. So, there is both. Also, I'll point out to our audience, AI does not get tired. It doesn't get angry. It doesn't get upset. So, there is a NPS improvement you get along with it. And then on the third one, on digital workers, there likely is a small productivity improvement, but I would call it more in the 4%, 5%, 10%, not 20% 30%, 40%. So, in the macro headwinds you're mentioning, higher interest rates, tougher to get skilled people, all of the issues around the geopolitical uncertainty that causes some of the concern might have caused a pause in some other environments. The AI side, and to be candid, the hybrid cloud side, offers them a way through that without having to decrease their ambitions for next year. And I think we're seeing every one of them play to that. And I think that these are more fundamentals, these are more core processes than some of the other areas that people were worrying about two or three years ago. When two or three years ago, people were worrying a lot about, what do I do to keep all our employees happy? And can I add up all the tools for that? I think there's much less of a focus on that area.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Amit. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Next we will hear from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering if you could comment a little further on the Red Hat deceleration in 3Q. Jim sounded like, was driven partly by consumption-based services that were somewhat weaker. Are you still expecting Red Hat growth in that 11% to 13% range for the year? And can you unpack some of the software elements in the fourth quarter between Red Hat transaction processing and perhaps Apptio? Thank you so much.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yeah, thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're very pleased overall with our Software segment performance growing 8%, actual 6% at constant currency, really led pretty pervasively with growth across the board. Automation led Red Hat at 8%, as you said, and I'll come to that in a second, but data and AI overall. Really underpinning all that is like we said, starting the year: one, a very strong solid recurring revenue base, high value, 80% of that portfolio, by the way, growing mid-single-digit growth, you see that play out in our transaction processing that we call the growth factor; and then also our hybrid platform and solution business, $14 billion ARR that's growing high-single-digit overall. Now within that, you see Red Hat. Red Hat we talked about in the prepared remarks. First of all, Arvind and I would acknowledge, we came in a couple of points below our expectation. And I think that's an execution discussion overall. Embedded in that, where did it come from? It came from -- because I think this is very important, it came from the consumption-based services and offering side of the equation, which by the way is about 20% of our portfolio, shorter duration overall, and it went from last quarter high single digit, which is about what the model is, to low single digit overall. If you look at that and compare that now, let's look at the other part of the portfolio, the remaining 80%. That is our subscription-based business. That's our RHEL franchise, industry market leader, that's Red Hat OpenShift, and that's Ansible. We had a very strong annualized bookings in the quarter, which again, subscription-based business model, we talked about all year long, we were going to be back-end loaded on renewals. We grew that mid-teens overall, including services by the way. If I extract out that 20% portfolio services and just look at the core subscription-based businesses of Red Hat, OpenShift and Ansible, we grew 19% overall. 110%-plus NRR on that renewal rate of that business. And within that 19%, OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40% with RHEL growing double digits. So, putting all that together, I think it's prudent right now when we look at fourth quarter, we're only building into our model -- again, Software at the high end of our segment model, we're only building in high single digit. We have to continue to monitor what happened to us in the third quarter, get the team focused on execution. But I would tell you, just given the signings growth that we posted in the third quarter, and by the way, another good pipeline in the fourth quarter, we feel very confident in the long-term posture of Red Hat growing double digits. We just got to get through and monitor what's happening to us on the services side. So, thanks very much for the question.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Wamsi. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may proceed.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you for taking the question. Jim, it sounds like your guidance for Q4, given you expect revenues at constant currency to be at the low end is somewhere around $17.3 billion, which is quite a bit below normal seasonality despite the fact that you have Apptio and you had strong services signings. So, I'm wondering if you could, a, confirm if that's sort of the number that you're suggesting? And was there some transactional pull forward in mainframe from Q4 to Q3 this quarter? Or are you expecting some deceleration in transaction processing? Maybe you could kind of confirm the number for Q4 and then unpack it a little bit as to why it's below normal seasonality. Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Great. Toni, thanks very much for the question. I appreciate it. And I know Patricia really appreciates sticking to one question given it's her last call leading and piloting, and we thank her for all her efforts, but we'll have more time to celebrate in January. But as you stated, we remain confident in what our guidance is overall with regards to top-line revenue growth, 3% to 5%, albeit, as we said, low end. And that's just practically speaking given we have one more quarter to go. We said we expect similar performance, fourth quarter, as we just executed in third quarter, constant currency revenue growth, right? Let me unpack that to your point. First of all, at the macro level, historically, we would generate quarter-to-quarter about $2.9 billion-ish of revenue. Last year, by the way, we did $2.6 billion, up quarter-to-quarter in revenue. That $17.3 billion number in that ballpark, you're not too far off, is about equivalent to last year. It's about $2.6 billion. But I would tell you one thing underneath that, Toni, is we've seen a very different dramatic change in the currency FX U.S. dollar strengthening. To tune about $300 million, if you go look at the math, back into '19, 2020, 2021. So, underneath it, pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter performances last year, which by the way, I would highlight, was the peak of our ELA cycle last year and it was our strong first fourth quarter in a z16 environment. We're going to match that even taking into account the FX headwinds overall that we called out going forward. One last thing that I'll put and then I'll get into the color is, on a profit basis, although you didn't ask that, historically, profit, we generate somewhere, if I remember correctly studying over the weekend, about $1.3 billion quarter-to-quarter. You look at our operating pre-tax margin, which we recommitted 0.5 point for the year, that puts you in a profit range of, I don't know, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion quarter-to-quarter. So, you see the fundamental operating leverage of what's happening to our business. So, you put all that together, we still believe we have a very confident year at that 3% to 5%, by the way, led by Software, delivering 3 points of that IBM growth. Consistent, I would say, very good performance competitively in Consulting, driving about 2 points of IBM's growth. Infrastructure around the product cycle downside, we said beginning of the year and we're consistent, it's about 1 point hurt to IBM. And then, you got the divestiture impact of about 0.5 point. You put all that together, I think that's a pretty good year overall and pretty much on top of our model.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Sheila, let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Next we will hear from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nMatt Swanson: Yeah, thank you for taking my question. It was great to hear about some of the quantifiable success that you've seen in generative AI so far. But maybe flipping that a little bit, whether it's through early consulting engagements or customer conversations, where are you seeing some of the choke points that might hold up people from deploying as fast as they want? And whether it's through foundation models or some of your other tools around the governance side, kind of how that's developing your R&D to develop solutions for those problems?\nArvind Krishna: Yeah, thanks. Let me try to address your question here. Look, I think the concerns that people have are coming around, are these models accurate? How accurate are they? Do they result in things that may cause long-term liability? People are worried about the conversation because they hear and they read that whether it's artists, whether it's authors, whether it's code writers are suing some of the producers of large language models. You alluded to governance. That comes more around life cycle and how do you carry it out over the long term. Coupled with this are some people's concerns. If you add their own private data into a model, now what happens to the model? Where is it protected? Where does it stay? Do others learn from it? So, if you begin to unpack all of that, we begin to say, all right, for models that are IBM produced, we will give you indemnification, meaning, we are confident in our ability to stand by the data we have used to train, what is being used to be output, and we'll stand behind the same indemnification as we provide for all enterprise software. As you would expect, that's hard for us to do for open source models. But we believe that that takes care and that is why we are so excited about code and customer service to start with, because that's where we believe that people can benefit from this indemnification. Talking about the governance and the life cycle side, people are also worried about some of the long-term deployment, because an enterprise may well deploy a model for five or 10 years. So, the governance tools that allow you to keep a lineage of the data, used to train a model, and then, for those adding private data, we give them a commitment that data stays with them and the refinements of that model go nowhere else, helps to mitigate some of the fears and uncertainty around those issues. I do believe that this is going to play out well over the next few years, but I also want to point out there are many cases where people are not worried about some of these risks. If you're giving a quick website response, you could well use a model that may have some of these risks, because the danger in using any of those other areas is small. So that is how it's playing out right now. I expect to see a lot of deployment in 2024 going into full production across the world of whether you use the word large language models or foundation models or generative AI.\nPatricia Murphy: Great. Thank you, Matt. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. My question is on Consulting. I was very surprised to see 32% bookings growth after 24% the prior quarter, 7% the prior quarter. It's really diverging from your perceived rival in consulting [Accenture] (ph). And I was just wondering what the reasoning you would say is behind that. And then, Jim, with regard to those bookings, what does that do for your revenue visibility for Consulting, not only for the fourth quarter but for early next year? I would think the good book-to-bill might make you feel pretty confident about that 6% to 8% and continuing. Thanks a lot.\nJim Kavanaugh: Ben, thanks very much for the question. As I said earlier, pleased with the team overall in Consulting, not only on the signings and booking, but our revenue is well positioned for that 6% to 8%, which gave us confidence to reiterate that. But also the fundamentals of that business, right, we talked a lot about this over the last handful of years. We're getting good operating leverage in that business, good cash contribution. So, all in all, pretty pleased overall. When you look at the bookings overall, I mean, let's just put some statistics. Let me talk about kind of headwind, tailwind overall, because I think what you're trying to get at is the confidence level Arvind and I and the team have about this book of business going forward into fourth quarter and into '24. We're still seeing very good demand overall in areas around digital transformation, application modernization, and where there's real technology value, productivity, cost efficiency, quick payback. Is there pressure on discretionary-based activity and that like? Absolutely. But you know what, we've seen that all year long. We haven't seen really any substantive change in the macro and the client buying behaviors overall. But that has enabled us to grow 30%-plus. By the way, it's strongest bookings quarter we had quite a period of time and now we've got a trailing-12 month book-to-bill of 1.16 I think the strongest in about two-and-a-half years overall. Now, underneath that, what's going on? One, we've opened up IBM to strategic partnerships. We're seeing great ecosystem velocity and strategic partnership growth. Signings were about 50% year-over-year. Hyperscalers underneath that, 2x signings. Our hybrid cloud and application modernization, Red Hat, we signed north of $1 billion alone in the quarter. Now that's $10 billion inception to date. We got acquisitions that are now accretive and scaling nicely. So, I think from that aspect, you look at the top-end growth, we feel pretty confident about the 6% to 8% for this year, and we feel confident about the value and the growth contribution of the growth factor of consulting in our book of business heading into 2024. Now, with that said, headwinds wise, yeah, listen to every other services consulting company, there are macroeconomic challenges, without a doubt, uncertainty, but we got to go out and compete every single day here. And duration, I would say, not only we had great signings growth, we're monitoring our backlog realization. Our duration, by the way, this year has went up by a couple of months, but that revenue will play out over time. And all in all, if I sum it up, I think we're taking share. I'm pleased with the team.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Ben. Sheila, let's go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nErik Woodring: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. I'll stick to the one as well. Maybe Jim, this is for you. You didn't change your software consulting guidance ranges for the year. I think you had a minor benefit from Apptio closing early in 3Q, but you now expect a full year constant currency revenue growth to be at the low end of the 3% to 5% range. And so, I'm just wondering, should we now think about software consulting to grow at the lower ends of those ranges that you provided earlier, especially now kind of given some of your Red Hat comments? I'm just trying to understand what has changed underlying the different segments to get to kind of that new view on total revenue in constant currency? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes, thanks, Erik, I appreciate the question. So, similar to -- I think Toni asked something similar to this overall. When you look at IBM, 3% to 5%, just practically speaking, one quarter to go, we said, oh, it's better to say we're prudently at the low end of that range. Now, let's talk about it by segment. Software, you dial back 90 days ago. We said that we were very excited about the announced acquisition of Apptio. We said that we expected that to close in early fourth quarter. Team did an outstanding job. We got through that regulatory approval. We closed it mid-August. But when we announced that acquisition in July, we actually given our first half performance, both in our recurring revenue streams and the strength of that, but also in our transactional book of business. We actually took our full year guidance up to the high end of the range. Now we closed it -- and by the way, we said Apptio would be about 0.5 point on the full year. Now we closed it, what, a month, month-and-a-half earlier? Okay, so that 0.5 point of contribution on Apptio might be 70 basis points of contribution on a full year. We still feel very confident. By the way, through three quarters we're up 6.5%. That's above our mid-term model. Yes, we have the peak wrap on ELAs last year, but very interesting, underneath our third quarter year-to-year performance, we're growing transactional revenue. Very different profile than what we started out in January, which I think prudently we said we expected transactional revenue was going to be a headwind to us. What's happening? The new innovation we're bringing to market is actually creating much more volume of new ELA content that by the way is contributed about 1.5 point of growth above our expectation. And we're also getting great [closing in] (ph) NRR of 7 points versus history. So, we think like we just finished above our model in third quarter on constant currency on Software, we said in the prepared remarks, we expect a pretty similar fourth quarter at the high end overall, so we're maintaining Software. If you look at Consulting, we said 6% to 8% overall. By the way, year-to-date, we're up 6%. Actually, 6.4% to be exact. And we look at fourth quarter overall, we just talked about in Ben's question, our strong bookings, our book-to-bill at 1.16, the tailwinds on hybrid cloud around strategic partnerships, I think we feel pretty good about our overall guidance.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay. Very good. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. Jim, you provided some good detail on free cash flow year-to-date. And the question really is, are there any early indications on what non-operating items could impact free cash flow next year, working capital, cash taxes, et cetera, as well as how restructuring actions this year may flow into earnings and cash flow as well over the next several months?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yeah, David, thanks for the question overall. We'll spend a lot of time in January talking about 2024 free cash flow, but I'm glad you actually asked the question because we've been talking about free cash flow all year long. It's one of Arvind and IBM's two important metrics, revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We called out $10.5 billion, by the way, up $1.2 billion this year off of last year where we grew $2.8 billion year-to-year. And we said that's above our annualized model. Our annualized model is about [$750 million] (ph) per year coming on off the I&E and the business fundamentals. You look through the third quarter, we're up now $1 billion year-to-year. We're at $5.1 billion, very high quality by the way. Of that $1 billion, $700 million of it is cash sourced from operating profit overall, so that's the improving fundamentals of our sustainable revenue growth and our operating leverage and productivity we're driving in this business. And as I said all year long, I was very transparent in January, repeated it in April, said it again in July, and now let's say it again, when we look at that $1.2 billion free cash flow growth year-to-year, we're going to get most of it through cash source from profit, read that about $800 million to $900 million, and we said that we would get working capital efficiency this year. Why? Because of our 4Q '22 opportunity gap that we missed. And we called it out transparently in January. We're seeing that play out. You do the puts and takes. Yes, we're going to get a little bit of a modest tailwind on structural actions this year that will offset cash tax headwinds. But you look at the underlying $1.2 billion free cash flow growth, it is a high quality, fundamentally driven out of our revenue growth and operating leverage. Now, you look to '24, we'll spend a lot more time on cash tax, a lot of that is going to be predicated on where we actually finished fourth quarter overall. But we feel confident with the actions we've been putting in place, and we've got to earn the credibility and discipline here closing out a free cash flow quarter, by the way, that's $5.4 billion.\nPatricia Murphy: Very good. Sheila, let's take one last question.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Essex: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess maybe Arvind, if we could just circle back on this well-worked topic of AI, could you maybe just take a very high-level approach at how you're seeing customers evaluating adoption, and how that might impact the nature of contracts within the Consulting business and feed the watsonx platform? Maybe initial read on adoption rates in view into how Consulting could be the tip of the spear there? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: All right. Thanks, Brian, for the question. So, Consulting is going to be the tip of the spear, but it's not going to be the only, because some clients do have enough expertise inside to do things on their own. As we approach clients, trying to use, I'll call it, a big public chatbot to perhaps improve some service is not where they look to us, and we've been very clear that's not where we are going to go, and we do not actually serve up any of those services. However, I'll take maybe some quick examples as I go through. So, with a large, I'll use the word financial services company. They want to use generative AI to dramatically improve the productivity of their developers. They actually use their own proprietary languages, not only the common languages that are available outside. They are then asking the question, who can I trust to augment their model, give it to me, and I don't really want to get into all the details of how I might use it, but I want them to provide the technology. In this case, Brian, we would work with them to augment the model using their language and their data and their code snippets. We would do it in a way that they are completely comfortable, meaning 100% that that leaks nowhere else. They would take back the model. It now becomes an as-a-service deployment in their private cloud infrastructure, and we monetize it as is typical for as-a-service software. I'll take another example that we are building out with Dun & Bradstreet, and I mentioned that briefly on the call. In that case, it is consulting led. They want to work with consulting to use watsonx in this case, but to help them create solutions that let their clients get greater insight, aka helps D&B monetize their data better. So, in that case, it is absolutely consulting led. I think without consulting, we would not have landed that deal. Let me go to others, because there are also examples where our Consulting team is using both what's available with Azure OpenAI, as an example, to go win deals because they have built up their expertise. They've also built up expertise on Amazon's Braket platform, and they're going forward with winning deals on those. In that case, they're coming in with the methodology, with knowledge, with the thousands of trained consultants who know how to work on those platforms, and they are working with the clients to go do that. I think these are all examples of what is working. I think you are trying to also ask is it going to be Consulting or is it going to be Software? Look, we didn't say much on the call on this topic. We just characterized it as low hundreds of millions of dollars of booking. But in the absence of anything else, think of that as maybe half and half between Consulting and Software, which does tell you that a couple of points of growth for both those units came from the generative AI that we've been putting out. And I think that's the best way to think about it in terms of what's happening right now. And we are certainly expecting and planning that that will only increase as the quarters go on. All right. So, let me now wrap up the call. This third quarter performance reinforced our confidence in the strategy and in our ability to deliver value to enterprise clients in today's environment. We're excited of the opportunities ahead of us, and I look forward to taking through -- you through our continued progress and our view of 2024 in January. Thank you all.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay, Sheila, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. I'll get right into the financial highlights of the quarter. We delivered $14.8 billion of revenue, $2.3 billion of operating pre-tax income, and $2.20 of operating earnings per share. Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated $5.1 billion of free cash flow. Reported revenue growth was 4.6%. This includes just over 1 point of growth from currency translation, which is significantly less than the currency rates suggested in July. In fact, currency movements over the last 90 days impacted our third quarter revenue by about $250 million. At constant currency, our revenue was up 3.5%. As is typical, I'll focus the discussion on constant currency. Arvind talked about clients' priorities in today's environment, which are driving solid growth in our Software and Consulting offerings. I'll remind you, Software and Consulting are our two growth vectors, and together make up about three quarters of our revenue base. Software revenue was up 6%, as clients leverage their data for insights and automate their IT in a hybrid environment. We had good growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing revenue. Our Consulting business had another solid quarter with 5% revenue growth, strong signings performance, and a book-to-bill ratio greater than 1.15 over the last year. We are capitalizing on our continued momentum in the market, as we help clients get value from hybrid cloud and AI and leverage our strategic partnerships. Our Infrastructure revenue was down 3%, with growth in zSystems. More and more we are seeing clients embrace IBM Z in their hybrid cloud environments, especially in regulated industries. This growth was offset by declines in Distributed Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. IBM's revenue growth, together with a good portfolio mix and yield from our productivity initiatives, generated strong margin, profit and free cash flow performance. Operating gross margin expanded 160 basis points, and operating pre-tax margin expanded 170 basis points. Within that PTI margin, we absorbed a year-to-year currency impact of over 150 basis points. Despite that headwind, our margin expansion was broad based, with improvements in every business segment. Driving efficiency and productivity has always been part of our operating and financial models. These ongoing productivity initiatives enable reinvestment in the business, increase financial flexibility and contribute to margin expansion. Our activities range from simplifying our application environment to digitally transforming our business processes by applying AI at scale. We are ahead of pace to achieve our target of $2 billion in annual run-rate savings by the end of 2024. While there is still more to do, I am pleased with our progress. The combination of our revenue and margin performance yielded strong profit growth. Operating pre-tax profit was up 17% to $2.3 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, and over $5 billion year-to-date, which is up $1 billion versus last year. Free cash flow growth through the first three quarters was driven primarily by cash sourced from our operating profit performance. We also had working capital efficiencies driven by solid collections. These growth drivers were partially offset by higher performance-based compensation payments earlier in the year. In terms of cash uses, year-to-date we spent about $5 billion on acquisitions and returned $4.5 billion to shareholders through dividends. Our resulting cash balance at the end of September was $11 billion. That's up over $2 billion from year-end, but with the acquisition of Apptio in the third quarter, cash is down over $5 billion from June. Our debt balance is now $55 billion, also down from June. Putting this all together, our business fundamentals are solid, with sustainable revenue growth, margin expansion, solid cash generation and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business into the future. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6%, with contribution from Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. This performance reflects growth in both our transactional revenue and our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of our annual Software revenue. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 7% with growth across Red Hat, Automation and Data & AI, as we execute our platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Red Hat revenue was up 8%. We continue to deliver good growth in OpenShift and Ansible, both gaining share again this quarter. Clients are committing to our hybrid cloud approach with annual bookings up 14% in the quarter. This includes double-digit growth across RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible, partially offset by headwinds in consumption-based services. IT and business automation are top client priorities, and we've been investing to capture the opportunity. This quarter, our Automation revenue grew 13%, with pervasive growth across all business areas. We had strength in AIOps and Management driven by good performance in Instana, Turbonomic and now Apptio as clients look to optimize business outcomes and boost productivity. Data & AI revenue was up 6%. Growth areas include Data Fabric and Customer Care as enterprise clients are both preparing for and adopting generative AI solutions, leveraging watsonx. We also grew in Asset & Supply Chain Management as we help enterprises run sustainable operations. Security revenue declined 3%. We delivered growth in security software driven by Data Security and Identity & Access Management. This was more than offset by declines in managed security services. Looking across these businesses, our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR has grown to $14 billion, up 7% since last year. In Transaction Processing, revenue was up 5%. Throughout this year, we've been talking about how the success of the last couple of zSystems cycles is driving demand for this mission-critical software. This, together with price increases, contributed to year-to-date growth in both recurring and transactional software revenue in Transaction Processing. Moving to profit for the Software segment, we expanded gross and pre-tax margins. Our pre-tax margin was up 120 basis points, even while absorbing over 2 points of impact from currency. We continued to deliver operating leverage, driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter. Our Consulting revenue was up 5% with growth across all three lines of business and geographies. With another quarter of strong signings, as I said, our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio is now over 1.15. Clients continue to prioritize transformation projects that enable cost savings and productivity. These results are a proof point that we are well positioned to meet these needs in today's complex environment. IBM's focused hybrid cloud and AI strategy has become even more of a differentiator as clients' interest in generative AI continues to ramp. We are helping clients understand how AI can be used to automate tasks, make better decisions with speed and improve customer experiences. We've made a series of AI announcements over the last few months demonstrating continued advancement of our strategic partnerships. We are providing clients with the opportunity to accelerate their transformation and deploy generative AI responsibly, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners, or a combination. Today, our strategic partnerships account for about 40% of Consulting revenue and have continued to grow double digits across revenue and signings. In aggregate, our hyperscaler partnership revenue was up over 40%, and signings essentially doubled year-to-year. Additionally, our Red Hat practice, which helps clients optimize how they build, deploy and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment has continued to grow at a double-digit rate, with over $1 billion of signings in the quarter. All of what I've just mentioned, from market demand, to how we're positioned and partnering, to our investments to drive growth, is reflected in our overall Consulting revenue performance. You can see that play out across our three lines of business. In Business Transformation, revenue grew 5%, again led by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Finance and supply chain transformations also contributed to the growth. In Technology Consulting, revenue was up 1%. Growth in cloud-based application development and modernization work was partially offset by declines in on-prem application-focused projects. In Application Operations, revenue grew 7%, driven by both cloud application management and platform engineering services. In platform engineering, we help clients design an application environment that runs securely and smoothly at scale. Moving to Consulting profit, we expanded gross margin 150 basis points. Pre-tax margin expanded 40 basis points to just over 10%. Our year-to-year margin performance reflects productivity actions we've taken, mitigated by increased labor costs and about 1 point of pre-tax margin impact from currency. Moving to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was down 3%. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue was flat, while Infrastructure Support declined 7%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, zSystems grew 9% in a seasonally smaller revenue quarter. z16 revenue remains well ahead of prior cycles after six quarters of availability. The program strength reflects both growing enterprise workload requirements and the economic value at scale of the platform in traditional processing and Linux consolidation. In fact, installed MIPs capacity for Linux on Z has grown more than four-fold over the last decade. Clients continue to value the security, resiliency and hybrid cloud capabilities of the zSystems platform. Distributed Infrastructure revenue was down 6% as compared to a strong growth in last year of 21% as we introduced innovation across Storage and Power10. This quarter, we had growth in Power offset by declines in Storage. In the Infrastructure segment, we had strong gross and pre-tax margin performance. Pre-tax margin expanded 350 basis points, reflecting benefits from portfolio mix with our zSystems performance and productivity, while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to talk about our expectations before we go to Q&A. Just about two years ago, we introduced Today's IBM, a more focused business with a platform-based approach to hybrid cloud and AI. Since then, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and our talent base, and drive productivity across our business. The result is a business that addresses today's client needs, with a stronger financial profile. Our third quarter performance reinforces this progress with 3.5% revenue growth, gross and pre-tax margin expansion and strong free cash flow generation. Now, with three quarters of the year behind us, we are holding our full year view of our two primary financial metrics, revenue growth and free cash flow. We continue to expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%, and free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, that's up $1.2 billion over last year. We've had solid revenue performance all year in our growth vectors of Software and Consulting. We still expect Software revenue growth at the high end of its mid-single digit model, and Consulting revenue in the 6% to 8% range. Infrastructure revenue, of course, reflects product cycle dynamics. In total, with one quarter to go, it's prudent to assume the low end of IBM's 3% to 5% range. We are making great progress in our productivity initiatives. The work we are doing to digitally transform our business not only makes us more nimble by simplifying and streamlining our processes and operations, but it also frees up spend for reinvestment, provides financial flexibility and delivers operating leverage. This contributes to solid margin and free cash flow performance. We continue to expect about a 0.5 point of operating pre-tax margin improvement, and we see a mid-teens tax rate for the year. Our free cash flow performance has been driven primarily from our profit performance. Through the first three quarters, we're up $1 billion year-to-year, and we've delivered nearly 50% of our full year expectation, which is ahead of our historical attainment. While, as always, we are reliant on a seasonally strong fourth quarter, we're on track to achieve about $10.5 billion for the year. As I look specifically at the fourth quarter, with the recent currency movements, we now see currency to be neutral to a 1-point headwind to revenue growth. That's nearly $600 million worse than 90 days ago. I'd expect constant currency revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to the third. That's despite a tough compare from last year's strong ELA contribution in Software and the large z16 transactional performance in Infrastructure. This demonstrates continued momentum in our underlying business. Bring it all together, we've clearly got a higher-growth, higher-value business with strong cash generation, a business well-positioned for the future. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Patricia, let's get started. Yeah, thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question. Obviously, we're very pleased overall with our Software segment performance growing 8%, actual 6% at constant currency, really led pretty pervasively with growth across the board. Automation led Red Hat at 8%, as you said, and I'll come to that in a second, but data and AI overall. Really underpinning all that is like we said, starting the year: one, a very strong solid recurring revenue base, high value, 80% of that portfolio, by the way, growing mid-single-digit growth, you see that play out in our transaction processing that we call the growth factor; and then also our hybrid platform and solution business, $14 billion ARR that's growing high-single-digit overall. Now within that, you see Red Hat. Red Hat we talked about in the prepared remarks. First of all, Arvind and I would acknowledge, we came in a couple of points below our expectation. And I think that's an execution discussion overall. Embedded in that, where did it come from? It came from -- because I think this is very important, it came from the consumption-based services and offering side of the equation, which by the way is about 20% of our portfolio, shorter duration overall, and it went from last quarter high single digit, which is about what the model is, to low single digit overall. If you look at that and compare that now, let's look at the other part of the portfolio, the remaining 80%. That is our subscription-based business. That's our RHEL franchise, industry market leader, that's Red Hat OpenShift, and that's Ansible. We had a very strong annualized bookings in the quarter, which again, subscription-based business model, we talked about all year long, we were going to be back-end loaded on renewals. We grew that mid-teens overall, including services by the way. If I extract out that 20% portfolio services and just look at the core subscription-based businesses of Red Hat, OpenShift and Ansible, we grew 19% overall. 110%-plus NRR on that renewal rate of that business. And within that 19%, OpenShift and Ansible were north of 40% with RHEL growing double digits. So, putting all that together, I think it's prudent right now when we look at fourth quarter, we're only building into our model -- again, Software at the high end of our segment model, we're only building in high single digit. We have to continue to monitor what happened to us in the third quarter, get the team focused on execution. But I would tell you, just given the signings growth that we posted in the third quarter, and by the way, another good pipeline in the fourth quarter, we feel very confident in the long-term posture of Red Hat growing double digits. We just got to get through and monitor what's happening to us on the services side. So, thanks very much for the question. Great. Toni, thanks very much for the question. I appreciate it. And I know Patricia really appreciates sticking to one question given it's her last call leading and piloting, and we thank her for all her efforts, but we'll have more time to celebrate in January. But as you stated, we remain confident in what our guidance is overall with regards to top-line revenue growth, 3% to 5%, albeit, as we said, low end. And that's just practically speaking given we have one more quarter to go. We said we expect similar performance, fourth quarter, as we just executed in third quarter, constant currency revenue growth, right? Let me unpack that to your point. First of all, at the macro level, historically, we would generate quarter-to-quarter about $2.9 billion-ish of revenue. Last year, by the way, we did $2.6 billion, up quarter-to-quarter in revenue. That $17.3 billion number in that ballpark, you're not too far off, is about equivalent to last year. It's about $2.6 billion. But I would tell you one thing underneath that, Toni, is we've seen a very different dramatic change in the currency FX U.S. dollar strengthening. To tune about $300 million, if you go look at the math, back into '19, 2020, 2021. So, underneath it, pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter performances last year, which by the way, I would highlight, was the peak of our ELA cycle last year and it was our strong first fourth quarter in a z16 environment. We're going to match that even taking into account the FX headwinds overall that we called out going forward. One last thing that I'll put and then I'll get into the color is, on a profit basis, although you didn't ask that, historically, profit, we generate somewhere, if I remember correctly studying over the weekend, about $1.3 billion quarter-to-quarter. You look at our operating pre-tax margin, which we recommitted 0.5 point for the year, that puts you in a profit range of, I don't know, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion quarter-to-quarter. So, you see the fundamental operating leverage of what's happening to our business. So, you put all that together, we still believe we have a very confident year at that 3% to 5%, by the way, led by Software, delivering 3 points of that IBM growth. Consistent, I would say, very good performance competitively in Consulting, driving about 2 points of IBM's growth. Infrastructure around the product cycle downside, we said beginning of the year and we're consistent, it's about 1 point hurt to IBM. And then, you got the divestiture impact of about 0.5 point. You put all that together, I think that's a pretty good year overall and pretty much on top of our model. Ben, thanks very much for the question. As I said earlier, pleased with the team overall in Consulting, not only on the signings and booking, but our revenue is well positioned for that 6% to 8%, which gave us confidence to reiterate that. But also the fundamentals of that business, right, we talked a lot about this over the last handful of years. We're getting good operating leverage in that business, good cash contribution. So, all in all, pretty pleased overall. When you look at the bookings overall, I mean, let's just put some statistics. Let me talk about kind of headwind, tailwind overall, because I think what you're trying to get at is the confidence level Arvind and I and the team have about this book of business going forward into fourth quarter and into '24. We're still seeing very good demand overall in areas around digital transformation, application modernization, and where there's real technology value, productivity, cost efficiency, quick payback. Is there pressure on discretionary-based activity and that like? Absolutely. But you know what, we've seen that all year long. We haven't seen really any substantive change in the macro and the client buying behaviors overall. But that has enabled us to grow 30%-plus. By the way, it's strongest bookings quarter we had quite a period of time and now we've got a trailing-12 month book-to-bill of 1.16 I think the strongest in about two-and-a-half years overall. Now, underneath that, what's going on? One, we've opened up IBM to strategic partnerships. We're seeing great ecosystem velocity and strategic partnership growth. Signings were about 50% year-over-year. Hyperscalers underneath that, 2x signings. Our hybrid cloud and application modernization, Red Hat, we signed north of $1 billion alone in the quarter. Now that's $10 billion inception to date. We got acquisitions that are now accretive and scaling nicely. So, I think from that aspect, you look at the top-end growth, we feel pretty confident about the 6% to 8% for this year, and we feel confident about the value and the growth contribution of the growth factor of consulting in our book of business heading into 2024. Now, with that said, headwinds wise, yeah, listen to every other services consulting company, there are macroeconomic challenges, without a doubt, uncertainty, but we got to go out and compete every single day here. And duration, I would say, not only we had great signings growth, we're monitoring our backlog realization. Our duration, by the way, this year has went up by a couple of months, but that revenue will play out over time. And all in all, if I sum it up, I think we're taking share. I'm pleased with the team. Yes, thanks, Erik, I appreciate the question. So, similar to -- I think Toni asked something similar to this overall. When you look at IBM, 3% to 5%, just practically speaking, one quarter to go, we said, oh, it's better to say we're prudently at the low end of that range. Now, let's talk about it by segment. Software, you dial back 90 days ago. We said that we were very excited about the announced acquisition of Apptio. We said that we expected that to close in early fourth quarter. Team did an outstanding job. We got through that regulatory approval. We closed it mid-August. But when we announced that acquisition in July, we actually given our first half performance, both in our recurring revenue streams and the strength of that, but also in our transactional book of business. We actually took our full year guidance up to the high end of the range. Now we closed it -- and by the way, we said Apptio would be about 0.5 point on the full year. Now we closed it, what, a month, month-and-a-half earlier? Okay, so that 0.5 point of contribution on Apptio might be 70 basis points of contribution on a full year. We still feel very confident. By the way, through three quarters we're up 6.5%. That's above our mid-term model. Yes, we have the peak wrap on ELAs last year, but very interesting, underneath our third quarter year-to-year performance, we're growing transactional revenue. Very different profile than what we started out in January, which I think prudently we said we expected transactional revenue was going to be a headwind to us. What's happening? The new innovation we're bringing to market is actually creating much more volume of new ELA content that by the way is contributed about 1.5 point of growth above our expectation. And we're also getting great [closing in] (ph) NRR of 7 points versus history. So, we think like we just finished above our model in third quarter on constant currency on Software, we said in the prepared remarks, we expect a pretty similar fourth quarter at the high end overall, so we're maintaining Software. If you look at Consulting, we said 6% to 8% overall. By the way, year-to-date, we're up 6%. Actually, 6.4% to be exact. And we look at fourth quarter overall, we just talked about in Ben's question, our strong bookings, our book-to-bill at 1.16, the tailwinds on hybrid cloud around strategic partnerships, I think we feel pretty good about our overall guidance. Yeah, David, thanks for the question overall. We'll spend a lot of time in January talking about 2024 free cash flow, but I'm glad you actually asked the question because we've been talking about free cash flow all year long. It's one of Arvind and IBM's two important metrics, revenue growth, free cash flow generation. We called out $10.5 billion, by the way, up $1.2 billion this year off of last year where we grew $2.8 billion year-to-year. And we said that's above our annualized model. Our annualized model is about [$750 million] (ph) per year coming on off the I&E and the business fundamentals. You look through the third quarter, we're up now $1 billion year-to-year. We're at $5.1 billion, very high quality by the way. Of that $1 billion, $700 million of it is cash sourced from operating profit overall, so that's the improving fundamentals of our sustainable revenue growth and our operating leverage and productivity we're driving in this business. And as I said all year long, I was very transparent in January, repeated it in April, said it again in July, and now let's say it again, when we look at that $1.2 billion free cash flow growth year-to-year, we're going to get most of it through cash source from profit, read that about $800 million to $900 million, and we said that we would get working capital efficiency this year. Why? Because of our 4Q '22 opportunity gap that we missed. And we called it out transparently in January. We're seeing that play out. You do the puts and takes. Yes, we're going to get a little bit of a modest tailwind on structural actions this year that will offset cash tax headwinds. But you look at the underlying $1.2 billion free cash flow growth, it is a high quality, fundamentally driven out of our revenue growth and operating leverage. Now, you look to '24, we'll spend a lot more time on cash tax, a lot of that is going to be predicated on where we actually finished fourth quarter overall. But we feel confident with the actions we've been putting in place, and we've got to earn the credibility and discipline here closing out a free cash flow quarter, by the way, that's $5.4 billion."

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us. Before we start, let me address the outbreak of war in Israel. We condemn all acts of terrorism. We are also saddened over the loss of innocent lives and join the global community in the hope that peace and safety can be restored. Let me now turn to our business performance. In the third quarter, we had solid growth across revenue, profit and free cash flow while delivering innovations and positioning our business to capture future opportunities. On the broader trends we are seeing in the market, technology continues to serve as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Businesses and governments around the world are looking for opportunities to address demographic shifts, make their supply chains more resilient and improve sustainability. More recently, geopolitical events and the reality of higher for longer, add to the growing uncertainty. Technology helps organizations better deal with the many challenges they face. We see both tailwinds and headwinds to overall spending. Nearly every business we talk to wants to leverage technology to offer better services, scale more quickly, and fuel growth without increasing their footprint. This has been driving demand for technologies that boost productivity and competitiveness, like hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. Overall, we believe the tailwinds outweigh the headwinds, and technology spend will continue to outpace GDP. In this past quarter, we saw good revenue growth in Software and Consulting. In Infrastructure, more than a year into the product cycle, we continue to see good adoption of z16. Our overall growth reflects our ability to help clients to leverage data and AI for competitive advantage, automate IT environments, and seamlessly integrate hybrid cloud solutions. We also continue to position our business for the future: launching new products and offerings, forging and expanding key partnerships, investing in talent and skills, and focusing our portfolio. We have been taking concrete actions to deliver productivity in our own business. All of this results in an IBM that is aligned to our clients' most pressing needs and has a stronger financial profile. Our third quarter results are another proof point. Typically, at this point, I'd talk about hybrid cloud and the progress we have made. Hybrid cloud remains vitally important to our clients and to our business. Given the inflection in AI and more specifically generative AI, I want to spend more time today on AI and how we're approaching this opportunity. We believe that generative AI will be multi-model, with clients using a combination of IBM's models, other company's models, their own proprietary models and open-source models. This hybrid approach to AI is similar to the hybrid approach to cloud. Let me give you an overview of the capabilities we have been building. Our generative AI software stack starts with Red Hat OpenShift, which serves as the foundation that allows clients to operate in a hybrid environment. Data services help make their data ready for AI. watsonx is the core platform that enables clients to train, tune, validate and deploy AI models. We are providing models that address specific domains such as code, language, and cybersecurity, among others. Our AI assistants include the watsonx Code Assistant to augment developers, watsonx Assistant to augment customer service agents and watsonx Orchestrate to augment employees. This quarter, we introduced new AI capabilities for our clients and partners. We unveiled Granite, a multi-billion parameter foundation model on watsonx.ai, which excels in both language and code. We also introduced the watsonx Code Assistant. This includes the watsonx Code Assistant for Z, to help clients accelerate the modernization of mainframe code and apps. It's fueled by a 20-billion parameter model and can, as an example, swiftly translate COBOL to Java. There are hundreds of billions of lines of code written in COBOL, so the opportunity is significant. Looking forward, we plan to launch watsonx.governance before the end of the year, that provides governance tools businesses need to mitigate risks and ensure compliance through the AI lifecycle. This is a key consideration for clients as they go beyond early proof of concepts into real deployments. To bring our AI capabilities to life, we have more than 20,000 data and AI consultants, including a center of excellence for generative AI. Our teams help clients navigate the AI landscape, from crafting a strategy, understanding how AI can be used and deploying AI responsibly. These consultants also provide valuable real-time feedback to our product teams. As in hybrid cloud, our ecosystem across GSIs, ISVs and hyperscalers plays a critical role in bringing generative AI to our clients. In the work we are doing, clear patterns are emerging in terms of the AI enterprise use cases. Based on extensive feedback and trials to date, three have risen to the top. Code modernization, customer service and digital labor all have broad relevance and deliver tangible business benefits. We have also seen this internally, as we apply our AI capabilities to areas such as client support, HR, IT optimization and source-to-pay, to automate a significant portion of tasks and improve the productivity of our people. Our book of business in the third quarter specifically related to generative AI was in the low hundreds of millions of dollars. The interest is larger, with thousands of hands-on interactions with our clients. These are across our largest clients and smaller clients, which lays the groundwork for future watsonx opportunities. Let me close the discussion on AI by talking about a couple of client examples. Dun & Bradstreet is leveraging our consulting and software capabilities, fueled by watsonx, to help their clients create proprietary generative AI solutions. IBM and EY also just announced a new solution powered by watsonx Orchestrate, to enhance EY's People Advisory services. We continue to bring innovations to the market in areas other than AI. This includes new innovations to our industry-leading hybrid cloud platform, Red Hat OpenShift, which was recognized recently by both Gartner and Forrester as a leader in container management. We completed the acquisition of Apptio, which complements our IT automation capabilities. In quantum, we are making good progress in building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance and materials. In closing, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We launched our generative AI platform and have good momentum in helping our clients use this important technology. We continue to take portfolio actions to increase our focus on hybrid cloud and AI. And we are applying AI within our own business, improving execution speed and unlocking real value. All of this reinforces my confidence in our future. We're executing a strategy that closely resonates with our clients' needs, and this is propelling our business forward. Three quarters into the year, we are well positioned to deliver on 2023 expectations for both revenue growth and free cash flow. Now, to offer you a more detailed view of our results and the rest of 2023, I'll hand it over to Jim. Hi, Amit. So, thanks for the question. And it's actually wonderful to talk about this. So, generative AI, just for me to very quickly reiterate the use cases, we found that our clients were really climbing on to on code, on customer service, and on, I'll call it, general digital workers, which is productivity in every enterprise function. So, if you look at code, to a person, every one of the clients said, we don't intend to get rid of any developers, but this allows us to take care of the tech debt that we've accumulated and makes every developer more productive. Amit, I'll kind of point out, most enterprises are very quick to realize, if you are more productive, that means you have a competitive advantage to your peers. And if they have a competitive advantage to their peers, they'll take share without spending more on labor. That's an incredible long-term competitive advantage. When you go to customer service, there is a cost takeout aspect, but it's not 100%. But there is probably a 20% to 30%. If you can have more calls, more chats answered by AI, that means you can have much more volume with a smaller number of people. So, there is both. Also, I'll point out to our audience, AI does not get tired. It doesn't get angry. It doesn't get upset. So, there is a NPS improvement you get along with it. And then on the third one, on digital workers, there likely is a small productivity improvement, but I would call it more in the 4%, 5%, 10%, not 20% 30%, 40%. So, in the macro headwinds you're mentioning, higher interest rates, tougher to get skilled people, all of the issues around the geopolitical uncertainty that causes some of the concern might have caused a pause in some other environments. The AI side, and to be candid, the hybrid cloud side, offers them a way through that without having to decrease their ambitions for next year. And I think we're seeing every one of them play to that. And I think that these are more fundamentals, these are more core processes than some of the other areas that people were worrying about two or three years ago. When two or three years ago, people were worrying a lot about, what do I do to keep all our employees happy? And can I add up all the tools for that? I think there's much less of a focus on that area. Yeah, thanks. Let me try to address your question here. Look, I think the concerns that people have are coming around, are these models accurate? How accurate are they? Do they result in things that may cause long-term liability? People are worried about the conversation because they hear and they read that whether it's artists, whether it's authors, whether it's code writers are suing some of the producers of large language models. You alluded to governance. That comes more around life cycle and how do you carry it out over the long term. Coupled with this are some people's concerns. If you add their own private data into a model, now what happens to the model? Where is it protected? Where does it stay? Do others learn from it? So, if you begin to unpack all of that, we begin to say, all right, for models that are IBM produced, we will give you indemnification, meaning, we are confident in our ability to stand by the data we have used to train, what is being used to be output, and we'll stand behind the same indemnification as we provide for all enterprise software. As you would expect, that's hard for us to do for open source models. But we believe that that takes care and that is why we are so excited about code and customer service to start with, because that's where we believe that people can benefit from this indemnification. Talking about the governance and the life cycle side, people are also worried about some of the long-term deployment, because an enterprise may well deploy a model for five or 10 years. So, the governance tools that allow you to keep a lineage of the data, used to train a model, and then, for those adding private data, we give them a commitment that data stays with them and the refinements of that model go nowhere else, helps to mitigate some of the fears and uncertainty around those issues. I do believe that this is going to play out well over the next few years, but I also want to point out there are many cases where people are not worried about some of these risks. If you're giving a quick website response, you could well use a model that may have some of these risks, because the danger in using any of those other areas is small. So that is how it's playing out right now. I expect to see a lot of deployment in 2024 going into full production across the world of whether you use the word large language models or foundation models or generative AI. All right. Thanks, Brian, for the question. So, Consulting is going to be the tip of the spear, but it's not going to be the only, because some clients do have enough expertise inside to do things on their own. As we approach clients, trying to use, I'll call it, a big public chatbot to perhaps improve some service is not where they look to us, and we've been very clear that's not where we are going to go, and we do not actually serve up any of those services. However, I'll take maybe some quick examples as I go through. So, with a large, I'll use the word financial services company. They want to use generative AI to dramatically improve the productivity of their developers. They actually use their own proprietary languages, not only the common languages that are available outside. They are then asking the question, who can I trust to augment their model, give it to me, and I don't really want to get into all the details of how I might use it, but I want them to provide the technology. In this case, Brian, we would work with them to augment the model using their language and their data and their code snippets. We would do it in a way that they are completely comfortable, meaning 100% that that leaks nowhere else. They would take back the model. It now becomes an as-a-service deployment in their private cloud infrastructure, and we monetize it as is typical for as-a-service software. I'll take another example that we are building out with Dun & Bradstreet, and I mentioned that briefly on the call. In that case, it is consulting led. They want to work with consulting to use watsonx in this case, but to help them create solutions that let their clients get greater insight, aka helps D&B monetize their data better. So, in that case, it is absolutely consulting led. I think without consulting, we would not have landed that deal. Let me go to others, because there are also examples where our Consulting team is using both what's available with Azure OpenAI, as an example, to go win deals because they have built up their expertise. They've also built up expertise on Amazon's Braket platform, and they're going forward with winning deals on those. In that case, they're coming in with the methodology, with knowledge, with the thousands of trained consultants who know how to work on those platforms, and they are working with the clients to go do that. I think these are all examples of what is working. I think you are trying to also ask is it going to be Consulting or is it going to be Software? Look, we didn't say much on the call on this topic. We just characterized it as low hundreds of millions of dollars of booking. But in the absence of anything else, think of that as maybe half and half between Consulting and Software, which does tell you that a couple of points of growth for both those units came from the generative AI that we've been putting out. And I think that's the best way to think about it in terms of what's happening right now. And we are certainly expecting and planning that that will only increase as the quarters go on. All right. So, let me now wrap up the call. This third quarter performance reinforced our confidence in the strategy and in our ability to deliver value to enterprise clients in today's environment. We're excited of the opportunities ahead of us, and I look forward to taking through -- you through our continued progress and our view of 2024 in January. Thank you all."

We again had strength in our growth vectors of software and consulting and solid cash generation, consistent with our financial model. Clients and partners continue to view technology as a source of competitive advantage. Clients turn to us to speed up their transformation journeys, modernize applications and optimize their business workflows. At the same time, they continue to prioritize projects that focus on productivity and deliver quick time to value. To seize this opportunity, we are bringing new innovations to market, expanding strategic partnerships, and making investments in targeted growth markets, while unlocking value through our productivity initiatives. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year expectations for revenue and free cash flow, which remain our two primary areas of focus. We've made progress in our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI, the two key drivers of business innovation. Hybrid cloud is the most widespread form of IT architecture. Red Hat OpenShift, our leading container platform based on open-source innovations plays a crucial role in making this possible along with IBM software and infrastructure. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed-up clients' digital transformation journeys and help drive adoption of our technology platforms. Our broad ecosystem of partners amplifies our reach and ability to meet client demand. Let me highlight a few collaborations from this past quarter that take advantage of our platform-centric approach. We're helping Air Canada, improve its digital footprint, including their website, mobile application, and loyalty program. Using a hybrid cloud approach helps Air Canada better connect and tap into their commercial, operational, and financial data. With Diageo, IBM Consulting embarked on a large global digital transformation to improve customer satisfaction, optimize business workflows, and enhance its financial performance reporting capabilities. We also forged a strategic partnership with Nokia, where Red Hat OpenShift becomes the preferred platform provider to Nokia's core network applications business. This past quarter, we made strategic moves to bolster our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities with the announcement of our plans to acquire Apptio, which offer the virtual command center for CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs to manage their technology investments. Apptio\u2019s offerings combined with IBM's IT automation software and our AI capabilities, will give clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize their IT environments. AI is a transformative technology that has the potential to unlock tremendous business value. According to a recent McKinsey study, AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Our focus is on enterprise AI, designed to address these opportunities and solve business problems. The list of use cases is long and includes IT operations, code generation, improved automation, customer service, augmenting HR, predictive maintenance, financial forecasting, fraud detection, compliance monitoring, security, sales, risk management, and supply chain amongst others. AI is being infused into our software products. We are already building products that address specific enterprise use cases such as digital labor with Watson Orchestrate, customer service with Watson Assistant, and co-generation with Watson Code Assistant. And our Think Conference in May, we announced what's the next, our enterprise-ready AI and data platform to help clients and partners, capitalize on the AI opportunity. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. We began to rollout watsonx, a little over a week ago and we are excited by the client response. To-date, the platform has been shaped by more than 150 businesses across industries from telco to banking. Businesses around the world are excited about tapping foundation models and machine learning in one place, with their own data to accelerate generative AI workloads. For example, Samsung is exploring generative AI to deliver unprecedented innovation for clients. Citi is pursuing the potential use of large language models for connecting controls to internal processes. NatWest is embedding watsonx into its chatbot to improve customer experience and SAP is integrating IBM Watson AI into their solutions. IBM is also working with an expanding ecosystem of partners to co-create and innovate across industries and use cases from space to sports, including work with NASA to build the first foundation models for analyzing geospatial data and Wimbledon, where watsonx was used to produce tennis commentary. Large language models are a step-change in the evolution of AI, with more than 80% of enterprises exploring their use. We believe the opportunity for large language models for enterprises is immense. Given the existing amount of business data, this includes sensor data, chemistry data, material data, geospatial data, code, and of course, speech. Because enterprise AI draws from both public and private data, it is more effectively trained and companies adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Enterprise AI can also be based on multiple models, including public, private, and open-source. Our watsonx platform takes into account this reality and is differentiated in a few important ways. For instance, instead of relying on a single model watsonx enables companies to leverage the best models to meet their needs, whether they are open-source technologies, IBM's models, or those co-created with us. Another fundamental aspect of watsonx is trust, ensuring transparency and bias free models. In addition, beyond offering companies the capability to tap into existing AI models, IBM empowers them to create their own. To help clients on this journey, we have over 20,000 data and AI consultants and recently launched our new Center of Excellence for generative AI, already staffed with more than a 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise. The investments we're making in products and skills will help us to seize the AI opportunity. Our path is clear, in the same way we have built a consulting practice around Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform, that is now measured in the billions of dollars, we will do the same with AI. And just like OpenShift is the technology platform at the heart of our hybrid cloud capabilities, watsonx will be the core technology platform for our AI capabilities. Watsonx is just one of many new technology innovations. Shortly after previewing watsonx at our Think Conference at the Red Hat Summit, we introduced OpenShift AI, which is a unified solution to train, serve, monitor, and manage the lifecycle of AI models and applications. We also unveiled IBM hybrid cloud mesh, a SaaS solution that streamlines application-centric connectivity for edge, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. To help clients with their sustainability agendas, we launched our AI-powered cloud-based tool that helps clients track their greenhouse gas emissions for cloud workloads. And as an example of how we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, IBM recently demonstrated using error mitigating techniques, quantum computers can produce results at a scale of 100-plus cubits. This is a significant breakthrough that firmly puts us on a path towards building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance, and materials. Let me conclude by reiterating our confidence in our strategy and execution. It is clear that the work we have done to better align IBM to the needs of our clients is paying off. The momentum in our business and continued focus on productivity, position us to achieve our full-year expectations and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. With that, I would like to hand it over to Jim who will delve deeper into our performance and expectations.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the key financial highlights of the second quarter. We delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.4 billion of operating pretax income; $2.18 of operating earnings per share and through the first-half nearly $3.5 billion of free cash flow. In the second quarter, we had modest revenue growth at constant currency, and that includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested last year. Currency rates continue to be a headwind to growth with dollar strengthening over the last 90-days; currency impacted our reported revenue growth by 80 basis points, which is about a 0.5 point worse than what spot rates suggested in April. As is typical, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue performance was again led by software and consulting. These are growth factors that together represent about three quarters of IBM's revenue and contribute to a solid base of recurring revenue and profit. Software revenue was up 8% with good growth across both, hybrid platform and solutions, led by Red Hat and Data & AI and Transaction Processing. IBM Consulting revenue growth of 6% was also broad-based, with growth across all three lines of business and geographies. Our infrastructure revenue in any quarter reflects product cycle dynamics. Infrastructure revenue was down 14%. This, as expected, had a disproportional impact to IBM's overall revenue growth this quarter, given the very successful launch of z16 in the second quarter last year. Looking at the two-year compounded growth rate, infrastructure revenue was up. Turning to our profit metrics, operating gross margin expanded 140 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and productivity. We had good performance this quarter with gross margin improvements in every reportable segment. Our operating pre-tax margin was down 70 basis points. Last year we had a gain of about $230 million from the sale of our healthcare software assets. Without the year-to-year impact of the divestiture gains, our operating pre-tax margin was up 70 basis points. This is a better indication of our ongoing operational performance. Let me comment on a couple of items within our expense profile that impacted our pre-tax income performance. As we discussed in the last couple of earnings calls, we address the remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions, resulting in a higher level of workforce rebalancing activity this year, about $115 million in the quarter. Workforce rebalancing impacted our year-to-year pre-tax margin expansion by another 60 basis points. And then currency remained a year-to-year headwind, not only to revenue, but also to our expense and pre-tax profit. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pre-tax profit growth by about $150 million and operating PTI margin by about 80 basis points year to year. As I've discussed in the past, this disproportionately impacts our product-based businesses. We have good momentum in our underlying operational profit performance. I mentioned a strong business mix, but we're also making progress on our productivity initiatives. We're digitally transforming IBM as Client Zero simplifying workflows, and deploying AI across our processes. From IT operations to HR to source-to-pay. The productivity benefits free-up spend for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion. Turning to free cash flow, we generated $2.1 billion in the quarter and nearly $3.5 billion in the first-half. This first-half performance is up over $100 million year-to-year and keeps us on track to our full-year expectation. Growth is driven by the cash from our profit performance, working capital efficiencies, and lower payments for structural actions. This was mitigated by higher performance-based compensation payments, given last year's strong results and higher cash taxes. In terms of cash uses through the first-half, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and spent about $350 million to acquire six companies. Later this year, we expect to close the acquisition of Apptio, which complements and advances our IT automation capabilities. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to have very strong liquidity position with over $16 billion of cash that's down over $1 billion since March, and up $7.5 billion since December. Our debt balance at the end of the second quarter was over $57 billion, which is up $6.5 billion from year-end. You'll recall earlier in the year, we were opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities, as well as capital allocation priorities. Turning to the segments, software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing grew, as clients leverage our hybrid cloud and AI platform capabilities. This performance again reflects growth across both our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue, as well as transactional revenue. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 7%, fueled by growth in Red Hat, Data & AI, and automation. Our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR is now over $13.6 billion and up 7%, reflecting the importance of our strategic offerings with our clients. Red Hat revenue grew 11%. OpenShift, our leading hybrid cloud platform grew more than 30% in the quarter and now has $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Ansible also delivered double-digit growth and gained market share this quarter. In automation, revenue was up 2%, reflecting growth across integration, application servers, and business automation. As clients drive enhance business value through productivity and performance optimization. Data & AI revenue was up 11%. The broad-based growth included areas like data management and business analytics, giving enterprise needs for data visualization, organization, analysis, and insights as the underpinnings for AI workloads. Security revenue declined 1%. We delivered growth in security software, driven by data security with Guardium Insights. This was more than offset by declines in security services this quarter. In Transaction Processing, revenue grew 10% off of an easier compare last year. The increase in zSystems installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and strong software renewal rates reflect the importance of zSystems platform in a hybrid cloud environment. These dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue opportunity again this quarter. Putting this together with price increases, we had strong performance in transaction processing. Moving to profit for the software segment, our pre-tax margin was up by 0.5 point, while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency. We delivered operating leverage, given both the revenue scale and mix this quarter. Consulting revenue was up 6%. In April, we discussed that we were seeing sustained demand for larger transformations that delivered meaningful ROI. At the same time, other projects considered to be more discretionary predominantly in the United States. The second quarter client buying behavior played out much in the same way. Our signings were solid, up over 20% with double-digit growth in both large and small engagements. This takes our book-to-bill ratio up to 1.1 over the last 12 months. We address continued demand for technology-driven transformations as clients prioritize projects that drive cost savings and increase productivity. Turning to our lines of business and consulting, growth across our service offerings was broad-based. Business transformation grew 5%, driven by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Digital transformations continue to be underpinned by clients embracing a hybrid cloud strategy. Technology consulting grew 5% and application operations grew 8%, as we again saw strength in cloud-based application services across development, modernization, and management. Contributing to growth across the business, our strategic partnerships grew signings and revenue double-digits with solid performance from partnerships with AWS and Azure. Our Red Hat practice also grew signings and revenue double-digits. We have an annualized revenue run rate in excess of $2 billion. Moving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pre-tax margins a 180 basis points. Our margin expansion is a reflection of the pricing and productivity actions we've taken, more than offsetting the increased labor costs and investments. Turning to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was down 14%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. This impacted both hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support. Within hybrid infrastructure, the zSystems revenue declined 30%. We've wrapped on strong revenue performance last year, up 77%, when z16 launched in the seasonally strong quarter. Through the first five quarters of availability, revenue is well ahead of prior cycles. The z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilience security, and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. For example, clients are adopting IBM's z16 and the Telum processor as the foundation for real-time AI insights across significant volumes of data. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 6%. Let me remind you, we are wrapping on strong growth last year, up 17% driven by strength in Storage and Power10 high-end systems. Moving to infrastructure profit, we expanded gross margins 200 basis points, while pre-tax margin was down 40 basis points, including about 1 point of impact from currency. Now that I've gone through the segment results, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our first-half performance, with momentum in our growth vectors of software and consulting and a solid recurring revenue base driven by our high-value software. We're delivering strong gross margin performance, with growth across our segments driven by portfolio mix and productivity. Our overall year-to-year profit dynamics as expected reflect the impact of last year's divestiture. As we look to the full-year of 2023, we're holding our view of the year on our two primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. We see constant-currency revenue growth of 3% to 5% and we expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which I'll remind you is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Let me comment on a few items within these full-year expectations. We expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year, driven by a combination of product mix and progress on our productivity initiatives. That's consistent with our view 90-days ago and in line with our model. We're also maintaining our view of our tax rate for the year, which is in the mid-to-high teens range. And then finally, while there has been some volatility in currency rates over the last couple of weeks, at current spot rates, currency translation is still expected to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the rap on last year's hedging gains, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pre-tax margin expansion. In terms of segment dynamics, in software, we had a good first half and now expect revenue growth at the high end of software's mid-single-digit model. This is all-in including acquisitions. Our revenue growth drives operating leverage with software pre-tax margin expected to expand 1.5 points to 2 points year-to-year. In consulting, we\u2019ve reposition our business to address today's clients' needs. What we saw in the second quarter didn't change our view of the year. We continue to expect consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%. And to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least 1 point. And then for infrastructure, as I described in the past, revenue is roughly flat over the mid-term model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. In the second quarter, we have wrapped on the z16 introduction in a seasonally strong quarter. For the year as you expect 2023 infrastructure revenue will decline, impacting IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. We continue to expect pre-tax margin in the low-teens. Our expectations for 2023 reflect a higher-growth, higher-value business with strong cash generation, what we have referred to as today's IBM. The analysts' estimates also reflect these dynamics. And as we look at the third quarter, the average of analysts' estimates looks reasonable. In closing, we are pleased with our first-half performance and it keeps us on track to deliver revenue growth, expand margin and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A. Patricia, let's get started.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may go ahead.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Arvind, you noted some initial traction around AI and I was wondering, you guys have made a lot of major announcements around AI. I'm wondering if you can share some thoughts on AI monetization in the short to medium term. And any quantification if possible, either in terms of dollars or growth rates over \u201823 and \u201824, would be helpful? And if I could, Jim, you saw very strong transaction processing growth, you noted a few different items there. I was wondering if you could talk about how much of that is structural versus cyclical. And if transaction processing is growing this fast, does that drive upside to software revenue for the year? Or are there other areas that are offsetting? And if you could just reiterate, if Red Hat, you still expect that to grow 11% to 13%? Thank you so much.\nArvind Krishna: Wamsi, so thank you for the question. And as you noted, I'm very excited by our progress on AI, and what is going to do for our clients most importantly and then return of course for us as we monetize it. Our monetization is largely going to be through consulting and software and I'll explain that. Infrastructure will benefit, but I would not call that a direct monetization route. So let me start with consulting. If you noticed, I talked about and Jim talked about what we have done with hybrid cloud aka OpenShift in consulting, where we began with this journey in 2019, our book of business was to be precise and to round it out zero. In the first year, we signed about $1 billion of business. And at this point, we have inception to-date signed $9 billion with an annual run rate of $2 billion in consulting. I would tell you and expect that we'll play out AI in a similar way. I hesitate to call it anything else until we get six months or so down the road, in which case then we'll have more knowledge. Now on the software side, we are very, very excited by the initial reaction to the watsonx platform. the number of projects we have going on, the client interest, it really is something which we are very, very pleased by. So what's the model to think of it on? As I think about how OpenShift, which was a Red Hat product came in, in 2019, it grew literally doubled each year for the first four years. And at this point, the revenue is about 10 times of what it was and it came in. And right now we have quantified it at $1.1 billion on our annualized run rate basis. So that gives you a sense of the excitement we have around these projects, these technologies, and what it could do for us as you begin to go forward. Now third and most important, but I don't want to quantify it is the fact that AI will infuse in models every single product we have, whether it's sustainability, whether it's our database products, whether it's our consulting projects, whether it's inside the mainframe of the Telum. But I'm not including those in those first two categories. So with that, let me give it to Jim for the TPs question.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. And thanks, Wamsi, for the question. We're obviously very pleased with our overall software performance here in the second quarter accelerating to 8% at constant currency and was pretty pervasive, both acceleration in the hybrid platform and solution. And to your question, transaction processing. But you get underneath the performance double-digit in Red Hat, double-digit in Data & AI, and double-digit in our high value transaction processing business overall, which by the way gives us the confidence exiting first-half to raise our guidance and software overall to the high-end of our mid-single-digit model. Now to your question about transaction processing. We constantly talk about on these calls, the value of TP in our business model. It's a value vector 30% of software, the tremendous source of profit and cash that gives us financial flexibility to reinvest for growth overall. It also provides a tremendous incumbency position for our IBM multiplier effect. We entered the year, Arvind and I talked about we saw the inflection shift in TP in \u201923. And that was predicated on the successful mainframe programs that we've had over the last two. By the way, the last program were up 2 times our installed MIPS capacity. So we have a much more extended opportunity base to go get those strong renewal rates overall. But we said from a model perspective, we saw the inflection shift versus being down mid-single-digit, which is a tremendous drain on us, we saw low-single-digit growth. Now on top of that, just given the highly inflationary environment, we talked about we were going to get disproportional price in \u201823. Call that, I don't know, 2, 3, 4 points somewhere in that ballpark. So when you look at our first-half performance, our first half were up 8%. By the way, our first-half last year was relatively flat. It's our easier compare. So we have to acknowledge it's easier compare. We're going to enter a different -- more difficult compare in the second-half. But that 8 points of growth overall, I would say, once you normalize for the easier compare, we can grow low-single-digit on a sustainable basis. This year, just given the differentiated price position, we said we'd grow mid-single-digit. We feel very confident exiting first-half.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Wamsi. Let's go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may go ahead.\nAmit Daryanani: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Yes, I guess, I was hoping you could spend a bit of time on the consulting side and the growth did decelerate there a little bit from 8% in Q1 to 6%. I'd love to understand how does that 6% growth in consolidated Q2 stack up versus your internal expectations? And then given the deceleration we saw in June, maybe just talk about what gives you confidence that the growth rate holds up, and that's 6% to 8% range for the back half of the year when some of your peers have actually talked about that market decelerating a bit? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Amit. I'll take this one. We're actually pleased with our consulting performance. You remember you dial back 90-days ago and we saw a real change in buying behavior, particularly in the United States around discretionary project-based activity that slowed down in the month of March and that impacted our backlog -- realization in the quarter. But we've actually posted relatively strong growth, 8% in the first quarter, we had mid-teens, if I remember correctly signings growth. When we look at second quarter, we have not seen any substantive change in client buying behavior at all. So I think that's actually a positive indicator. We didn't see it, permeate across other markets around the world. Clients like us, internally I'm focused every single day, I'm getting productivity cost, quick payback ROI and our clients are looking at that. But on top of that 6% growth here in the second quarter, I think it should be noted, we delivered very strong signings growth that was pervasive both large deal, small deal. So we see continued momentum where client demand is there, where there is a value to clients, overall. And how we differentiated ourselves and I would argue we're gaining share. We grew 24% in signings in the second quarter. And that was driven by areas that you would quite expect around digital transformation, application, modernization, data and technology, AI by the way, grew 50% signings in the first quarter. So to Arvind's opening valley about AI and how we're going to monetize, this is early green shoots on some of these things. So we exited the quarter with about 1.1 book-to-bill, by the way, that's the strongest book-to-bill we've had in quite some time. Now that positions us well for the second half. We got very good strategic partnership velocity, we got very good Red Hat book of business growing strong double-digit. But we're going to continue to monitor this client buying behavior on backlog realization. That's the critical piece. And by the way, our erosion we have not seen any change or inflection shift in erosion. So we're positioned well for the second-half and that gave us confidence in our 6% to 8%, maintaining guidance for the year.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Amit. Let's take the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next is Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. You may go ahead.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, when you talked about feeling comfortable with Q3 estimates was that both the revenue and an EPS statement? And then my question is on software, I think you were looking for 200 basis point margin improvement for the year and now you're saying 150 to 200. Can you speak to that? And also when we look at the improved software revenue growth, is that just improvement in transaction processing because you're way above your forecast in Apptio or is there something beyond that? And related to that, are you modeling any substantive revenue from AI and consulting or in software this year? And why would that not impact your outlook if you were? Thank you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Hey, Toni, thank you. I'll take the first two or three or four of your questions and then I think Arvind can talk about the AI piece overall. But when you look at our software margin overall, first of all, we're taking our full-year guidance up on revenue to the high-end of our model. So that's about 1 point raise year-over-year and by the way that's all-in, as we stated in prepared remarks, including how we're very excited about the Apptio acquisition, overall. But that raise in guidance I think is a reflection of the pervasive performance we've seen in the first-half that we feel pretty confident in. We enter let's dial back, we entered the year, we said, mid-single-digit, we were coming off of PKLA, we said, we get 5 to 6 points of growth out of annuity, and we would have about a 1 point headwind on transactional. We had a pretty solid first quarter delivering above our model. We continued and accelerated that in the second quarter. And by the way, it's both transaction processing, hybrid platform and solution overall. So when you look at it, we see one, yes, Apptio, very excited. It's a high-growth company, high recurring revenue, and a highly profitable company. And we expect just given normal customary regulations of closing, we probably assume sometime early fourth quarter. So that's about 0.5 point of that raise. The remaining 0.5 point is going to be solid mid-single-digit growth on TP to my answer to Amit. And then third is we actually exited our first-half with very solid transactional growth, albeit we do understand we're going to wrap in fourth quarter on a very strong ELA cycle. But the first-half, we're seeing very strong clothing upsell that's in the mid-20% year-over-year on those expiring ELAs through the first-half. So I think it's all three pieces overall. I think, I covered both the revenue piece on the margin, Toni. That is really just the dilution effect in the first quarter of Apptio. So we called about 200 basis points for the year. Now we're putting Apptio in. We're somewhere between 150 basis points and 200 basis points. But I'll remind you, we expect a very quick accretive business as we go forward just given their profitable overall. So I'll turn it over to Arvind on the AI.\nArvind Krishna: Yes. Thanks, Jim. So Toni, I'll comment quickly on the color on revenue from AI, both in software and consulting. So as I said, in consulting, we are expecting a number of projects to get signed. By the way, as Jim mentioned, some of that is getting baked in. And you're seeing that in the strong signings that we have in consulting in the second quarter with the over 20% growth in signings, and a lot of that was indeed data and AI consulting projects. Ditto in software, I'd just note that we had double-digit growth in the data and AI subsegment of software, and no doubt that some of that is colored by clients doing more around AI with us than they have historically. So we expect to see it. But I do want us to be sort of all in, all in with 2023, including the AI color. We see software at the high end of our model, and we see consulting as in the range that Jim just laid out. So while we are very excited about it and we see a lot of traction on AI, it is included in the estimates that we just gave.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks, Toni. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next question is from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. You may go ahead.\nShannon Cross: Thank you very much. Arvind, I'm wondering, can you talk -- and I know you haven't launched it globally, but I'm sure everybody is having conversations right now. What is the interest level and understanding of AI by geography? And how do you think that sort of plays out and rolls through? And then just as a follow-up to the commentary on Apptio. I wondered if you could talk a bit more about what were sort of the key drivers of that acquisition, what KPIs we should watch for. And then I'm also curious as to how the $450 billion of anonymized data that you're gaining with that. How do you think you'll leverage that within your foundational model? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks. Shannon, great questions. So when I look at AI by geography, at one thought of simple level, I would tell you that over the last six months, the interest in AI spans across all markets, all industries. So it is a international phenomenon, not confined to the U.S. Now we've got to dig under it. Then if I look at the maturity of clients to actually have their enterprise ready to embrace AI to be able to interact with their clients, their employees, that does vary. I have to acknowledge it. The North American market is probably the most further ahead on this. I think Western Europe comes second, likely together with some of the more advanced and developed markets in South America. Following that then is Asia and all of what would we call the Global South. Japan has a strong interest, but they tend to be cautious on adopting technology, not necessarily in experimenting. In experimenting, they'll be pretty quick. And then it will go into South Asia, where always, I think technology adoption tends to lag by a year or two behind the West. So that gives you some sense of that. But that said, every government, every enterprise, every CEO, every CIO that I talk to wants to talk about AI, what it can do to their company, what should it be in their country. And all of the questions around sovereignty of models and data and privacy and not depending only on a few international players come into the conversation, and that's why we talk a lot about private models and models that can be left behind with the client, because that is coming up more and more. And so that, I hope, gives you some color on how this is going to play out. Coming to the next part of your question on Apptio. Look, the key drivers of this acquisition are pretty straightforward. When we look at and talk to CIOs, CFOs, CEOs, they're all getting worried about their spend across the hybrid landscape. What do I spend on my first public cloud? What is it on my second? What is it on a SaaS property? What am I spending on my own data centers? So to give people a virtual cockpit that really lets them span across this, not just in terms of the third-party spend, but also the people and the process spend, is something they're all deeply, deeply interested in. And more than a few CEOs I've talked to said it really gives them a handle on what's going on and where the money is being spent. That, I think, is going to play in right away. And you went right to the second value prop. With that spend data coming in across enterprises, the aggregate anonymized across the asset is the $450 billion. Now helping people benchmark, who does this better than you? Who does this process better? Who can do this with fewer total spend on a public or a private resource? It's interesting to people because benchmarks is a great way to guide oneself to better performance. We expect that over time, we'll be able to monetize that into a large language or a foundation model and be able to give people even better predictors or where they can take their spend, too. That's why we are so excited about it. And I think the last part of your question was KPIs. Look, as we look to get Apptio much more international, while our footprint is, I'll call it, maybe two-third, one-third outside the U.S. and in the U.S., they're almost inverse. So as we can put it into our distribution channel, that will be one big expansion as we go over the next year or so. The second one is we believe we have a great chance to also increase the penetration in our larger clients. So those are two big metrics while we continue the success in the growth rate they've had using their own channels.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Shannon. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next is Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. You may go ahead.\nErik Woodring: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Arvind, I'd love to dig into how you guys are thinking about M&A today. Obviously, you announced the Apptio deal a few weeks ago. That largely probably takes transformational M&A off the table, but you obviously still have some additional dry powder to make other acquisitions. So maybe if you could talk about what your appetite is for further M&A. Are you thinking about any other end markets or solutions you target now? Is valuation becoming more restrictive for you? Maybe said differently, just what's your message on M&A today post Apptio? Thanks so much.\nArvind Krishna: Erik, so I might sound somewhat repetitive to those of you who have heard me over the past two years on this topic. So if I just sort of maybe just step back and say, taking unusual actions off the table for a moment, we had talked about a total Finflex let's call it, circa $20 billion over a three-year period. That includes the ability to raise additional debt if we so desired. We've been spending circa about $3 billion a year for the last couple. So that tells you what's the capability and the flexibility that we have. You asked about valuations, and I hope my answer that tells you that we are always on the lookout, and I'll get to which categories because you asked that also. On valuations, I wouldn't call it so much that today is restrictive. What I could say is that while some of at least the reports I was reading, we're talking about valuations perhaps coming down in multiples over this year. It doesn't seem that that's the case. They've not gone up in any, kind of, tremendous way, but they have not come down. But the market is what the market is. So if we find properties that meet our criteria, and my criteria are pretty straightforward. Doesn't align with our strategy, and I'll call those areas out in a moment. Doesn't actually give us synergy, meaning can we the combined entity grow faster than the individuals could before, right, just about it in very financial terms. And if it is larger, it has to be accretive. And by larger, I mean it's not a tuck-in, meaning it's not a few hundred million. It's larger than that, then it's got to get accretive, let's say, within two years at the latest. So if it meets those criteria, it's certainly an attractive proposition. The areas we are in, we don't want to open up more strategic lane, so to speak. Our areas are hybrid cloud, data and AI, automation, cyber and those consulting properties, which in turn help these. So that's kind of the lanes we're in. And if I look at the latest one, Apptio, I'd say it kind of hits three out of my four. It hits hybrid cloud because it helps you deploy those. It is a big data and AI property because that's what they use. And it is automation because it takes out human labor cost from many of those processes. So it was actually a very, very good fit. And if any of you have suggestions for similar things, we are all ears, and you can certainly write to me.\nPatricia Murphy: Hey, thank, Eric. Let\u2019s go to the next question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Next is David Grossman with Stifel. You may go ahead.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. Arvind, you spoke extensively about the favorable impact of pricing on the transaction processing portfolio. What have you learned from repricing that portfolio? And what other segments of your business could potentially benefit from similar actions? And sorry to violate the one-question rule. But Jim, I just want a clarification. My recollection is that you had about $500 million of working capital tailwind factored into the free cash flow guide. I just want to make sure I got that right and that's the same. Thanks.\nArvind Krishna: So David, let me address the first part of your question on pricing. Look, I'd like to be careful. TP certainly benefited this year, but the biggest part of the benefit has been the mainframe cycle and the capacity and value that our clients see. Yes. Was there a price increase? Given the labor inflation of 2022 and some ongoing in \u201923, given the strong dollar, effectively, there was pricing increase, because of those factors, and that got taken well by the market, because of the value they see on that. Would I expect to see similar pricing on TP and then I'll come to other parts of both consulting and software? I doubt, David, that it will be on the same range because, definitely, I think we would all agree, \u201822 had a high inflation. And because our costs go together with the labor and the dollar, I don't think it will be as strong as that, but I would expect maybe moderate increases based on just the pricing in TP. Now consulting has also got both labor and inflation built in. And when we are seeing 6%, 8%, 10% increases in labor cost, it is, I think, appropriate to be able to pass some of that on, albeit with a lag. And you heard Jim talk in his prepared remarks about that, that is some of what is coming through in consulting. If there remains underlying labor inflation, I fully expect to be able to pass that on, again, with a bit of a lag to clients in consulting because, otherwise, that's not a healthy business to go on. I think on the rest of software, except TP, I would expect that as labor inflation is there, those elements do come in effectively on pricing, renewal rates and so on. But I'd also say it's a competitive market, and you have to remain competitively priced to where the others are. So I would say it's in those two: TP, consulting and then in other elements of the portfolio that pricing can play a role. By the way, our renewal rates are a very strong indication that these are portfolios that provide tremendous value to our clients, but we remain competitive on price.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. I mean our strategy overall has always been around pricing for value, right? But, David, just to put it in perspective, last year, we all dealt with a very -- and we're still dealing with a very highly inflationary environment that was somewhere anywhere, what, 3, 4, 5 points above history overall. That's kind of what we've been talking about is a disproportional price in \u201823. You're not going to get that every single year, to Arvind\u2019s point, but I've always said pricing optimization is a direct correlation to the value and differentiation you offer to clients. You got to bring value to clients, or they're not going to accept the pricing. And we've been seeing good take-up with our mission-critical transaction processing. Arvind talked about the human capital-based business, the consulting, et cetera. But just quickly to wrap on your second question, David. We said entering the year, remember, we came off of December, where we had a shortfall leaving much more on the balance sheet and collected in working capital. Working capital for the year is probably somewhere around $400 million to $500 million, like you said, and that's a tailwind coming off of last year. The remaining piece of the $1.2 billion of free cash flow growth year-over-year is the fundamental improvement in the operating discipline of our revenue and operating margin and cash from profit.\nPatricia Murphy: Hey, thanks, David. Let\u2019s see if we squeeze two more in. Let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Keith Bachman with BMO. You may go ahead.\nKeith Bachman: Hui, many thanks for the question. Arvind, I wanted to direct this to you, if I could. You've talked about the success you've had, even at these early stages of signing new AI offerings in the consulting side of the business? How are you thinking about the supply side of the business? And what I mean by that is, as you look at over time, the software development process, as you talked about that in Orlando, is going to become much more efficient. And so if your consulting business is really a seat-based model that drives revenue and if those developers are increasing productivity by, I don't know, 30%, 40% because it's gen AI, presumably, clients will want that back. So how do you think about the disinflationary forces associated with gen AI on delivery side of the model, which is, I think, separate and distinct from the opportunities associated with new demand sources? And Jim, if I just sneak one in to you, to if you could talk about the total MIPS growth, not just the cycle growth, but the total MIPS growth that you've recently experienced as we look out over the next couple of years. Just trying to understand what the pricing increase, how that may -- how you may be able to use pricing on TP to leverage that MIPS? That's it for me. Many thanks.\nArvind Krishna: So Keith, let me address the first part of your question. So if I look at it in the short-term, let's just walk through. What does the consulting team actually do? They spend a lot of time upfront with the business side going through business processes, worrying about how to optimize business processes, cutting across silos, coming up with data architectures, which could help the business, helping the business decide how they're going to roll forward. All of that, to be candid, holds even in a world of gen AI, assuming it gets to perfection. Now let's get to the next level. A lot of what our teams do, and it is perhaps unique to us, we tend to work on much more mission-critical systems. We tend to work much more on things which are fundamental to the business around financials, supply chain, cyber resilience and so on. Will gen AI and large language models have an impact? Absolutely. I would tell you that if I look over a five to 10-year horizon, I would agree with you that for that second part of consulting, not the first, I would agree and expect to see a 30% productivity. Now I would tell you that in that time frame, I would believe that for IBM, that's an advantage, not a disadvantage. Why? Absolutely, it's disinflationary. But if we share that with the client, that means we can win more work. And the total labor pool we need to drive an amount of revenue is lower because there is obviously value in the technology that we are using, be it for test automation or code writing. And maybe I can be a little bit boastful. I'll use that word, Keith, and talk about one example that we have. So we wrote a code assistant for Ansible, and it is part of our watsonx family. That code assistant for Ansible can help our Ansible developers, which is used as a -- I think it's the most widely adopted language for IT deployment, gets up to 60% more productive. Now that's one piece of it. IT deployment overall, I would then say, gets probably somewhere between 10% and 30% overall productivity. So that's why I think that 30% number is a good one to keep in mind. But to go across all the environments, KOBOL, Java, icon, AI models, that's going to take a few years before our clients get the full confidence around that topic.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Keith, thanks for the question. On mainframe overall, pretty pleased given where we're at, GA plus four quarters in. So we wrapped on last year. Remember, we talked a lot last year. We came out with, unlike the prior programs. We came out with a second quarter launch in a highly seasonal transactional quarter, and we grew 77% last year overall, and we wrapped on that this year. I think we printed down 30% here in the second quarter. But a two-year CGR, so far, our five quarters in its most successful program and mainframe that we've had. Now why is it important? Yes, definitely, the value we deliver to clients, whether it's embedded AI, it's scale, cyber resilient security, cloud native development, but it's important internally to us, because it's a platform that drives a multiplier effect, to your question, around transaction processing. And we've been talking about this 2 times installed MIPS shift -- MIPS capacity over the last program. That was actually the z15 program over z14 because we're only 5 quarters into z16. But if you fast forward right now into z16, five quarters in, we're 120% to 130% up on an installed MIPS capacity already. And you know the tail of that usually happens in the outer path of the next three or four quarters before we come out with the new one. So we feel pretty good, and that's why we had the confidence entering this year, Arvind, and I, to take up the transaction processing model to actually low single-digit growth from being down mid-singles. So we see that continuing. Thanks for your question.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay, we\u2019re at the top of the hour. But let\u2019s squeeze in one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. You may go ahead.\nBen Reitzes: Hey, thanks a lot. Thanks for sneaking me in there. I wanted to ask you, Arvind, in layman's terms with regard to AI, I find a lot of investors want to understand IBM's place better. And in terms of AI, where you have your consulting and then hand it off to software, are you finding that IBM is well positioned to help people pick the right models to train, to lower their cost? What is it about IBM with the consulting and software that has your unique place set for growth and some of the optimism that you sound like you have heading into next year?\nArvind Krishna: Ben, thank you for the question, and I deeply appreciate your asking it in that form. Look, when we look at -- let me start with our extreme advantage when clients have data that they like to train models on and they absolutely want to preserve the intellectual property in that data, they do not want the learnings, I mean, I can go through three forms. Almost everyone will say, look, we're not going to take our data and give it to anybody in direct form. Okay. Next, how about learnings in the model itself from the data? Do you use that implicitly or explicitly or not at all? Three, the very fact that you're asking a certain kind of question can in turn reveal information. I'll use the word from my college training of site channel information. I'm sure that all of you also understand what that word could imply. So for people who are worried about all that, which we estimate to be at least 30% of the overall AI opportunity. Think about a bank dealing with regulatory compliance. Think about a pharma company dealing with reports to the FDA. Think about a health care company worried about some, kind of, side effect on something. Think about a chemicals company worrying about their proprietary formulations, not just watson, the literature. So as you go through all of these, there are lots and lots of examples where people want to train models. Maybe it's a refinement of a larger known model. So to your point on other models, and I'll come to that. So we found that there's a lot of opportunity, and those are the questions that people are asking us. Then next, a number of people are, critically, they have great models. They're great for big public consumption. They are great because everybody kind of has the same need for productivity. But there is also a world right now from the partners we work with, there's already over 100,000 open source models in addition to the models that we IBM provide. How do you pick from those models? Which one is appropriate? And we have taken a conscious strategy that we are not going to constrain the model that our clients want. So on our consulting teams, we will work with all the models, our own open source and other models so we can help our clients decide on which is the best one for them. Look, 30-years of being here has shown us that trying to help the clients navigate through the extreme complexity of this world is helpful to us, and we can become much better advisers and gain revenue in the process. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we are going to win here and get our fair share of this market. So given that we just passed the top of the hour, let me wrap up the call. We are in a really good position as we enter the second half of the year. Solutions meet today's client needs, new innovation we are bringing to market, and there is momentum and productivity in our underlying operations. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. Sue, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you. Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. As always, I'll start with the key financial highlights of the second quarter. We delivered $15.5 billion in revenue; $2.4 billion of operating pretax income; $2.18 of operating earnings per share and through the first-half nearly $3.5 billion of free cash flow. In the second quarter, we had modest revenue growth at constant currency, and that includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested last year. Currency rates continue to be a headwind to growth with dollar strengthening over the last 90-days; currency impacted our reported revenue growth by 80 basis points, which is about a 0.5 point worse than what spot rates suggested in April. As is typical, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue performance was again led by software and consulting. These are growth factors that together represent about three quarters of IBM's revenue and contribute to a solid base of recurring revenue and profit. Software revenue was up 8% with good growth across both, hybrid platform and solutions, led by Red Hat and Data & AI and Transaction Processing. IBM Consulting revenue growth of 6% was also broad-based, with growth across all three lines of business and geographies. Our infrastructure revenue in any quarter reflects product cycle dynamics. Infrastructure revenue was down 14%. This, as expected, had a disproportional impact to IBM's overall revenue growth this quarter, given the very successful launch of z16 in the second quarter last year. Looking at the two-year compounded growth rate, infrastructure revenue was up. Turning to our profit metrics, operating gross margin expanded 140 basis points, driven by our portfolio mix and productivity. We had good performance this quarter with gross margin improvements in every reportable segment. Our operating pre-tax margin was down 70 basis points. Last year we had a gain of about $230 million from the sale of our healthcare software assets. Without the year-to-year impact of the divestiture gains, our operating pre-tax margin was up 70 basis points. This is a better indication of our ongoing operational performance. Let me comment on a couple of items within our expense profile that impacted our pre-tax income performance. As we discussed in the last couple of earnings calls, we address the remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions, resulting in a higher level of workforce rebalancing activity this year, about $115 million in the quarter. Workforce rebalancing impacted our year-to-year pre-tax margin expansion by another 60 basis points. And then currency remained a year-to-year headwind, not only to revenue, but also to our expense and pre-tax profit. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pre-tax profit growth by about $150 million and operating PTI margin by about 80 basis points year to year. As I've discussed in the past, this disproportionately impacts our product-based businesses. We have good momentum in our underlying operational profit performance. I mentioned a strong business mix, but we're also making progress on our productivity initiatives. We're digitally transforming IBM as Client Zero simplifying workflows, and deploying AI across our processes. From IT operations to HR to source-to-pay. The productivity benefits free-up spend for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion. Turning to free cash flow, we generated $2.1 billion in the quarter and nearly $3.5 billion in the first-half. This first-half performance is up over $100 million year-to-year and keeps us on track to our full-year expectation. Growth is driven by the cash from our profit performance, working capital efficiencies, and lower payments for structural actions. This was mitigated by higher performance-based compensation payments, given last year's strong results and higher cash taxes. In terms of cash uses through the first-half, we returned $3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and spent about $350 million to acquire six companies. Later this year, we expect to close the acquisition of Apptio, which complements and advances our IT automation capabilities. From a balance sheet perspective, we continue to have very strong liquidity position with over $16 billion of cash that's down over $1 billion since March, and up $7.5 billion since December. Our debt balance at the end of the second quarter was over $57 billion, which is up $6.5 billion from year-end. You'll recall earlier in the year, we were opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities, as well as capital allocation priorities. Turning to the segments, software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing grew, as clients leverage our hybrid cloud and AI platform capabilities. This performance again reflects growth across both our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue, as well as transactional revenue. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 7%, fueled by growth in Red Hat, Data & AI, and automation. Our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR is now over $13.6 billion and up 7%, reflecting the importance of our strategic offerings with our clients. Red Hat revenue grew 11%. OpenShift, our leading hybrid cloud platform grew more than 30% in the quarter and now has $1.1 billion in annual recurring revenue. Ansible also delivered double-digit growth and gained market share this quarter. In automation, revenue was up 2%, reflecting growth across integration, application servers, and business automation. As clients drive enhance business value through productivity and performance optimization. Data & AI revenue was up 11%. The broad-based growth included areas like data management and business analytics, giving enterprise needs for data visualization, organization, analysis, and insights as the underpinnings for AI workloads. Security revenue declined 1%. We delivered growth in security software, driven by data security with Guardium Insights. This was more than offset by declines in security services this quarter. In Transaction Processing, revenue grew 10% off of an easier compare last year. The increase in zSystems installed capacity over the last couple of cycles and strong software renewal rates reflect the importance of zSystems platform in a hybrid cloud environment. These dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue opportunity again this quarter. Putting this together with price increases, we had strong performance in transaction processing. Moving to profit for the software segment, our pre-tax margin was up by 0.5 point, while absorbing over 1 point of impact from currency. We delivered operating leverage, given both the revenue scale and mix this quarter. Consulting revenue was up 6%. In April, we discussed that we were seeing sustained demand for larger transformations that delivered meaningful ROI. At the same time, other projects considered to be more discretionary predominantly in the United States. The second quarter client buying behavior played out much in the same way. Our signings were solid, up over 20% with double-digit growth in both large and small engagements. This takes our book-to-bill ratio up to 1.1 over the last 12 months. We address continued demand for technology-driven transformations as clients prioritize projects that drive cost savings and increase productivity. Turning to our lines of business and consulting, growth across our service offerings was broad-based. Business transformation grew 5%, driven by data and technology transformations, including AI and analytics-focused projects. Digital transformations continue to be underpinned by clients embracing a hybrid cloud strategy. Technology consulting grew 5% and application operations grew 8%, as we again saw strength in cloud-based application services across development, modernization, and management. Contributing to growth across the business, our strategic partnerships grew signings and revenue double-digits with solid performance from partnerships with AWS and Azure. Our Red Hat practice also grew signings and revenue double-digits. We have an annualized revenue run rate in excess of $2 billion. Moving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pre-tax margins a 180 basis points. Our margin expansion is a reflection of the pricing and productivity actions we've taken, more than offsetting the increased labor costs and investments. Turning to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was down 14%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. This impacted both hybrid infrastructure and infrastructure support. Within hybrid infrastructure, the zSystems revenue declined 30%. We've wrapped on strong revenue performance last year, up 77%, when z16 launched in the seasonally strong quarter. Through the first five quarters of availability, revenue is well ahead of prior cycles. The z16 brings the power of embedded AI at scale, cyber resilience security, and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud to our clients. For example, clients are adopting IBM's z16 and the Telum processor as the foundation for real-time AI insights across significant volumes of data. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 6%. Let me remind you, we are wrapping on strong growth last year, up 17% driven by strength in Storage and Power10 high-end systems. Moving to infrastructure profit, we expanded gross margins 200 basis points, while pre-tax margin was down 40 basis points, including about 1 point of impact from currency. Now that I've gone through the segment results, let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our first-half performance, with momentum in our growth vectors of software and consulting and a solid recurring revenue base driven by our high-value software. We're delivering strong gross margin performance, with growth across our segments driven by portfolio mix and productivity. Our overall year-to-year profit dynamics as expected reflect the impact of last year's divestiture. As we look to the full-year of 2023, we're holding our view of the year on our two primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. We see constant-currency revenue growth of 3% to 5% and we expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which I'll remind you is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Let me comment on a few items within these full-year expectations. We expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year, driven by a combination of product mix and progress on our productivity initiatives. That's consistent with our view 90-days ago and in line with our model. We're also maintaining our view of our tax rate for the year, which is in the mid-to-high teens range. And then finally, while there has been some volatility in currency rates over the last couple of weeks, at current spot rates, currency translation is still expected to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the rap on last year's hedging gains, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pre-tax margin expansion. In terms of segment dynamics, in software, we had a good first half and now expect revenue growth at the high end of software's mid-single-digit model. This is all-in including acquisitions. Our revenue growth drives operating leverage with software pre-tax margin expected to expand 1.5 points to 2 points year-to-year. In consulting, we've reposition our business to address today's clients' needs. What we saw in the second quarter didn't change our view of the year. We continue to expect consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8%. And to expand consulting pre-tax margin by at least 1 point. And then for infrastructure, as I described in the past, revenue is roughly flat over the mid-term model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. In the second quarter, we have wrapped on the z16 introduction in a seasonally strong quarter. For the year as you expect 2023 infrastructure revenue will decline, impacting IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. We continue to expect pre-tax margin in the low-teens. Our expectations for 2023 reflect a higher-growth, higher-value business with strong cash generation, what we have referred to as today's IBM. The analysts' estimates also reflect these dynamics. And as we look at the third quarter, the average of analysts' estimates looks reasonable. In closing, we are pleased with our first-half performance and it keeps us on track to deliver revenue growth, expand margin and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A. Patricia, let's get started. Thanks, Arvind. And thanks, Wamsi, for the question. We're obviously very pleased with our overall software performance here in the second quarter accelerating to 8% at constant currency and was pretty pervasive, both acceleration in the hybrid platform and solution. And to your question, transaction processing. But you get underneath the performance double-digit in Red Hat, double-digit in Data & AI, and double-digit in our high value transaction processing business overall, which by the way gives us the confidence exiting first-half to raise our guidance and software overall to the high-end of our mid-single-digit model. Now to your question about transaction processing. We constantly talk about on these calls, the value of TP in our business model. It's a value vector 30% of software, the tremendous source of profit and cash that gives us financial flexibility to reinvest for growth overall. It also provides a tremendous incumbency position for our IBM multiplier effect. We entered the year, Arvind and I talked about we saw the inflection shift in TP in '23. And that was predicated on the successful mainframe programs that we've had over the last two. By the way, the last program were up 2 times our installed MIPS capacity. So we have a much more extended opportunity base to go get those strong renewal rates overall. But we said from a model perspective, we saw the inflection shift versus being down mid-single-digit, which is a tremendous drain on us, we saw low-single-digit growth. Now on top of that, just given the highly inflationary environment, we talked about we were going to get disproportional price in \u201823. Call that, I don't know, 2, 3, 4 points somewhere in that ballpark. So when you look at our first-half performance, our first half were up 8%. By the way, our first-half last year was relatively flat. It's our easier compare. So we have to acknowledge it's easier compare. We're going to enter a different -- more difficult compare in the second-half. But that 8 points of growth overall, I would say, once you normalize for the easier compare, we can grow low-single-digit on a sustainable basis. This year, just given the differentiated price position, we said we'd grow mid-single-digit. We feel very confident exiting first-half. Thanks, Amit. I'll take this one. We're actually pleased with our consulting performance. You remember you dial back 90-days ago and we saw a real change in buying behavior, particularly in the United States around discretionary project-based activity that slowed down in the month of March and that impacted our backlog -- realization in the quarter. But we've actually posted relatively strong growth, 8% in the first quarter, we had mid-teens, if I remember correctly signings growth. When we look at second quarter, we have not seen any substantive change in client buying behavior at all. So I think that's actually a positive indicator. We didn't see it, permeate across other markets around the world. Clients like us, internally I'm focused every single day, I'm getting productivity cost, quick payback ROI and our clients are looking at that. But on top of that 6% growth here in the second quarter, I think it should be noted, we delivered very strong signings growth that was pervasive both large deal, small deal. So we see continued momentum where client demand is there, where there is a value to clients, overall. And how we differentiated ourselves and I would argue we're gaining share. We grew 24% in signings in the second quarter. And that was driven by areas that you would quite expect around digital transformation, application, modernization, data and technology, AI by the way, grew 50% signings in the first quarter. So to Arvind's opening valley about AI and how we're going to monetize, this is early green shoots on some of these things. So we exited the quarter with about 1.1 book-to-bill, by the way, that's the strongest book-to-bill we've had in quite some time. Now that positions us well for the second half. We got very good strategic partnership velocity, we got very good Red Hat book of business growing strong double-digit. But we're going to continue to monitor this client buying behavior on backlog realization. That's the critical piece. And by the way, our erosion we have not seen any change or inflection shift in erosion. So we're positioned well for the second-half and that gave us confidence in our 6% to 8%, maintaining guidance for the year. Hey, Toni, thank you. I'll take the first two or three or four of your questions and then I think Arvind can talk about the AI piece overall. But when you look at our software margin overall, first of all, we're taking our full-year guidance up on revenue to the high-end of our model. So that's about 1 point raise year-over-year and by the way that's all-in, as we stated in prepared remarks, including how we're very excited about the Apptio acquisition, overall. But that raise in guidance I think is a reflection of the pervasive performance we've seen in the first-half that we feel pretty confident in. We enter let's dial back, we entered the year, we said, mid-single-digit, we were coming off of PKLA, we said, we get 5 to 6 points of growth out of annuity, and we would have about a 1 point headwind on transactional. We had a pretty solid first quarter delivering above our model. We continued and accelerated that in the second quarter. And by the way, it's both transaction processing, hybrid platform and solution overall. So when you look at it, we see one, yes, Apptio, very excited. It's a high-growth company, high recurring revenue, and a highly profitable company. And we expect just given normal customary regulations of closing, we probably assume sometime early fourth quarter. So that's about 0.5 point of that raise. The remaining 0.5 point is going to be solid mid-single-digit growth on TP to my answer to Amit. And then third is we actually exited our first-half with very solid transactional growth, albeit we do understand we're going to wrap in fourth quarter on a very strong ELA cycle. But the first-half, we're seeing very strong clothing upsell that's in the mid-20% year-over-year on those expiring ELAs through the first-half. So I think it's all three pieces overall. I think, I covered both the revenue piece on the margin, Toni. That is really just the dilution effect in the first quarter of Apptio. So we called about 200 basis points for the year. Now we're putting Apptio in. We're somewhere between 150 basis points and 200 basis points. But I'll remind you, we expect a very quick accretive business as we go forward just given their profitable overall. So I'll turn it over to Arvind on the AI. Yes. I mean our strategy overall has always been around pricing for value, right? But, David, just to put it in perspective, last year, we all dealt with a very -- and we're still dealing with a very highly inflationary environment that was somewhere anywhere, what, 3, 4, 5 points above history overall. That's kind of what we've been talking about is a disproportional price in \u201823. You're not going to get that every single year, to Arvind's point, but I've always said pricing optimization is a direct correlation to the value and differentiation you offer to clients. You got to bring value to clients, or they're not going to accept the pricing. And we've been seeing good take-up with our mission-critical transaction processing. Arvind talked about the human capital-based business, the consulting, et cetera. But just quickly to wrap on your second question, David. We said entering the year, remember, we came off of December, where we had a shortfall leaving much more on the balance sheet and collected in working capital. Working capital for the year is probably somewhere around $400 million to $500 million, like you said, and that's a tailwind coming off of last year. The remaining piece of the $1.2 billion of free cash flow growth year-over-year is the fundamental improvement in the operating discipline of our revenue and operating margin and cash from profit. Yes. Keith, thanks for the question. On mainframe overall, pretty pleased given where we're at, GA plus four quarters in. So we wrapped on last year. Remember, we talked a lot last year. We came out with, unlike the prior programs. We came out with a second quarter launch in a highly seasonal transactional quarter, and we grew 77% last year overall, and we wrapped on that this year. I think we printed down 30% here in the second quarter. But a two-year CGR, so far, our five quarters in its most successful program and mainframe that we've had. Now why is it important? Yes, definitely, the value we deliver to clients, whether it's embedded AI, it's scale, cyber resilient security, cloud native development, but it's important internally to us, because it's a platform that drives a multiplier effect, to your question, around transaction processing. And we've been talking about this 2 times installed MIPS shift -- MIPS capacity over the last program. That was actually the z15 program over z14 because we're only 5 quarters into z16. But if you fast forward right now into z16, five quarters in, we're 120% to 130% up on an installed MIPS capacity already. And you know the tail of that usually happens in the outer path of the next three or four quarters before we come out with the new one. So we feel pretty good, and that's why we had the confidence entering this year, Arvind, and I, to take up the transaction processing model to actually low single-digit growth from being down mid-singles. So we see that continuing. Thanks for your question."

            "content": "Thank you for being here. Our second quarter results reflect continued solid execution of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We again had strength in our growth vectors of software and consulting and solid cash generation, consistent with our financial model. Clients and partners continue to view technology as a source of competitive advantage. Clients turn to us to speed up their transformation journeys, modernize applications and optimize their business workflows. At the same time, they continue to prioritize projects that focus on productivity and deliver quick time to value. To seize this opportunity, we are bringing new innovations to market, expanding strategic partnerships, and making investments in targeted growth markets, while unlocking value through our productivity initiatives. All of this gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full-year expectations for revenue and free cash flow, which remain our two primary areas of focus. We've made progress in our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI, the two key drivers of business innovation. Hybrid cloud is the most widespread form of IT architecture. Red Hat OpenShift, our leading container platform based on open-source innovations plays a crucial role in making this possible along with IBM software and infrastructure. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed-up clients' digital transformation journeys and help drive adoption of our technology platforms. Our broad ecosystem of partners amplifies our reach and ability to meet client demand. Let me highlight a few collaborations from this past quarter that take advantage of our platform-centric approach. We're helping Air Canada, improve its digital footprint, including their website, mobile application, and loyalty program. Using a hybrid cloud approach helps Air Canada better connect and tap into their commercial, operational, and financial data. With Diageo, IBM Consulting embarked on a large global digital transformation to improve customer satisfaction, optimize business workflows, and enhance its financial performance reporting capabilities. We also forged a strategic partnership with Nokia, where Red Hat OpenShift becomes the preferred platform provider to Nokia's core network applications business. This past quarter, we made strategic moves to bolster our hybrid cloud and AI capabilities with the announcement of our plans to acquire Apptio, which offer the virtual command center for CEOs, CFOs, and CIOs to manage their technology investments. Apptio's offerings combined with IBM's IT automation software and our AI capabilities, will give clients the most comprehensive approach to optimize their IT environments. AI is a transformative technology that has the potential to unlock tremendous business value. According to a recent McKinsey study, AI could add up to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. Our focus is on enterprise AI, designed to address these opportunities and solve business problems. The list of use cases is long and includes IT operations, code generation, improved automation, customer service, augmenting HR, predictive maintenance, financial forecasting, fraud detection, compliance monitoring, security, sales, risk management, and supply chain amongst others. AI is being infused into our software products. We are already building products that address specific enterprise use cases such as digital labor with Watson Orchestrate, customer service with Watson Assistant, and co-generation with Watson Code Assistant. And our Think Conference in May, we announced what's the next, our enterprise-ready AI and data platform to help clients and partners, capitalize on the AI opportunity. Watsonx delivers the value of foundational models to the enterprise, enabling them to be more productive. We began to rollout watsonx, a little over a week ago and we are excited by the client response. To-date, the platform has been shaped by more than 150 businesses across industries from telco to banking. Businesses around the world are excited about tapping foundation models and machine learning in one place, with their own data to accelerate generative AI workloads. For example, Samsung is exploring generative AI to deliver unprecedented innovation for clients. Citi is pursuing the potential use of large language models for connecting controls to internal processes. NatWest is embedding watsonx into its chatbot to improve customer experience and SAP is integrating IBM Watson AI into their solutions. IBM is also working with an expanding ecosystem of partners to co-create and innovate across industries and use cases from space to sports, including work with NASA to build the first foundation models for analyzing geospatial data and Wimbledon, where watsonx was used to produce tennis commentary. Large language models are a step-change in the evolution of AI, with more than 80% of enterprises exploring their use. We believe the opportunity for large language models for enterprises is immense. Given the existing amount of business data, this includes sensor data, chemistry data, material data, geospatial data, code, and of course, speech. Because enterprise AI draws from both public and private data, it is more effectively trained and companies adopt a hybrid cloud approach. Enterprise AI can also be based on multiple models, including public, private, and open-source. Our watsonx platform takes into account this reality and is differentiated in a few important ways. For instance, instead of relying on a single model watsonx enables companies to leverage the best models to meet their needs, whether they are open-source technologies, IBM's models, or those co-created with us. Another fundamental aspect of watsonx is trust, ensuring transparency and bias free models. In addition, beyond offering companies the capability to tap into existing AI models, IBM empowers them to create their own. To help clients on this journey, we have over 20,000 data and AI consultants and recently launched our new Center of Excellence for generative AI, already staffed with more than a 1,000 consultants with specialized generative AI expertise. The investments we're making in products and skills will help us to seize the AI opportunity. Our path is clear, in the same way we have built a consulting practice around Red Hat's hybrid cloud platform, that is now measured in the billions of dollars, we will do the same with AI. And just like OpenShift is the technology platform at the heart of our hybrid cloud capabilities, watsonx will be the core technology platform for our AI capabilities. Watsonx is just one of many new technology innovations. Shortly after previewing watsonx at our Think Conference at the Red Hat Summit, we introduced OpenShift AI, which is a unified solution to train, serve, monitor, and manage the lifecycle of AI models and applications. We also unveiled IBM hybrid cloud mesh, a SaaS solution that streamlines application-centric connectivity for edge, hybrid, and multi-cloud environments. To help clients with their sustainability agendas, we launched our AI-powered cloud-based tool that helps clients track their greenhouse gas emissions for cloud workloads. And as an example of how we continue to push the boundaries of innovation, IBM recently demonstrated using error mitigating techniques, quantum computers can produce results at a scale of 100-plus cubits. This is a significant breakthrough that firmly puts us on a path towards building practical quantum computers that can solve hard problems in areas such as risk, finance, and materials. Let me conclude by reiterating our confidence in our strategy and execution. It is clear that the work we have done to better align IBM to the needs of our clients is paying off. The momentum in our business and continued focus on productivity, position us to achieve our full-year expectations and deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth. With that, I would like to hand it over to Jim who will delve deeper into our performance and expectations. Wamsi, so thank you for the question. And as you noted, I'm very excited by our progress on AI, and what is going to do for our clients most importantly and then return of course for us as we monetize it. Our monetization is largely going to be through consulting and software and I'll explain that. Infrastructure will benefit, but I would not call that a direct monetization route. So let me start with consulting. If you noticed, I talked about and Jim talked about what we have done with hybrid cloud aka OpenShift in consulting, where we began with this journey in 2019, our book of business was to be precise and to round it out zero. In the first year, we signed about $1 billion of business. And at this point, we have inception to-date signed $9 billion with an annual run rate of $2 billion in consulting. I would tell you and expect that we'll play out AI in a similar way. I hesitate to call it anything else until we get six months or so down the road, in which case then we'll have more knowledge. Now on the software side, we are very, very excited by the initial reaction to the watsonx platform. the number of projects we have going on, the client interest, it really is something which we are very, very pleased by. So what's the model to think of it on? As I think about how OpenShift, which was a Red Hat product came in, in 2019, it grew literally doubled each year for the first four years. And at this point, the revenue is about 10 times of what it was and it came in. And right now we have quantified it at $1.1 billion on our annualized run rate basis. So that gives you a sense of the excitement we have around these projects, these technologies, and what it could do for us as you begin to go forward. Now third and most important, but I don't want to quantify it is the fact that AI will infuse in models every single product we have, whether it's sustainability, whether it's our database products, whether it's our consulting projects, whether it's inside the mainframe of the Telum. But I'm not including those in those first two categories. So with that, let me give it to Jim for the TPs question. Yes. Thanks, Jim. So Toni, I'll comment quickly on the color on revenue from AI, both in software and consulting. So as I said, in consulting, we are expecting a number of projects to get signed. By the way, as Jim mentioned, some of that is getting baked in. And you're seeing that in the strong signings that we have in consulting in the second quarter with the over 20% growth in signings, and a lot of that was indeed data and AI consulting projects. Ditto in software, I'd just note that we had double-digit growth in the data and AI subsegment of software, and no doubt that some of that is colored by clients doing more around AI with us than they have historically. So we expect to see it. But I do want us to be sort of all in, all in with 2023, including the AI color. We see software at the high end of our model, and we see consulting as in the range that Jim just laid out. So while we are very excited about it and we see a lot of traction on AI, it is included in the estimates that we just gave. Thanks. Shannon, great questions. So when I look at AI by geography, at one thought of simple level, I would tell you that over the last six months, the interest in AI spans across all markets, all industries. So it is a international phenomenon, not confined to the U.S. Now we've got to dig under it. Then if I look at the maturity of clients to actually have their enterprise ready to embrace AI to be able to interact with their clients, their employees, that does vary. I have to acknowledge it. The North American market is probably the most further ahead on this. I think Western Europe comes second, likely together with some of the more advanced and developed markets in South America. Following that then is Asia and all of what would we call the Global South. Japan has a strong interest, but they tend to be cautious on adopting technology, not necessarily in experimenting. In experimenting, they'll be pretty quick. And then it will go into South Asia, where always, I think technology adoption tends to lag by a year or two behind the West. So that gives you some sense of that. But that said, every government, every enterprise, every CEO, every CIO that I talk to wants to talk about AI, what it can do to their company, what should it be in their country. And all of the questions around sovereignty of models and data and privacy and not depending only on a few international players come into the conversation, and that's why we talk a lot about private models and models that can be left behind with the client, because that is coming up more and more. And so that, I hope, gives you some color on how this is going to play out. Coming to the next part of your question on Apptio. Look, the key drivers of this acquisition are pretty straightforward. When we look at and talk to CIOs, CFOs, CEOs, they're all getting worried about their spend across the hybrid landscape. What do I spend on my first public cloud? What is it on my second? What is it on a SaaS property? What am I spending on my own data centers? So to give people a virtual cockpit that really lets them span across this, not just in terms of the third-party spend, but also the people and the process spend, is something they're all deeply, deeply interested in. And more than a few CEOs I've talked to said it really gives them a handle on what's going on and where the money is being spent. That, I think, is going to play in right away. And you went right to the second value prop. With that spend data coming in across enterprises, the aggregate anonymized across the asset is the $450 billion. Now helping people benchmark, who does this better than you? Who does this process better? Who can do this with fewer total spend on a public or a private resource? It's interesting to people because benchmarks is a great way to guide oneself to better performance. We expect that over time, we'll be able to monetize that into a large language or a foundation model and be able to give people even better predictors or where they can take their spend, too. That's why we are so excited about it. And I think the last part of your question was KPIs. Look, as we look to get Apptio much more international, while our footprint is, I'll call it, maybe two-third, one-third outside the U.S. and in the U.S., they're almost inverse. So as we can put it into our distribution channel, that will be one big expansion as we go over the next year or so. The second one is we believe we have a great chance to also increase the penetration in our larger clients. So those are two big metrics while we continue the success in the growth rate they've had using their own channels. Erik, so I might sound somewhat repetitive to those of you who have heard me over the past two years on this topic. So if I just sort of maybe just step back and say, taking unusual actions off the table for a moment, we had talked about a total Finflex let's call it, circa $20 billion over a three-year period. That includes the ability to raise additional debt if we so desired. We've been spending circa about $3 billion a year for the last couple. So that tells you what's the capability and the flexibility that we have. You asked about valuations, and I hope my answer that tells you that we are always on the lookout, and I'll get to which categories because you asked that also. On valuations, I wouldn't call it so much that today is restrictive. What I could say is that while some of at least the reports I was reading, we're talking about valuations perhaps coming down in multiples over this year. It doesn't seem that that's the case. They've not gone up in any, kind of, tremendous way, but they have not come down. But the market is what the market is. So if we find properties that meet our criteria, and my criteria are pretty straightforward. Doesn't align with our strategy, and I'll call those areas out in a moment. Doesn't actually give us synergy, meaning can we the combined entity grow faster than the individuals could before, right, just about it in very financial terms. And if it is larger, it has to be accretive. And by larger, I mean it's not a tuck-in, meaning it's not a few hundred million. It's larger than that, then it's got to get accretive, let's say, within two years at the latest. So if it meets those criteria, it's certainly an attractive proposition. The areas we are in, we don't want to open up more strategic lane, so to speak. Our areas are hybrid cloud, data and AI, automation, cyber and those consulting properties, which in turn help these. So that's kind of the lanes we're in. And if I look at the latest one, Apptio, I'd say it kind of hits three out of my four. It hits hybrid cloud because it helps you deploy those. It is a big data and AI property because that's what they use. And it is automation because it takes out human labor cost from many of those processes. So it was actually a very, very good fit. And if any of you have suggestions for similar things, we are all ears, and you can certainly write to me. So David, let me address the first part of your question on pricing. Look, I'd like to be careful. TP certainly benefited this year, but the biggest part of the benefit has been the mainframe cycle and the capacity and value that our clients see. Yes. Was there a price increase? Given the labor inflation of 2022 and some ongoing in '23, given the strong dollar, effectively, there was pricing increase, because of those factors, and that got taken well by the market, because of the value they see on that. Would I expect to see similar pricing on TP and then I'll come to other parts of both consulting and software? I doubt, David, that it will be on the same range because, definitely, I think we would all agree, \u201822 had a high inflation. And because our costs go together with the labor and the dollar, I don't think it will be as strong as that, but I would expect maybe moderate increases based on just the pricing in TP. Now consulting has also got both labor and inflation built in. And when we are seeing 6%, 8%, 10% increases in labor cost, it is, I think, appropriate to be able to pass some of that on, albeit with a lag. And you heard Jim talk in his prepared remarks about that, that is some of what is coming through in consulting. If there remains underlying labor inflation, I fully expect to be able to pass that on, again, with a bit of a lag to clients in consulting because, otherwise, that's not a healthy business to go on. I think on the rest of software, except TP, I would expect that as labor inflation is there, those elements do come in effectively on pricing, renewal rates and so on. But I'd also say it's a competitive market, and you have to remain competitively priced to where the others are. So I would say it's in those two: TP, consulting and then in other elements of the portfolio that pricing can play a role. By the way, our renewal rates are a very strong indication that these are portfolios that provide tremendous value to our clients, but we remain competitive on price. So Keith, let me address the first part of your question. So if I look at it in the short-term, let's just walk through. What does the consulting team actually do? They spend a lot of time upfront with the business side going through business processes, worrying about how to optimize business processes, cutting across silos, coming up with data architectures, which could help the business, helping the business decide how they're going to roll forward. All of that, to be candid, holds even in a world of gen AI, assuming it gets to perfection. Now let's get to the next level. A lot of what our teams do, and it is perhaps unique to us, we tend to work on much more mission-critical systems. We tend to work much more on things which are fundamental to the business around financials, supply chain, cyber resilience and so on. Will gen AI and large language models have an impact? Absolutely. I would tell you that if I look over a five to 10-year horizon, I would agree with you that for that second part of consulting, not the first, I would agree and expect to see a 30% productivity. Now I would tell you that in that time frame, I would believe that for IBM, that's an advantage, not a disadvantage. Why? Absolutely, it's disinflationary. But if we share that with the client, that means we can win more work. And the total labor pool we need to drive an amount of revenue is lower because there is obviously value in the technology that we are using, be it for test automation or code writing. And maybe I can be a little bit boastful. I'll use that word, Keith, and talk about one example that we have. So we wrote a code assistant for Ansible, and it is part of our watsonx family. That code assistant for Ansible can help our Ansible developers, which is used as a -- I think it's the most widely adopted language for IT deployment, gets up to 60% more productive. Now that's one piece of it. IT deployment overall, I would then say, gets probably somewhere between 10% and 30% overall productivity. So that's why I think that 30% number is a good one to keep in mind. But to go across all the environments, KOBOL, Java, icon, AI models, that's going to take a few years before our clients get the full confidence around that topic. Ben, thank you for the question, and I deeply appreciate your asking it in that form. Look, when we look at -- let me start with our extreme advantage when clients have data that they like to train models on and they absolutely want to preserve the intellectual property in that data, they do not want the learnings, I mean, I can go through three forms. Almost everyone will say, look, we're not going to take our data and give it to anybody in direct form. Okay. Next, how about learnings in the model itself from the data? Do you use that implicitly or explicitly or not at all? Three, the very fact that you're asking a certain kind of question can in turn reveal information. I'll use the word from my college training of site channel information. I'm sure that all of you also understand what that word could imply. So for people who are worried about all that, which we estimate to be at least 30% of the overall AI opportunity. Think about a bank dealing with regulatory compliance. Think about a pharma company dealing with reports to the FDA. Think about a health care company worried about some, kind of, side effect on something. Think about a chemicals company worrying about their proprietary formulations, not just watson, the literature. So as you go through all of these, there are lots and lots of examples where people want to train models. Maybe it's a refinement of a larger known model. So to your point on other models, and I'll come to that. So we found that there's a lot of opportunity, and those are the questions that people are asking us. Then next, a number of people are, critically, they have great models. They're great for big public consumption. They are great because everybody kind of has the same need for productivity. But there is also a world right now from the partners we work with, there's already over 100,000 open source models in addition to the models that we IBM provide. How do you pick from those models? Which one is appropriate? And we have taken a conscious strategy that we are not going to constrain the model that our clients want. So on our consulting teams, we will work with all the models, our own open source and other models so we can help our clients decide on which is the best one for them. Look, 30-years of being here has shown us that trying to help the clients navigate through the extreme complexity of this world is helpful to us, and we can become much better advisers and gain revenue in the process. So hopefully, that gives you a sense of how we are going to win here and get our fair share of this market. So given that we just passed the top of the hour, let me wrap up the call. We are in a really good position as we enter the second half of the year. Solutions meet today's client needs, new innovation we are bringing to market, and there is momentum and productivity in our underlying operations. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year."

Ma'am, you may begin.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you. This is Patricia Murphy, and I'd like to welcome you to IBM's first quarter 2023 earnings presentation. I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM Investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue growth are at constant currency. We have provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP measures at the end of the presentation posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. More information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna : Thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results demonstrate that clients continue to turn to IBM to help them address today's business needs while positioning them for the future. We had a good start to the year with mid-single-digit revenue growth at constant currency, in line with our midterm model and growth in free cash flow. Performance was led by Software and Consulting as clients continue to accelerate their digital transformations, modernize their applications, automate their workflows, and create flexible and secure hybrid cloud environments. More recently, clients are prioritizing digital transformation projects that focus on cost takeout, productivity and quick returns. While demand for our offerings that support these priorities remains solid, we are seeing some deceleration in Consulting from the previous robust growth levels, especially in the United States. Globally, our clients continue to see technology as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Technology helps them scale and enhance productivity, which is especially important in the face of inflation, demographic shift, cybersecurity, supply chain issues and sustainability goals. All of this supports our revenue growth expectations for the year. Our focus remains on revenue growth and free cash flow. 90 days ago, I shared that in 2023, we continue to unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships and put more investment in specific growth markets. Productivity has always been an important part of our business model. It frees up spending and increases financial flexibility to enable investments. We have started to see some of this pay back in our results, which gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year free cash flow objectives. Let me spend a few minutes on the progress we have made in the execution of our strategy. Our focus is on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, the two most influential technologies for business. In tandem, these technologies drive both business outcomes and innovation. Hybrid cloud is now the most prominent form of IT architecture, and our approach is platform-centric. Red Hat OpenShift is the leading container platform, enabling clients to leverage the latest innovations in open source software. IBM's software and infrastructure have been tailored for this platform. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed up clients' digital transformation processes. In the first quarter, we co-created with more clients to unlock business value from a hybrid cloud approach. We are working with Virgin Money to migrate their credit card service to the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. They will also leverage IBM's consulting capabilities to create new digital customer experiences. For the Boston Red Sox, we are collaborating with Wasabi Technologies, leveraging hybrid cloud technologies to analyse key data sources that improve the club's operations. The second element of our strategy is top of mind for a lot of clients, artificial intelligence. AI is projected to add $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Keep in mind that AI for business is different than AI for consumers, given their need for more accurate results, trusted data and governance tools. AI techniques such as foundation models, large language models and generative AI, give businesses the ability to create 100 AI models from a single data set. Early client engagements experienced a 70% faster time to value. That is why we are seeing a lot more interest from business and using AI to boost productivity and reduce costs. Productivity gains will come from enterprises turning their workflows into simpler automated processes with AI. To achieve this, we are collaborating with companies like Citi to enhance their internal audit and compliance processes through AI. J.B. Hunt Transport use our Turbonomic AI-powered resourcing and automation engine to optimize their cloud environment. This helped reduce infrastructure refresh costs by 75%. This is a great example of the work we're doing in IT operations. In other areas such as customer care, we are automating hundreds of thousands of call center responses with AI with more than 90% accuracy and greater levels of customer satisfaction. In cybersecurity, our elite defense teams are deploying AI to defend against criminals in real time. In digital labor, we are helping finance, accounting and HR teams save thousands of hours by automating what used to be labor-intensive data entry tasks. To bring our hybrid cloud and AI strategy to market, our partner ecosystem continues to play a critical role. We expanded our partnership with Adobe to help marketing and creative organizations make the production of content easier. IBM and EY announced a collaboration using IBM software and EY's sustainability consulting practice to help companies operationalize decarbonization action plans. Juniper Networks and Nokia also recently expanded their collaboration around IBM's network intelligence and automation solutions to monetize and optimize investments in networks more effectively. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. A good example of this is the Cleveland Clinic-IBM Discovery Accelerator where multiple projects are underway that leverage the latest in quantum computing, artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud to help expedite discoveries in biomedical research. At the Cleveland Clinic, we also recently unveiled the first quantum computer dedicated to health care research. To complement our own innovations, in the first quarter, we acquired 3 companies that extend our capabilities in hybrid cloud and AI. We also continue to engage in projects that have a positive impact on society. Many clients are leveraging our technology and expertise to advance their sustainability agendas. For example, in the area of manufacturing, Siemens and IBM are announcing a new software solution that integrates software from both companies to enable sustainable product development. Sustainability is a focus area for all businesses. And just last week, we released our annual report on IBM's efforts in this area, IBM Impact. I'd encourage you to read about our progress in areas ranging from energy savings and carbon emissions reduction to skills development and increasing diversity. I'll conclude by saying that we are confident in the changes we have made to our business over the last three years, aligning our strategy, priorities and portfolio to the needs of our clients. This work, together with our continued focus on productivity, are enabling us to deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth.  I'll now hand it over to Jim who will offer more insight into our performance and expectations.\nJames Kavanaugh : Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the first quarter. We delivered $14.3 billion in revenue, $1.4 billion of operating pre-tax income, $1.36 of operating earnings per share and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up about 4.5% at constant currency. That includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested. Currency rates impacted our reported revenue growth by 4 points. That is over $100 million more than spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago. As always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue growth this quarter was led by Software and Consulting. Software revenue was up nearly 6% and Consulting up 8%. These are our growth vectors and now represent about three-quarters of our annual revenue. Our infrastructure revenue was flat with continued strength in z Systems. All three of our geographies grew, with high single-digit growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Across our business, more than half of IBM's revenue is recurring, led by high-value software which is growing at mid-single-digit rate. Looking at our profit metrics for the quarter. Operating gross margin expanded 80 basis points. We expanded gross margin in all segments with a strong portfolio mix overall. Operating pre-tax income, excluding the impact of workforce rebalancing, was up 12%, and margin expanded 130 basis points. You'll recall back in January, I mentioned we were planning to address remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions and we anticipated a charge of about $300 million. As we executed our plan, we took a charge of $260 million in the first quarter, and we expect to complete this action in the second quarter. This workforce rebalancing charge primarily addresses indirect support function. We are no longer including workforce rebalancing charges in our measure of segment profit to provide a view of our segment results consistent with our ongoing operational profile. At the IBM level, including the workforce rebalancing activity, operating pre-tax income was down 4%, and margin was down 50 basis points. Within our margin performance, we absorbed a significant currency headwind. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pre-tax profit growth by about $160 million and operating PTI margin by 70 basis points year-to-year. As I've discussed in the past, this essentially impacts our product-based businesses. Mitigating that, the change in useful lives of our server and networking equipment provides a 50 basis point year-to-year benefit to operating PTI margin, which is included primarily in our infrastructure segment. Taking it back up a level, IBM's profit performance this quarter benefits from improvements in business mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. We've been digitally transforming IBM, much in the same way we're helping our clients with their transformation, using both IBM and third-party capabilities. Think of IBM as client zero. We are driving G&A efficiencies by reimagining and transforming the way we work. This includes optimizing our infrastructure and application environments as well as redesigning our end-to-end business processes. Let me give you a few examples. Across IBM's IT environment, we're realizing the value of hybrid cloud. We reduced the average cost of running an application by 90% by moving from a legacy data center environment to a hybrid cloud environment running on Red Hat OpenShift. We've been simplifying our application environment. By standardizing global processes and applying AIOps, we are reducing our application portfolio by more than 35%. We've automated over 24 million transactions with RPA, avoiding hundreds of thousands of manual tasks and eliminating the risk of human error, and we're deploying AI at scale to reengineer our business processes. We're doing that in areas like HR and talent, finance and end-to-end processes like quote to cash and Source to Pay. For example, in HR, we now handle 94% of our company-wide HR inquiries with our AskHR digital system, speeding up the completion of many HR tasks by up to 75%. These productivity initiatives free up spending for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion. Turning to free cash flow. We generated $1.3 billion in the quarter. This is up $100 million year-to-year and puts us on track to our full year expectation. Growth is driven by our profit performance and working capital efficiencies as well as lower payments for structural action. This was mitigated by an increase in capital expenditures and higher performance-based compensation payments, given last year's strong results. In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash over $17 billion, which is up nearly $9 billion from December. We have been opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt early in the year to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was over $58 billion, up nearly $8 billion from year-end. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew nearly 6%, in line with software's mid-single-digit model. We had growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and transaction processing. This performance captures the benefits of our growing recurring revenue stream, which is about 80% of annual software revenue with continued strong renewal rates. This, together with growth in software transactions this quarter demonstrates clients' commitment to our hybrid cloud and AI platforms. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 5%, fueled by growth across all business areas. We continue to see client demand for broad capabilities across Red Hat, automation, data in AI and security. Red Hat revenue grew 11% with growth across all major offerings. We have particular strength in our hybrid cloud platform, OpenShift; and Ansible, our IT automation solution. Both offerings also continue to take market share this quarter. Automation revenue was up 2%, driven by integration and application servers, given client demand for improved IT performance and costs. In data and AI, revenue grew 3%, reflecting growth across data management, business analytics and asset and supply chain management. Many of these offerings, like Db2, serve as the underpinnings for modern AI and mission-critical workloads. Security revenue was up 2% with growth across security for hybrid cloud, which includes both identity and threat management and security for data. Bringing this all together, our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR is now at $13.5 billion. In transaction processing, revenue grew 6.5%. The software remains core to our clients' hybrid cloud strategies. The strong performance over the last couple of system cycles drove significant capacity growth. In fact, installed MIPS growth during our z15 cycle was 2x that of z14. This translates to software opportunity and contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional revenue. Layering in this year's price increases, we delivered good performance in Transaction Processing this quarter. Moving to profit for the Software segment. Gross margin was up and pre-tax margin was flat this quarter with the latter absorbing nearly 1 point of impact from currency. Consulting revenue was up 8% and I'll remind you, we had a strong growth in the first quarter of last year. Our book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months was 1.07. Signings in the quarter grew 7% with similar performance across both larger and smaller engagements. We continue to see broad demand for projects that deliver technology-driven transformation, leveraging a hybrid cloud environment. Within the quarter, demand was solid for cloud modernization offerings, and we had one of our largest Red Hat signings quarters ever. More recently, clients are particularly focused on driving productivity and cost reductions with greater agility and faster time to value. This is contributing to signings growth from digital transformations in areas such as talent, finance and supply chain transformation. In terms of revenue, while we had solid growth overall, we have seen some clients in the U.S. pull back on more discretionary projects, impacting backlog realization within the quarter. Bringing it back up to the global level, Business Transformation grew 6%, Technology Consulting grew 4% and Application Operations grew 13%. Revenue growth was led by data and customer experience transformation project, in addition to cloud application development and management. Our hybrid cloud expertise and depth and breadth of strategic partnerships differentiate IBM Consulting in today's market. Red Hat consulting revenue, now over $2 billion annually, continue to grow at a double-digit rate. And our strategic partnerships continued strong growth, making up over 35% of our revenue in this segment over the last 12 months. Moving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pre-tax margins. Our pre-tax margin of about 8% in the quarter was up 50 basis points year-to-year as we continue to benefit from the productivity actions we've taken. Turning to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was flat. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue was up 4% and Infrastructure Support revenue was down 4%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, z Systems revenue was up 11%. This was a fourth quarter of z16 availability, and the solid program performance has outpaced that of prior cycles. In addition to capabilities around embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security, clients are also leveraging z16 for its energy efficiency. For example, consolidating Linux workloads on a single z16 system can reduce energy consumption by up to 75%. We continue to see strong growth in shipped MIPS for new Linux workloads on z16. Distributed infrastructure revenue was flat. Growth in storage was offset by declines in power as we have wrapped on the launch of the Power10 high-end systems.  Moving to infrastructure profit. We expanded both gross and pre-tax margins. The 80 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin reflects benefits from both the z Systems' product cycle and changes in useful life, partially offset by nearly 2 points of currency impact. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. When we first introduced today's IBM back in October of 2021, we provided a midterm model for revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth. We delivered on that model throughout last year and now have a good start to 2023. In the first quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, expanded gross margin, drove productivity in our underlying business and grew our free cash flow. Looking at full year 2023, as always, I'll start with our two primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. On the top line, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. And we continue to expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Inherent in our midterm model is margin expansion, driven by improving business mix, efficiency initiatives and productivity enhancement. Driving efficiency and productivity has always been a part of our operating and financial models. I mentioned some of the initiatives we have underway and we continue to evaluate additional actions. Altogether, the current initiatives are expected to deliver $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. These initiatives provide additional flexibility, enabling reinvestment in the business to support future growth, contributing to margin expansion and increasing financial flexibility. Let me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pretax profit performance by segment. In Software, we continue to expect revenue growth in line with software's mid-single-digit model. This revenue growth drives operating leverage, and we still expect software pre-tax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. In Consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations and application modernization. So as I said, we are seeing some pressure on more discretionary projects in the United States. We now see Consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and continue to expect to expand Consulting pre-tax margin by at least 1 point as we capitalize on the yield of our productivity actions. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're about to wrap on the z16 introduction. As a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue to decline with pre-tax margin in the low teens. To provide some perspective, Infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year. That's in line with our model. And we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the mid- to high teens range. As I mentioned earlier, the dollar has strengthened over the last 90 days. We now expect currency translation to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year, which is about 0.5 point worse than 90 days ago. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the unwinding of last year's hedging gain, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pre-tax margin expansion. Looking at the second quarter, we expect first to second quarter revenue seasonality to be fairly consistent with last year. That's up about $1.3 billion, though the underlying dynamics are different due primarily to z Systems' product cycle and currency. I'll remind you, we had a successful launch of our z16 in the second quarter of last year, and that creates a year-to-year headwind to growth of about 3 points. In terms of profit, we now expect a little over 1/3 of our operating net income in the first half and just under 2/3 in the second half. This reflects a first half headwind from currency and workforce rebalancing dynamics, both of which flip to a tailwind in the second half. I mentioned the workforce rebalancing activity we have underway. Between the first and second quarter, the charge should be in the range of $300 million, maybe a little more. We still expect this action to pay back by the end of the year. In closing, we entered the year as a more focused business with solid fundamentals. We had a good start to 2023 and are positioned to deliver revenue growth, expand margins and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A. Patricia, let's get started.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation; and second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse.\nShannon Cross : Arvind, there's a significant amount of uncertainty with regard to end demand in the marketplace right now. So I'm wondering, as you speak to customers, can you talk to demand trends you're seeing both on a vertical and a geographic basis? Just give us some more color on what you're hearing because, I mean, after CDW, I know it's a different market, but there's a lot of questions out there in terms of what people are spending money on, why they want to spend and if it's going to continue in the second half.\nArvind Krishna : Shannon, thank you for the question. And as you can imagine, we spend a lot of time both digesting and making our own estimates based on what our clients are saying. So you said geography, verticals and then within technology segments, so let me try to unpack it a little. So on a geography level, a lot of the uncertainty that is in the media here, certainly in North America is not there in Asia at all. If I look across Japan, India, the Middle East, which kind of covers the broad swath of Asia, with the exception of China, we don't see any of that playing out. The geopolitics around China is a slightly different piece but I think everyone is subject to that right now. Then if I come to Europe, it's actually been stronger than I would have predicted six months ago, but that is because of my point on technology as a deflationary force. When we look at the mixture of interest rates, inflation, wage inflation, demographic, meaning labor shortages, supply chain resiliency, cyber, technology is actually the only answer companies have against all that. Now that does apply to the larger enterprises who are our primary customers. When I come to the United States, we did see some slowing down in consulting projects, as I said. But that is because consulting is somewhat discretionary. However, we are not seeing people cancel projects. What they are doing is slowing them down, meaning pushing to the right, which is why we took the numbers down for consulting, believing that, that may spread in some sense to other parts of the globe as well. Software, we are seeing demand remain very steady. We're not seeing any signs of weakness in software. Admittedly, we are in B2B software. We are not in any B2C segment. And in infrastructure, I think it's less of a macro. It's much more, in our case, a product cycle issue that is playing through. I hope that gave you some color on why we have confidence in the demand, weakness in 1 particular area, which we think will likely play through. But I want to caution that weakness is not us shrinking. It just says that double-digit rates went down into the 6% to 8%, which is still healthy.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you for the question, Shannon. Let\u2019s go to the next one please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\nAmit Daryanani : I guess I was hoping you could talk a bit more on the software side, and I think growth across both hybrid and transaction seems to be fairly good in the quarter. But Arvind, if you think about some of these consulting softness that's happening, you talked about that in North America. How do you think about the risk of that potentially spreading to some of the software side as well? So I'd love to understand, are you seeing any sense, any of that pushout happening in the software side as well? And then as you -- secondly, as you think about this mid-single-digit growth in software for the year, how do you think that stacks up between hybrid versus Transaction Processing?\nArvind Krishna : So Amit, let me just take the first part of your question on the linkage between consulting and software, and then I'll hand it to Jim for other parts of the question. So I think that if I look at the consulting, it's not going to spread to software in our belief. Remember, our consulting is comprised if you just want to break it down into sort of three parts. We work with a lot of other partners including on the public clouds, including with large software providers, and we tend to do these projects for our clients. I keep cautioning, it's slowing down but still in the 6% to 8%, not in a rate lower than that. Yes, there is a linkage to software but a lot of our software is running critical systems for our clients, and we don't see those very subject to what we see in the current macroeconomic environment. And so that's what gives us confidence on those. Also, I think the movement towards hybrid cloud and the ability to take advantage of AI for enterprise productivity is perhaps going to be a tailwind as we enter the second half of the year because I do think that clients are going to do a lot of automation and a lot of cost cutting, which will likely benefit elements of our software portfolio. Jim?\nJames Kavanaugh : Yes. So Amit, thank you very much for the question. I mean, as building on what Arvind just said, we are very pleased overall with our start to the year with regards to software here in the first quarter, nearly 6% growth at the high end of our model overall. By the way, the fundamentals of that business doing extremely well, growing gross margins 60 basis points, growing pre-tax income. But software is an integral part of not only our hybrid cloud platform thesis but also an integral part of that economic multiplier equation. $25 billion of revenue, over 40% of IBM's revenue composition, over 2/3 of IBM's profit, solid ARR $13.5 billion, growing 7% and a flywheel effect of NRR going well north of 100%. And I think linking back to Shannon's question and part of your question, Arvind's been very clear that we believe that technology is a source of competitive advantage for every industry and every client now, and we built out a portfolio to go capitalize on that. Now let's take a step back because you asked a question about revenue contribution and then the mix of Hybrid Platform & Solution versus transactional. Let's talk first about the revenue contribution. Going back 90 days ago, we laid out the year. We said we were confident in our software portfolio, growing on model. We started off the first quarter with putting a dot on the board and contributing to that level actually near the high end. But we said entering the year that we've got about 80% of our portfolio is high-value recurring revenue, annuitized revenue. And we thought that, that is going to contribute a little over 5 points of that midterm model growth -- mid-single-digit model growth. And underneath that 5 points, about half of it is going to come out of Red Hat, by the way, growing 11% to 13% for the year, and about half of that out of our recurring revenue stream from IBM, capitalizing on a very strong installed MIPS capacity and renewal rates, along with some price optimization. And by the way, first quarter played out that way.  Now Transaction, the remaining 20%, we said we definitely acknowledge we're heading into the down cycle on ELAs. And by the way, ELAs don't go up 100% one year and down. Over a three-year period, you typically get 60% in the first year and then it whittles down over the next couple of years. And we said we expect about a zero to 1-point headwind. And in the first quarter, we actually did quite well. The transactional volume actually contributed over 1 point of Software's growth. So that's kind of a build-up of the contribution between our two businesses. Now around the lines of business, Hybrid Platform & Solution, our model is anywhere from mid- to high single digit. We delivered 5% in the first quarter. And what we see for the full year is right along that model. Red Hat improving, given the performance of a renewal cycle. We've got an ARR at $13.5 billion, growing 7%. And by the way, that's a leading indicator, which is positive for us. Our Cloud Pak growth continues to be very strong, and we got new innovation that we continue to bring to market. And then Transaction Processing, very pleased overall first quarter, 6.5% growth. We believe full year is going to be somewhere in the low to mid-single digit. And again, that is capitalizing on that 2x growth in installed MIPS and those strong renewal and price. So that kind of hopefully sums up the software portfolio for your question.\nPatricia Murphy: Okay, sure. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi : I was just wondering if you could comment a little bit about Red Hat. I think I recall your guidance was for mid-teens growth for the year. And in the first quarter, it was 11% at constant currency but ex deferred revenue accounting was probably 7% or 8%. So how do we get confident that the back half of the year where there's little to no deferred revenue accounting contribution can be fundamentally like 17%, 18%, so an acceleration from 7% or 8% to 17% or 18%. And then secondly, can you comment just on the impact of software pricing? Are you only seeing that in Transaction Processing? Or are you seeing in other parts of the software business? And how should we be thinking about sort of the magnitude of the impact of price increases?\nArvind Krishna : So great questions. So let me start, and then I'm going to give it to Jim for a lot more detail. So first of all, on Red Hat, as I think Jim answered in one of the prior questions and in some of the prepared remarks as well, we are now expecting 11% to 13% for the year. That's kind of where we expect Red Hat to be. And that's an all-in number for the year that's inclusive of Q1. So Q1 was at the bottom end of that range. We are seeing more demand coming up as we go through the year. We know our cycles of renewals in Red Hat. If you sort of think that much like other software businesses, it's about a three-year cycle. If you go all the way back to 2020, which was a boom year, those are coming up in 2023. And so we believe that will give us 1 point or 2 point further tailwind behind the Q1 numbers. So as we sort of go through that, that gives us confidence based on the demand profile, the renewals as well as the uptick of the faster-growing areas like both OpenShift and likely Ansible coming down the road that we'll see numbers in that range. So with that sort of color on that, let me give it to Jim to add a lot more color on to both Red Hat and the other part on your pricing question.\nJames Kavanaugh : Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Toni for the question so we can get some clarity out here because I know this has been a hot topic of all of my discussion with investors over the first quarter, especially in light of the macroeconomic environment. First of all, as Arvind indicated, we're pretty pleased with the performance overall of our Red Hat portfolio. 11% growth here in the first quarter, off of, by the way, the toughest compare last year at 21% growth overall. And by the way, just to put this to rest, the operational growth compared to the GAAP growth is very similar in the first quarter. So the combination of deferred revenue, which, by the way, is de minimis, it's like in the single million dollars and the intercompany, to get a bridge from operational to GAAP is a rounding error in the first quarter. And by the way, we continue to expect that as we go forward. So the number that we report, and by the way, we're, what, four years into this acquisition now and we continue to talk about deferred revenue. But let's put that aside. Underneath the performance of 11%. Red Hat OpenShift's strong performance here in the quarter, growing north of 40%. We talked about 90 days ago, we put the number out there. Now that we've got to a $1 billion ARR business, we're seeing very good momentum in OpenShift as the leading hybrid cloud platform overall. And our Ansible portfolio, to Arvind's point, is scaling nicely and taking share on top of that. Now what's going to drive the growth in the second half of that 11%? We called the year now at 11% to 13%. I think being prudently cautious. We have a strong renewal available base that will start kicking in, in the second half. So I think that's really the core to the answer about the renewal base on the subscription. But just wrapping up Red Hat and the discussion I have with investors, taking a big step back, we're pleased overall. We're four years into this acquisition. We have quadrupled the Red Hat revenue from pre-acquisition in 3.5 years. And around the multiplier effect, we've accelerated our software portfolio, and we've accelerated our consulting portfolio to a high -- mid- to high single-digit growth business overall. So we're very pleased overall.\nPatricia Murphy: Thanks for that. Sheila, can we please go to the next question?\nOperator: Yes. Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\nWamsi Mohan : Arvind, you're now incorporating the possibility for slightly lower revenue growth, sounds like both around consulting, some areas like Red Hat and some of this is clearly macro. But at the same time, profitability is even more back-end loaded now. So what is giving you the confidence that these PTI improvements that you're targeting by segment, 100 bps in Consulting and 200 bps in Software is really going to come through in the second half of the year. And free cash flow guide remains unchanged despite sort of the revenue outlook having potential deterioration? Love to get some color on that.\nArvind Krishna : Sure, Wamsi. Look, I'll answer it in terms of what I'm seeing on the business, and I'll let Jim then put some precise numbers on it. We actually -- when we spoke to all of you in January, we were saying about 1/3 in the first half and 2/3 in the second half. Now we are saying actually a little bit more than 1/3 in the first half and the remaining in the second half. So actually, we are actually bringing it up a little bit despite taking on the restructuring charges and some of the Kyndryl associated charges that we're absorbing in those numbers. So what gives me confidence is when we look at the underlying performance in the first quarter, not all of our actions and productivity play out right in the quarter. But we are seeing enough green shoots in all of them to be able to predict those increases, of 1 point in consulting, the 2 points in software, et cetera, as you play through the year. And that allows us to have confidence in both the PTI and the cash flow despite the revenue numbers that we are projecting going forward. And I think actually, Q1 is a good down payment towards that, Wamsi. Despite the restructuring charge, we increased free cash flow by $100 million, and so that actually all goes together towards our numbers. Jim, anything you'd like to add to that?\nJames Kavanaugh : Yes. I would just say, I mean, you nailed it, Arvind. Wamsi, thank you very much for the question. Again, another important topic for our investors overall. The real two issues that are driving this distortion of seasonality of our profit and our cash, to Arvind's point, is currency and the workforce rebalancing charge. We said on the latter that it would pay back in the year, maybe a little bit more, but that is a big distortion of a $300 million-plus charge in the first half and a significant return in the second half. And by the way, that will benefit all of our segments. As you know, we fully allocate all of our indirect support costs to all of our segments so they'll get margin leverage off of that. But the only point I'd make on currency. Currency is a very different picture half to half. Revenue, neutral for the year, a headwind -- by the way, it was a bigger headwind in the first quarter. It was at the high end of 400 basis points. Second quarter, we say it's about 100 basis points headwind. That turns into a nice tailwind in the second half. And as we talked about many times in the past, currency impacts our business differently. Between our human capital-based consulting business, which, by the way, as you all understand, is a natural hedge because cost to source the same way as revenue. But our product-based businesses have a distortion in predominantly U.S. dollar cost and revenue in local currency. So when currency flips to a translation benefit in the second half, it has substantial margin leveragability coupled with that software growing at mid-single digit and a high-value annuitized TP world that carries very high marginal dollar profitability. So all else equal, currency and workforce rebalancing aside, it's a pretty typical year. And we, on top of that, have put out the $2 billion productivity number that we're going to continue aggressively going after.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Wamsi. Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffetNathanson.\nLisa Ellis : Wanted to ask about the impact of the recent banking mini crisis we've had over the last 6 weeks or so. What impact are you seeing on your business, given how much work IBM does with financial services firms? Like are you seeing any disruption? Or maybe on the flip side of that, any acceleration in demand for products and services, say, in like the risk management area?\nArvind Krishna : Lisa, great question. I'll begin by saying that what we have seen, which is so far mostly United States and a little bit in Europe, is going to be a second-order impact on us, not a first-order impact. Let me unpack that and say what I mean. The bulk of the uncertainty is around the smaller banks. They're being labeled regional banks but let me acknowledge some of these regional banks are really national banks. But that said, now as they get forced into tightening some of their lending standards, that is largely going to have an impact on SMB, small and medium business clients who are not our direct clients. Now let me acknowledge they are clients, though, of other larger companies who are our clients, but it gets muted as in the impact on us. When we're looking at our large banking clients, whether you think of the top 5 or 10 in the United States, you think of the top 20 in Europe, we are seeing pretty consistent demand right now because that is largely driven by payments, by retail accounts, by capital markets. And as you think about all of those, as long as you have reasonable employment and reasonable GDPs, we expect that, that demand is going to continue for our first-order clients. The second order will no doubt have a muted but it's a very tiny impact, and that is kind of what is baked into our current growth assumptions.\nPatricia Murphy: Let\u2019s go to the next question please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring : I guess, Arvind, maybe if you can just give us an update on how you're thinking about M&A, just given the broader macro environment, some of the comments you made about the consulting business, interest rates, your cash balance. If you could just bring it all together, maybe just provide an update today and if anything has changed relative to 90 days ago?\nArvind Krishna : Thanks, Erik. Great question. So I actually believe I'll begin by saying, I believe that as asset prices adjust, this could be quite an opportunistic time. Now is it going to be opportunistic in a month or in three months or in 12 months? I can't really predict. I'll be candid to say most of you probably determine that far more than we do. Now what are we doing to prepare and in what areas are we interested? If you notice, we carry a fair amount of cash on our balance sheet. As we have pointed out, we have a fair amount of FINFLEX at the IBM level. Even accounting for the dividend, because if you look at it over a 3-year period, that leaves circa $20 billion of total FINFLEX over 3 years. We're going to be judicious. We're going to wait for the right time. And it is going to be in the areas that we want. Those areas are going to be in our higher-value software and in areas where consulting can accelerate. We expect to remain 60%, maybe 75% of our total spend will be in software. The remaining will be in consulting. In Software, we're going to stick to our areas: hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence and data, cyber, automation, the areas we have talked about. So those are the areas, that is the amount we have, and we're going to wait for the appropriate time to leverage. But Erik, to answer, M&A is a very definite part of our model, and it is part of what is baked into both our mid- and long-term models for growth.\nPatricia Murphy: Thank you, Erik. Sheila, let\u2019s go to the next question.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Grossman with Stifel.\nDavid Grossman : Arvind, maybe you could talk a little bit more about the pricing dynamic in the marketplace and the pricing environment, given the shifting macro that we face. And perhaps you could help us better understand how to think of pricing and its impact on revenue growth this year and just prepare us for some of the potential outcomes and pricing and its impact on revenue growth next year?\nArvind Krishna : Okay. Thank you, David. Look, I'm going to break my answer up differently between the labor-based businesses and the technology businesses. In a labor-based business, we face the same inflation that the rest of the world is seeing. Our employees are expecting higher wages. As we hire new people, they get hired in at higher wages than their similar colleagues were a year ago. We have to get a return on that back from our clients. That said, if you take a 12- to 18-month period, all of that has to get baked in. Otherwise, that's not a healthy business. But if I take a 6- to 12-month period, there is a slight lag, which is why you get some but not all of that, and you can see that in the Consulting margins late last year. We expect that we'll begin to get some of that back. But if inflation remains at 10%, then you're kind of behind that but you get pricing power over the medium term there. If I go to our technology businesses, there is a gain. There is inflation in the goods that we purchase against those. And we invest very heavily in R&D and in technology, experienced people to help our clients. So there is, again, inflation in there. There is also inflation currency rates. But it's all in, it's packaged into what I'll use the word inflation. We expect that we will not get the full inflation. If I looked at the number this morning, the UK was saying 10%. You may not get 10% but we will get 4% or 5% or 6%. So over two or three years, you can feather that inflation back in, which is, again, required. Otherwise, we will not be able to invest in the innovation that our clients want. And that's how we should think about it, that we are willing to sort of feather it in so that our clients don't get a sticker shock right away. But over time, that is, I think, the nature of inflation, if I remember my college economics lessons.\nJames Kavanaugh : I would just add one thing. It goes without saying as Arvind continues to coach me, pricing optimization is always a direct reflection of the value that you have and the differentiation you have within your offering portfolio overall. So we talked about the consulting side. By the way, fourth consecutive quarter of nice improvement on price margins. You're seeing that play out in the gross margin up 90 basis points. But our software-based portfolio, where we do have differentiation overall, we talked about 90 days ago, right, we had some price optimization. You're seeing some of that play. And in the first quarter, probably about 1 point. For the full year, we think of our mid-single-digit model might be a couple of points. So somewhere in that ballpark, David.\nPatricia Murphy: Let\u2019s take one more question, Sheila. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies.\nKyle McNealy : I wonder if you could talk a little bit about your opportunity with AI, whether you're doing anything different with your business now versus the past few years. Do you have any new standalone AI products that you're launching that you could use to help reaccelerate in data and AI? I know that products go across the whole business, but some reacceleration in data and AI software products would be great. And what areas of the business do you see the most near-term opportunity, whether it's end-to-end applications or foundational models or infrastructure like the Vela cloud-native supercomputer you just announced?\nArvind Krishna : Kyle, great question. I'm not sure we have an hour so I'll try to my answer into 2 or 3 minutes. So we see a lot of opportunities. You used the word foundational models. So I think that, look, just for everybody else, AI has gone through sort of 4 generations very quickly from expert systems in the '80s and '90s, to machine learning, through about 2010, deep learning for the last decade and now this era of large language models and generative AI. We believe it has a tremendous application to the B2B side of AI inside enterprises. I kind of capture it as AI for business as opposed to AI for consumers. A lot of the excitement out there is on AI for consumers, and I think it's going to be a home run for those companies that are going down that path. But there's a lot of industries where people still worry about their data. They are careful about what's used to train the data. They cannot have an answer that occasionally inserts some friction into the answer. They need an answer that is from reliable sources only. Then the second part is a lot of these techniques, what people don't realize is it takes down the cost of deploying AI. What we are seeing is that a large language model can be trained and then do 100 tasks with very minor additional training. So yes, the first training is a lot more expensive, maybe 4, 5 times. But then if you can do 100 tasks for almost no additional cost, you can see that the overall is a 4 to 5x benefit in terms of time to value and productivity. So what are some examples? We did a preview of AI for ITOps around a product called Ansible. We're calling it Project Wisdom is our internal code name, but it shows that you can get 60% to 80% of the code that our IT operations person might write, gets written by the AI. Well, that's a 3x to 4x productivity for that individual. That's one example. Another example that we use, and you can see that play through in our customer care examples, which are multitudeness whether it's order-taking at McDonald's or CVS Health or Bradesco Bank, where we can now do 10 to 15 to 20 languages as in Spanish, French, English, German, for the cost of effectively 1 language from the past. So that shows through in the speed of deployment that we can do there. The areas that we are focused on to go drive all this is customer care, IT operations, digital labor and an example of that is what Jim talked about in our internal service centers and in cybersecurity. You'll see it come through sometimes directly, like I talked about in Wisdom, sometimes embedded with one of our software partners and sometimes as a piece of one of our products, be it our data lake products or our cybersecurity products, so in all those 3 flavors, consulting with clients, products from IBM and products with ISVs.\nArvind Krishna : So let me now wrap up the call. I hope what you took away from this discussion over the last hour is we feel very good and confident about our ability to meet client needs in this environment and our ability to deliver value to shareholders. I look forward to continuing the dialogue as we move through the year.\nPatricia Murphy: Sheila, I'll turn it over to you to wrap up the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us. Our first quarter results demonstrate that clients continue to turn to IBM to help them address today's business needs while positioning them for the future. We had a good start to the year with mid-single-digit revenue growth at constant currency, in line with our midterm model and growth in free cash flow. Performance was led by Software and Consulting as clients continue to accelerate their digital transformations, modernize their applications, automate their workflows, and create flexible and secure hybrid cloud environments. More recently, clients are prioritizing digital transformation projects that focus on cost takeout, productivity and quick returns. While demand for our offerings that support these priorities remains solid, we are seeing some deceleration in Consulting from the previous robust growth levels, especially in the United States. Globally, our clients continue to see technology as a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Technology helps them scale and enhance productivity, which is especially important in the face of inflation, demographic shift, cybersecurity, supply chain issues and sustainability goals. All of this supports our revenue growth expectations for the year. Our focus remains on revenue growth and free cash flow. 90 days ago, I shared that in 2023, we continue to unlock more productivity, expand our strategic partnerships and put more investment in specific growth markets. Productivity has always been an important part of our business model. It frees up spending and increases financial flexibility to enable investments. We have started to see some of this pay back in our results, which gives us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year free cash flow objectives. Let me spend a few minutes on the progress we have made in the execution of our strategy. Our focus is on hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence, the two most influential technologies for business. In tandem, these technologies drive both business outcomes and innovation. Hybrid cloud is now the most prominent form of IT architecture, and our approach is platform-centric. Red Hat OpenShift is the leading container platform, enabling clients to leverage the latest innovations in open source software. IBM's software and infrastructure have been tailored for this platform. Our consultants use their technical and business knowledge to speed up clients' digital transformation processes. In the first quarter, we co-created with more clients to unlock business value from a hybrid cloud approach. We are working with Virgin Money to migrate their credit card service to the IBM Cloud for Financial Services. They will also leverage IBM's consulting capabilities to create new digital customer experiences. For the Boston Red Sox, we are collaborating with Wasabi Technologies, leveraging hybrid cloud technologies to analyse key data sources that improve the club's operations. The second element of our strategy is top of mind for a lot of clients, artificial intelligence. AI is projected to add $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030. Keep in mind that AI for business is different than AI for consumers, given their need for more accurate results, trusted data and governance tools. AI techniques such as foundation models, large language models and generative AI, give businesses the ability to create 100 AI models from a single data set. Early client engagements experienced a 70% faster time to value. That is why we are seeing a lot more interest from business and using AI to boost productivity and reduce costs. Productivity gains will come from enterprises turning their workflows into simpler automated processes with AI. To achieve this, we are collaborating with companies like Citi to enhance their internal audit and compliance processes through AI. J.B. Hunt Transport use our Turbonomic AI-powered resourcing and automation engine to optimize their cloud environment. This helped reduce infrastructure refresh costs by 75%. This is a great example of the work we're doing in IT operations. In other areas such as customer care, we are automating hundreds of thousands of call center responses with AI with more than 90% accuracy and greater levels of customer satisfaction. In cybersecurity, our elite defense teams are deploying AI to defend against criminals in real time. In digital labor, we are helping finance, accounting and HR teams save thousands of hours by automating what used to be labor-intensive data entry tasks. To bring our hybrid cloud and AI strategy to market, our partner ecosystem continues to play a critical role. We expanded our partnership with Adobe to help marketing and creative organizations make the production of content easier. IBM and EY announced a collaboration using IBM software and EY's sustainability consulting practice to help companies operationalize decarbonization action plans. Juniper Networks and Nokia also recently expanded their collaboration around IBM's network intelligence and automation solutions to monetize and optimize investments in networks more effectively. We remain focused on delivering new innovations that matter to our clients. A good example of this is the Cleveland Clinic-IBM Discovery Accelerator where multiple projects are underway that leverage the latest in quantum computing, artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud to help expedite discoveries in biomedical research. At the Cleveland Clinic, we also recently unveiled the first quantum computer dedicated to health care research. To complement our own innovations, in the first quarter, we acquired 3 companies that extend our capabilities in hybrid cloud and AI. We also continue to engage in projects that have a positive impact on society. Many clients are leveraging our technology and expertise to advance their sustainability agendas. For example, in the area of manufacturing, Siemens and IBM are announcing a new software solution that integrates software from both companies to enable sustainable product development. Sustainability is a focus area for all businesses. And just last week, we released our annual report on IBM's efforts in this area, IBM Impact. I'd encourage you to read about our progress in areas ranging from energy savings and carbon emissions reduction to skills development and increasing diversity. I'll conclude by saying that we are confident in the changes we have made to our business over the last three years, aligning our strategy, priorities and portfolio to the needs of our clients. This work, together with our continued focus on productivity, are enabling us to deliver sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth.  I'll now hand it over to Jim who will offer more insight into our performance and expectations. Shannon, thank you for the question. And as you can imagine, we spend a lot of time both digesting and making our own estimates based on what our clients are saying. So you said geography, verticals and then within technology segments, so let me try to unpack it a little. So on a geography level, a lot of the uncertainty that is in the media here, certainly in North America is not there in Asia at all. If I look across Japan, India, the Middle East, which kind of covers the broad swath of Asia, with the exception of China, we don't see any of that playing out. The geopolitics around China is a slightly different piece but I think everyone is subject to that right now. Then if I come to Europe, it's actually been stronger than I would have predicted six months ago, but that is because of my point on technology as a deflationary force. When we look at the mixture of interest rates, inflation, wage inflation, demographic, meaning labor shortages, supply chain resiliency, cyber, technology is actually the only answer companies have against all that. Now that does apply to the larger enterprises who are our primary customers. When I come to the United States, we did see some slowing down in consulting projects, as I said. But that is because consulting is somewhat discretionary. However, we are not seeing people cancel projects. What they are doing is slowing them down, meaning pushing to the right, which is why we took the numbers down for consulting, believing that, that may spread in some sense to other parts of the globe as well. Software, we are seeing demand remain very steady. We're not seeing any signs of weakness in software. Admittedly, we are in B2B software. We are not in any B2C segment. And in infrastructure, I think it's less of a macro. It's much more, in our case, a product cycle issue that is playing through. I hope that gave you some color on why we have confidence in the demand, weakness in 1 particular area, which we think will likely play through. But I want to caution that weakness is not us shrinking. It just says that double-digit rates went down into the 6% to 8%, which is still healthy. So Amit, let me just take the first part of your question on the linkage between consulting and software, and then I'll hand it to Jim for other parts of the question. So I think that if I look at the consulting, it's not going to spread to software in our belief. Remember, our consulting is comprised if you just want to break it down into sort of three parts. We work with a lot of other partners including on the public clouds, including with large software providers, and we tend to do these projects for our clients. I keep cautioning, it's slowing down but still in the 6% to 8%, not in a rate lower than that. Yes, there is a linkage to software but a lot of our software is running critical systems for our clients, and we don't see those very subject to what we see in the current macroeconomic environment. And so that's what gives us confidence on those. Also, I think the movement towards hybrid cloud and the ability to take advantage of AI for enterprise productivity is perhaps going to be a tailwind as we enter the second half of the year because I do think that clients are going to do a lot of automation and a lot of cost cutting, which will likely benefit elements of our software portfolio. Jim? So great questions. So let me start, and then I'm going to give it to Jim for a lot more detail. So first of all, on Red Hat, as I think Jim answered in one of the prior questions and in some of the prepared remarks as well, we are now expecting 11% to 13% for the year. That's kind of where we expect Red Hat to be. And that's an all-in number for the year that's inclusive of Q1. So Q1 was at the bottom end of that range. We are seeing more demand coming up as we go through the year. We know our cycles of renewals in Red Hat. If you sort of think that much like other software businesses, it's about a three-year cycle. If you go all the way back to 2020, which was a boom year, those are coming up in 2023. And so we believe that will give us 1 point or 2 point further tailwind behind the Q1 numbers. So as we sort of go through that, that gives us confidence based on the demand profile, the renewals as well as the uptick of the faster-growing areas like both OpenShift and likely Ansible coming down the road that we'll see numbers in that range. So with that sort of color on that, let me give it to Jim to add a lot more color on to both Red Hat and the other part on your pricing question. Sure, Wamsi. Look, I'll answer it in terms of what I'm seeing on the business, and I'll let Jim then put some precise numbers on it. We actually -- when we spoke to all of you in January, we were saying about 1/3 in the first half and 2/3 in the second half. Now we are saying actually a little bit more than 1/3 in the first half and the remaining in the second half. So actually, we are actually bringing it up a little bit despite taking on the restructuring charges and some of the Kyndryl associated charges that we're absorbing in those numbers. So what gives me confidence is when we look at the underlying performance in the first quarter, not all of our actions and productivity play out right in the quarter. But we are seeing enough green shoots in all of them to be able to predict those increases, of 1 point in consulting, the 2 points in software, et cetera, as you play through the year. And that allows us to have confidence in both the PTI and the cash flow despite the revenue numbers that we are projecting going forward. And I think actually, Q1 is a good down payment towards that, Wamsi. Despite the restructuring charge, we increased free cash flow by $100 million, and so that actually all goes together towards our numbers. Jim, anything you'd like to add to that? Lisa, great question. I'll begin by saying that what we have seen, which is so far mostly United States and a little bit in Europe, is going to be a second-order impact on us, not a first-order impact. Let me unpack that and say what I mean. The bulk of the uncertainty is around the smaller banks. They're being labeled regional banks but let me acknowledge some of these regional banks are really national banks. But that said, now as they get forced into tightening some of their lending standards, that is largely going to have an impact on SMB, small and medium business clients who are not our direct clients. Now let me acknowledge they are clients, though, of other larger companies who are our clients, but it gets muted as in the impact on us. When we're looking at our large banking clients, whether you think of the top 5 or 10 in the United States, you think of the top 20 in Europe, we are seeing pretty consistent demand right now because that is largely driven by payments, by retail accounts, by capital markets. And as you think about all of those, as long as you have reasonable employment and reasonable GDPs, we expect that, that demand is going to continue for our first-order clients. The second order will no doubt have a muted but it's a very tiny impact, and that is kind of what is baked into our current growth assumptions. Thanks, Erik. Great question. So I actually believe I'll begin by saying, I believe that as asset prices adjust, this could be quite an opportunistic time. Now is it going to be opportunistic in a month or in three months or in 12 months? I can't really predict. I'll be candid to say most of you probably determine that far more than we do. Now what are we doing to prepare and in what areas are we interested? If you notice, we carry a fair amount of cash on our balance sheet. As we have pointed out, we have a fair amount of FINFLEX at the IBM level. Even accounting for the dividend, because if you look at it over a 3-year period, that leaves circa $20 billion of total FINFLEX over 3 years. We're going to be judicious. We're going to wait for the right time. And it is going to be in the areas that we want. Those areas are going to be in our higher-value software and in areas where consulting can accelerate. We expect to remain 60%, maybe 75% of our total spend will be in software. The remaining will be in consulting. In Software, we're going to stick to our areas: hybrid cloud, artificial intelligence and data, cyber, automation, the areas we have talked about. So those are the areas, that is the amount we have, and we're going to wait for the appropriate time to leverage. But Erik, to answer, M&A is a very definite part of our model, and it is part of what is baked into both our mid- and long-term models for growth. Okay. Thank you, David. Look, I'm going to break my answer up differently between the labor-based businesses and the technology businesses. In a labor-based business, we face the same inflation that the rest of the world is seeing. Our employees are expecting higher wages. As we hire new people, they get hired in at higher wages than their similar colleagues were a year ago. We have to get a return on that back from our clients. That said, if you take a 12- to 18-month period, all of that has to get baked in. Otherwise, that's not a healthy business. But if I take a 6- to 12-month period, there is a slight lag, which is why you get some but not all of that, and you can see that in the Consulting margins late last year.

You may not get 10% but we will get 4% or 5% or 6%. So over two or three years, you can feather that inflation back in, which is, again, required. Otherwise, we will not be able to invest in the innovation that our clients want. And that's how we should think about it, that we are willing to sort of feather it in so that our clients don't get a sticker shock right away. But over time, that is, I think, the nature of inflation, if I remember my college economics lessons. Kyle, great question. I'm not sure we have an hour so I'll try to my answer into 2 or 3 minutes. So we see a lot of opportunities. You used the word foundational models. So I think that, look, just for everybody else, AI has gone through sort of 4 generations very quickly from expert systems in the '80s and '90s, to machine learning, through about 2010, deep learning for the last decade and now this era of large language models and generative AI.

            "name": "James Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. I'll start with the financial highlights of the first quarter. We delivered $14.3 billion in revenue, $1.4 billion of operating pre-tax income, $1.36 of operating earnings per share and $1.3 billion of free cash flow. Our revenue for the quarter was up about 4.5% at constant currency. That includes over 1 point of impact from the businesses we divested. Currency rates impacted our reported revenue growth by 4 points. That is over $100 million more than spot rates would have suggested 90 days ago. As always, I'll focus my comments on constant currency. Revenue growth this quarter was led by Software and Consulting. Software revenue was up nearly 6% and Consulting up 8%. These are our growth vectors and now represent about three-quarters of our annual revenue. Our infrastructure revenue was flat with continued strength in z Systems. All three of our geographies grew, with high single-digit growth in both EMEA and Asia Pacific. Across our business, more than half of IBM's revenue is recurring, led by high-value software which is growing at mid-single-digit rate. Looking at our profit metrics for the quarter. Operating gross margin expanded 80 basis points. We expanded gross margin in all segments with a strong portfolio mix overall. Operating pre-tax income, excluding the impact of workforce rebalancing, was up 12%, and margin expanded 130 basis points. You'll recall back in January, I mentioned we were planning to address remaining stranded costs from our portfolio actions and we anticipated a charge of about $300 million. As we executed our plan, we took a charge of $260 million in the first quarter, and we expect to complete this action in the second quarter. This workforce rebalancing charge primarily addresses indirect support function. We are no longer including workforce rebalancing charges in our measure of segment profit to provide a view of our segment results consistent with our ongoing operational profile. At the IBM level, including the workforce rebalancing activity, operating pre-tax income was down 4%, and margin was down 50 basis points. Within our margin performance, we absorbed a significant currency headwind. The combination of translation and hedging impacted operating pre-tax profit growth by about $160 million and operating PTI margin by 70 basis points year-to-year. As I've discussed in the past, this essentially impacts our product-based businesses. Mitigating that, the change in useful lives of our server and networking equipment provides a 50 basis point year-to-year benefit to operating PTI margin, which is included primarily in our infrastructure segment. Taking it back up a level, IBM's profit performance this quarter benefits from improvements in business mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. We've been digitally transforming IBM, much in the same way we're helping our clients with their transformation, using both IBM and third-party capabilities. Think of IBM as client zero. We are driving G&A efficiencies by reimagining and transforming the way we work. This includes optimizing our infrastructure and application environments as well as redesigning our end-to-end business processes. Let me give you a few examples. Across IBM's IT environment, we're realizing the value of hybrid cloud. We reduced the average cost of running an application by 90% by moving from a legacy data center environment to a hybrid cloud environment running on Red Hat OpenShift. We've been simplifying our application environment. By standardizing global processes and applying AIOps, we are reducing our application portfolio by more than 35%. We've automated over 24 million transactions with RPA, avoiding hundreds of thousands of manual tasks and eliminating the risk of human error, and we're deploying AI at scale to reengineer our business processes. We're doing that in areas like HR and talent, finance and end-to-end processes like quote to cash and Source to Pay. For example, in HR, we now handle 94% of our company-wide HR inquiries with our AskHR digital system, speeding up the completion of many HR tasks by up to 75%. These productivity initiatives free up spending for reinvestment and contribute to margin expansion. Turning to free cash flow. We generated $1.3 billion in the quarter. This is up $100 million year-to-year and puts us on track to our full year expectation. Growth is driven by our profit performance and working capital efficiencies as well as lower payments for structural action. This was mitigated by an increase in capital expenditures and higher performance-based compensation payments, given last year's strong results. In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash over $17 billion, which is up nearly $9 billion from December. We have been opportunistic in accessing the debt market and issued debt early in the year to prudently get ahead of 2023 and 2024 maturities. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was over $58 billion, up nearly $8 billion from year-end. Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew nearly 6%, in line with software's mid-single-digit model. We had growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and transaction processing. This performance captures the benefits of our growing recurring revenue stream, which is about 80% of annual software revenue with continued strong renewal rates. This, together with growth in software transactions this quarter demonstrates clients' commitment to our hybrid cloud and AI platforms. In Hybrid Platform & Solutions, revenue was up 5%, fueled by growth across all business areas. We continue to see client demand for broad capabilities across Red Hat, automation, data in AI and security. Red Hat revenue grew 11% with growth across all major offerings. We have particular strength in our hybrid cloud platform, OpenShift; and Ansible, our IT automation solution. Both offerings also continue to take market share this quarter. Automation revenue was up 2%, driven by integration and application servers, given client demand for improved IT performance and costs. In data and AI, revenue grew 3%, reflecting growth across data management, business analytics and asset and supply chain management. Many of these offerings, like Db2, serve as the underpinnings for modern AI and mission-critical workloads. Security revenue was up 2% with growth across security for hybrid cloud, which includes both identity and threat management and security for data. Bringing this all together, our Hybrid Platform & Solutions ARR is now at $13.5 billion. In transaction processing, revenue grew 6.5%. The software remains core to our clients' hybrid cloud strategies. The strong performance over the last couple of system cycles drove significant capacity growth. In fact, installed MIPS growth during our z15 cycle was 2x that of z14. This translates to software opportunity and contributed to growth in both recurring and transactional revenue. Layering in this year's price increases, we delivered good performance in Transaction Processing this quarter. Moving to profit for the Software segment. Gross margin was up and pre-tax margin was flat this quarter with the latter absorbing nearly 1 point of impact from currency. Consulting revenue was up 8% and I'll remind you, we had a strong growth in the first quarter of last year. Our book-to-bill ratio over the last 12 months was 1.07. Signings in the quarter grew 7% with similar performance across both larger and smaller engagements. We continue to see broad demand for projects that deliver technology-driven transformation, leveraging a hybrid cloud environment. Within the quarter, demand was solid for cloud modernization offerings, and we had one of our largest Red Hat signings quarters ever. More recently, clients are particularly focused on driving productivity and cost reductions with greater agility and faster time to value. This is contributing to signings growth from digital transformations in areas such as talent, finance and supply chain transformation. In terms of revenue, while we had solid growth overall, we have seen some clients in the U.S. pull back on more discretionary projects, impacting backlog realization within the quarter. Bringing it back up to the global level, Business Transformation grew 6%, Technology Consulting grew 4% and Application Operations grew 13%. Revenue growth was led by data and customer experience transformation project, in addition to cloud application development and management. Our hybrid cloud expertise and depth and breadth of strategic partnerships differentiate IBM Consulting in today's market. Red Hat consulting revenue, now over $2 billion annually, continue to grow at a double-digit rate. And our strategic partnerships continued strong growth, making up over 35% of our revenue in this segment over the last 12 months. Moving to consulting profit, we expanded both gross and pre-tax margins. Our pre-tax margin of about 8% in the quarter was up 50 basis points year-to-year as we continue to benefit from the productivity actions we've taken. Turning to the Infrastructure segment, revenue was flat. Hybrid Infrastructure revenue was up 4% and Infrastructure Support revenue was down 4%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, z Systems revenue was up 11%. This was a fourth quarter of z16 availability, and the solid program performance has outpaced that of prior cycles. In addition to capabilities around embedded AI at scale, cloud-native development for hybrid cloud and cyber resilience security, clients are also leveraging z16 for its energy efficiency. For example, consolidating Linux workloads on a single z16 system can reduce energy consumption by up to 75%. We continue to see strong growth in shipped MIPS for new Linux workloads on z16. Distributed infrastructure revenue was flat. Growth in storage was offset by declines in power as we have wrapped on the launch of the Power10 high-end systems.  Moving to infrastructure profit. We expanded both gross and pre-tax margins. The 80 basis point improvement in pre-tax margin reflects benefits from both the z Systems' product cycle and changes in useful life, partially offset by nearly 2 points of currency impact. Now let me bring it back up to the IBM level to wrap it up. When we first introduced today's IBM back in October of 2021, we provided a midterm model for revenue growth, margin expansion and free cash flow growth. We delivered on that model throughout last year and now have a good start to 2023. In the first quarter, we delivered constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, expanded gross margin, drove productivity in our underlying business and grew our free cash flow. Looking at full year 2023, as always, I'll start with our two primary metrics: revenue growth and free cash flow. On the top line, we expect constant currency revenue growth of 3% to 5%. And we continue to expect free cash flow of about $10.5 billion, which is up over $1 billion year-to-year. Inherent in our midterm model is margin expansion, driven by improving business mix, efficiency initiatives and productivity enhancement. Driving efficiency and productivity has always been a part of our operating and financial models. I mentioned some of the initiatives we have underway and we continue to evaluate additional actions. Altogether, the current initiatives are expected to deliver $2 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024. These initiatives provide additional flexibility, enabling reinvestment in the business to support future growth, contributing to margin expansion and increasing financial flexibility. Let me spend a minute on our expectations for constant currency revenue and pretax profit performance by segment. In Software, we continue to expect revenue growth in line with software's mid-single-digit model. This revenue growth drives operating leverage, and we still expect software pre-tax margin to expand by about 2 points year-to-year. In Consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations and application modernization. So as I said, we are seeing some pressure on more discretionary projects in the United States. We now see Consulting revenue growth in the range of 6% to 8% and continue to expect to expand Consulting pre-tax margin by at least 1 point as we capitalize on the yield of our productivity actions. Infrastructure revenue is roughly flat over the midterm model horizon, with performance in any year reflecting product cycle dynamics. We're about to wrap on the z16 introduction. As a result, we expect 2023 infrastructure revenue to decline with pre-tax margin in the low teens. To provide some perspective, Infrastructure should impact IBM's overall revenue growth by over 1 point. With these segment dynamics, we would expect IBM's operating pre-tax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year. That's in line with our model. And we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the mid- to high teens range. As I mentioned earlier, the dollar has strengthened over the last 90 days. We now expect currency translation to be fairly neutral to our revenue growth for the year, which is about 0.5 point worse than 90 days ago. I'll remind you that our profit and cash dynamics this year are impacted by the unwinding of last year's hedging gain, which is about 1 point of headwind to our pre-tax margin expansion. Looking at the second quarter, we expect first to second quarter revenue seasonality to be fairly consistent with last year. That's up about $1.3 billion, though the underlying dynamics are different due primarily to z Systems' product cycle and currency. I'll remind you, we had a successful launch of our z16 in the second quarter of last year, and that creates a year-to-year headwind to growth of about 3 points. In terms of profit, we now expect a little over 1/3 of our operating net income in the first half and just under 2/3 in the second half. This reflects a first half headwind from currency and workforce rebalancing dynamics, both of which flip to a tailwind in the second half. I mentioned the workforce rebalancing activity we have underway. Between the first and second quarter, the charge should be in the range of $300 million, maybe a little more. We still expect this action to pay back by the end of the year. In closing, we entered the year as a more focused business with solid fundamentals. We had a good start to 2023 and are positioned to deliver revenue growth, expand margins and grow free cash flow for the year. I'm happy to provide more color on the quarter and our expectations in the Q&A. Patricia, let's get started. Yes. So Amit, thank you very much for the question. I mean, as building on what Arvind just said, we are very pleased overall with our start to the year with regards to software here in the first quarter, nearly 6% growth at the high end of our model overall. By the way, the fundamentals of that business doing extremely well, growing gross margins 60 basis points, growing pre-tax income. But software is an integral part of not only our hybrid cloud platform thesis but also an integral part of that economic multiplier equation. $25 billion of revenue, over 40% of IBM's revenue composition, over 2/3 of IBM's profit, solid ARR $13.5 billion, growing 7% and a flywheel effect of NRR going well north of 100%. And I think linking back to Shannon's question and part of your question, Arvind's been very clear that we believe that technology is a source of competitive advantage for every industry and every client now, and we built out a portfolio to go capitalize on that. Now let's take a step back because you asked a question about revenue contribution and then the mix of Hybrid Platform & Solution versus transactional. Let's talk first about the revenue contribution. Going back 90 days ago, we laid out the year. We said we were confident in our software portfolio, growing on model. We started off the first quarter with putting a dot on the board and contributing to that level actually near the high end. But we said entering the year that we've got about 80% of our portfolio is high-value recurring revenue, annuitized revenue. And we thought that, that is going to contribute a little over 5 points of that midterm model growth -- mid-single-digit model growth. And underneath that 5 points, about half of it is going to come out of Red Hat, by the way, growing 11% to 13% for the year, and about half of that out of our recurring revenue stream from IBM, capitalizing on a very strong installed MIPS capacity and renewal rates, along with some price optimization. And by the way, first quarter played out that way.  Now Transaction, the remaining 20%, we said we definitely acknowledge we're heading into the down cycle on ELAs. And by the way, ELAs don't go up 100% one year and down. Over a three-year period, you typically get 60% in the first year and then it whittles down over the next couple of years. And we said we expect about a zero to 1-point headwind. And in the first quarter, we actually did quite well. The transactional volume actually contributed over 1 point of Software's growth. So that's kind of a build-up of the contribution between our two businesses. Now around the lines of business, Hybrid Platform & Solution, our model is anywhere from mid- to high single digit. We delivered 5% in the first quarter. And what we see for the full year is right along that model. Red Hat improving, given the performance of a renewal cycle. We've got an ARR at $13.5 billion, growing 7%. And by the way, that's a leading indicator, which is positive for us. Our Cloud Pak growth continues to be very strong, and we got new innovation that we continue to bring to market. And then Transaction Processing, very pleased overall first quarter, 6.5% growth. We believe full year is going to be somewhere in the low to mid-single digit. And again, that is capitalizing on that 2x growth in installed MIPS and those strong renewal and price. So that kind of hopefully sums up the software portfolio for your question. Yes. Thanks, Arvind, and thanks, Toni for the question so we can get some clarity out here because I know this has been a hot topic of all of my discussion with investors over the first quarter, especially in light of the macroeconomic environment. First of all, as Arvind indicated, we're pretty pleased with the performance overall of our Red Hat portfolio. 11% growth here in the first quarter, off of, by the way, the toughest compare last year at 21% growth overall. And by the way, just to put this to rest, the operational growth compared to the GAAP growth is very similar in the first quarter. So the combination of deferred revenue, which, by the way, is de minimis, it's like in the single million dollars and the intercompany, to get a bridge from operational to GAAP is a rounding error in the first quarter. And by the way, we continue to expect that as we go forward. So the number that we report, and by the way, we're, what, four years into this acquisition now and we continue to talk about deferred revenue. But let's put that aside. Underneath the performance of 11%. Red Hat OpenShift's strong performance here in the quarter, growing north of 40%. We talked about 90 days ago, we put the number out there. Now that we've got to a $1 billion ARR business, we're seeing very good momentum in OpenShift as the leading hybrid cloud platform overall. And our Ansible portfolio, to Arvind's point, is scaling nicely and taking share on top of that. Now what's going to drive the growth in the second half of that 11%? We called the year now at 11% to 13%. I think being prudently cautious. We have a strong renewal available base that will start kicking in, in the second half. So I think that's really the core to the answer about the renewal base on the subscription. But just wrapping up Red Hat and the discussion I have with investors, taking a big step back, we're pleased overall. We're four years into this acquisition. We have quadrupled the Red Hat revenue from pre-acquisition in 3.5 years. And around the multiplier effect, we've accelerated our software portfolio, and we've accelerated our consulting portfolio to a high -- mid- to high single-digit growth business overall. So we're very pleased overall. Yes. I would just say, I mean, you nailed it, Arvind. Wamsi, thank you very much for the question. Again, another important topic for our investors overall. The real two issues that are driving this distortion of seasonality of our profit and our cash, to Arvind's point, is currency and the workforce rebalancing charge. We said on the latter that it would pay back in the year, maybe a little bit more, but that is a big distortion of a $300 million-plus charge in the first half and a significant return in the second half. And by the way, that will benefit all of our segments. As you know, we fully allocate all of our indirect support costs to all of our segments so they'll get margin leverage off of that. But the only point I'd make on currency. Currency is a very different picture half to half. Revenue, neutral for the year, a headwind -- by the way, it was a bigger headwind in the first quarter. It was at the high end of 400 basis points. Second quarter, we say it's about 100 basis points headwind. That turns into a nice tailwind in the second half. And as we talked about many times in the past, currency impacts our business differently. Between our human capital-based consulting business, which, by the way, as you all understand, is a natural hedge because cost to source the same way as revenue. But our product-based businesses have a distortion in predominantly U.S. dollar cost and revenue in local currency. So when currency flips to a translation benefit in the second half, it has substantial margin leveragability coupled with that software growing at mid-single digit and a high-value annuitized TP world that carries very high marginal dollar profitability. So all else equal, currency and workforce rebalancing aside, it's a pretty typical year. And we, on top of that, have put out the $2 billion productivity number that we're going to continue aggressively going after. I would just add one thing. It goes without saying as Arvind continues to coach me, pricing optimization is always a direct reflection of the value that you have and the differentiation you have within your offering portfolio overall. So we talked about the consulting side. By the way, fourth consecutive quarter of nice improvement on price margins. You're seeing that play out in the gross margin up 90 basis points. But our software-based portfolio, where we do have differentiation overall, we talked about 90 days ago, right, we had some price optimization. You're seeing some of that play. And in the first quarter, probably about 1 point. For the full year, we think of our mid-single-digit model might be a couple of points. So somewhere in that ballpark, David."

So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\nArvind Krishna: Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by discussing the quarter before I get into more detail on the execution of our strategy. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in software with the reacceleration in Red Hat and continued strength in transaction processing. Infrastructure reflects product cycle dynamics with z16 well ahead of prior cycles, highlighting customer adoption and continued reliance on the mainframe. In consulting, we continue to navigate an uncertain macro environment with results at the lower end of our expectations. We generated strong operating profitability and the highest levels of first-nine months cash generation in many years, while overall revenue performance was mixed. We continue to reposition our portfolio towards a higher growth, higher margin business that is well positioned to address client needs around hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. I'll start with a few thoughts on the macroeconomic environment. Technology spending remains strong. Businesses view technology as a source of competitive advantage allowing them to scale operations, improve productivity and drive growth. However, a pause in discretionary spending is impacting our consulting business. This is due to economic uncertainty which stems from several temporary factors, including geopolitical issues, upcoming elections and the changing landscape of interest rates and inflation levels. The consulting market remains dynamic with significant opportunity as clients prepare for AI. Overall, we are confident in our business and our ability to capture these opportunities. Now turning to our performance. Software is nearly 45% of our total revenue, up from the high-20s in 2018, a testament to our focus on organic innovation and repositioning our portfolio. You can see this in our quarterly results as we delivered strong and accelerating software revenue growth of 10%, including Red Hat at 14%, 7 points of organic growth and strength across our key platforms. Software segment profit margin was about 30%. Our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue, continues to deliver strong growth. ARR for hybrid platform and solutions now stands at $14.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year. This quarter marks the five year anniversary of our acquisition of Red Hat and I am proud of our accomplishments together. Since IBM announced the acquisition, Red Hat revenue has grown to approximately $6.5 billion, doubling in size and delivering a mid-teens CAGR. OpenShift scaled from about $100 million in ARR to $1.3 billion, expanding more than 10 times. Red Hat has also continued to diversify its global footprint expanding into many new countries since acquisition. We continue to drive innovation, announcing new capabilities, including Ansible 2.5, RHEL.ai and OpenShift AI. Red Hat was also named a leader for the second consecutive year in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management. We continue to gain traction in enterprise AI. Our book of business related to generative AI is now over $3 billion inception to date, up more than $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. The mix is roughly one-fifth software and four-fifth consulting signings. This performance has placed us in an early leadership position, which is crucial at the onset of any technology shift. The AI portfolio we have built is designed to give clients a comprehensive set of tools to deploy AI within their enterprise. RHEL.ai and OpenShift AI allow clients to build a consistent AI foundation based on open source technology, while watsonx provides an AI middleware platform. Our assistants are designed to help clients become more productive using AI across a variety of business processes from code to HR, customer service and more. Consulting is helping clients design and execute AI strategies. We also continue to see our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients bring AI to their data. Choosing the right AI model is top of mind for our clients. IBM's Granite family of AI models are fit for purpose. Earlier this year, we released code models with 8 billion to 34 billion parameters. This month, we updated Granite models, making them approximately 90% more cost efficient than larger models. These models can be trained in weeks instead of months and are easier to fine-tune for specific tasks. Granite models are available on watsonx and Red Hat and are also integrated into offerings from partners like AWS, Salesforce, Qualcomm and SAP. Globally, clients are turning to IBM to transform their operations with technology. This quarter, we announced new collaborations with NatWest, Telefonica, Samsung SDS, Toyota Systems and many others. At the U.S. Open, IBM delivered AI-generated match report summaries and we are collaborating with ESPN to enhance the sports coverage through advanced AI insights. We also continue to deepen our relationships with key technology partners, including Dell, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow. We remain focused on delivering innovations to the market. For example, this quarter, we announced Telum II, IBM's next-generation processor for Z and the Spyre Accelerator, which will significantly enhance IBM Z's AI capabilities and processing power for enterprise scale applications. Investment in emerging technologies also remains a focus for IBM. Earlier this month, we opened Europe's first IBM Quantum Data Center. This is the second IBM Quantum data center deployed globally, which will greatly advance our goal of expanding access to the world's most performant quantum computers. Before I conclude, let me touch on our outlook. The momentum in our software strategy can be seen in our year-to-date results. Our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter reflects this progress, balanced by macro dynamics in Consulting and Infrastructure product cycle dynamics. We remain confident in our free cash flow guidance which we raised in July, driven by continued strength in our operating margin performance. Overall, our portfolio is well positioned to deliver an upward inflection in growth in 2025. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us and will share more details with you in January. I will now hand over to Jim to walk you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you.\nJames Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. In the third quarter, we delivered $15 billion in revenue, $3.8 billion of adjusted EBITDA, $2.5 billion of operating pretax income, and $2.30 operating diluted earnings per share. And through the first-nine months, we generated $6.6 billion of free cash flow. We are pleased with the solid operating profitability and free cash flow generation of the business. Revenue growth, combined with 100 basis points of operating pretax margin expansion drove 8% operating pretax profit growth, and 5% operating diluted earnings per share growth. Our revenue growth for the quarter was up 2% at constant currency. Software growth accelerated to 10%, with strength across our key platforms of Red Hat, automation, data and AI and transaction processing. Consulting was flat and continue to be impacted by a dynamic market environment as clients reprioritized spending and infrastructure was down 7%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Our portfolio mix, operating leverage and yield from productivity initiatives generated strong gross margin, operating profit and free cash flow performance. These results represent our highest third quarter levels of gross margin and free cash flow in many years. We expanded operating gross margin by 210 basis points and operating pretax margin by 100 basis points over last year. Year-to-date, operating pretax margin is up 150 basis points, well ahead of our guidance provided in July of over 50 basis points of improvement in 2024. In September, we closed on the Palo Alto QRadar transaction, generating a pretax gain of about $350 million in the quarter. As we previously discussed, this was substantially offset by the charges we took to address stranded costs and accelerate our productivity initiatives. These productivity initiatives allowed for continued investment to drive innovation, which you can see in our higher R&D expense up 10% year-to-date. Year-to-date, we generated $6.6 billion of free cash flow, up $1.5 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this year-to-date growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up about $800 million year-over-year. This quarter, we realized $500 million in proceeds from the Palo Alto QRadar transaction. As I mentioned last quarter, for the full year, we expect only a modest contribution of free cash flow given payouts from structural actions we have taken and foregone profit from the QRadar business. Through the first-nine months of the year, excluding the impact of the QRadar transaction, we are several points ahead of our two year average attainment levels. In terms of cash uses, year-to-date we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a strong liquidity position with cash of about $14 billion. Our debt balance at the end of the third quarter was flat with year-end 2023 at $56.6 billion, including $10.4 billion from our financing business. Turning to the segments. Software revenue growth accelerated to 10%, with broad-based growth across the portfolio. This reflects the repositioning of software around key growth platforms: Hybrid cloud, automation, data and transaction processing, where we deliver a differentiated value proposition to address clients' most pressing needs. Growth this quarter was fueled by the same performance drivers we've highlighted throughout the year. Red Hat accelerated, contributing about 3.5 points of growth to software. The combination of innovation and recurring revenue contributed about 3.5 points to growth. And our focused M&A strategy contributed about 3 points of growth. Let me take you through some more details on each of these. Red Hat revenue growth accelerated to 14%, up 6 points sequentially. We gained market share across each of our key solutions, with OpenShift and Ansible growing more than 20% and RHEL growing in the double-digits. This strength reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions as clients continue to prioritize application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spend and reduce operational complexity. We saw strong acceleration in Red Hat's subscription business, while the consumption-based services business stabilized as we expected. Looking at our revenue under contract over the next six months, this metric continues to grow in the mid-teens as our annual bookings grew double-digits in the third quarter. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us, including generative AI, early client interest in our virtualization solution and after the deal completion, potential synergies with HashiCorp. We delivered strong growth in our recurring revenue base and are seeing momentum from innovation across our software portfolio. Hybrid platform and solutions ARR was $14.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by strength across automation, data and AI and Red Hat. Transaction processing grew 9% in the quarter, growing capacity, solid renewal rates and continued customer interest in our new generative AI product, watsonx Code Assistant for Z contributed to growth. We continue to invest in bringing innovation to market, launching new offerings like RHEL.ai, Ansible 2.5 and updated capabilities to our family of assistance including the recently announced watsonx Code Assistant with advanced features for enterprise Java applications. Red Hat also announced a partnership with Dell that makes RHEL.ai the preferred platform for AI deployments on Dell PowerEdge servers. This innovation is driving organic growth acceleration with increasing contribution from our core watsonx Middleware in data and AI, watsonx Orchestrate and IBM concert in automation and our AI embed strategy across our software portfolio Revenue performance this quarter also benefited from recent software acquisitions. August marked the one year anniversary of the Apptio acquisition, and we're seeing strong synergies with our automation capabilities and broader software portfolio, driving continued acceleration in bookings and ARR growth since close. Additionally, the stream sets of web methods assets are now part of the software business. And we continue to expect the HashiCorp acquisition to close by the end of this year. Moving to software profit. We expanded gross margin and segment profit was up over 120 basis points from last year, as we continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue performance. Consulting revenue was flat, which was at the lower end of our expectations. As we discussed throughout this year, we are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment and see no change in client buying behavior. At the same time, clients are reprioritizing their IT budgets to prepare for generative AI. While demand for large digital transformations remain solid, our overall signings declined for the second consecutive quarter as we wrapped on record third quarter signings from last year. Despite the weak current demand environment, we are well positioned to capture growth from generative AI. We continue to build a solid generative AI book of business with about $1 billion of new bookings in the quarter, as we partner with our clients to design and scale AI solutions and develop new ways of working. This early momentum is important. Engaging with clients as they architect their AI strategies is establishing IBM Consulting as a strategic partner of choice. In the third quarter, our Red Hat practice, which helps clients optimize how they build, deploy and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment continue to grow at a double-digit rate, with this quarter being the largest single quarter of signings since the acquisition of Red Hat. Additionally, within our strategic partnerships, both our AWS and Azure practices continue to contribute robust revenue growth. Turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 2%, driven by strength in transformation projects for data, finance and supply chain. Both technology consulting and application operations declined in the quarter. While there was strength in cloud-based application services across modernization, development and management, we continue to see clients reprioritizing spending away from on-prem customized services. Looking at Consulting profit, we expanded gross profit margin almost 1 point and delivered segment profit margin of 11%, a sequential improvement of 2 points, reflecting yield from our productivity actions. Moving to the Infrastructure segment. revenue was down 7%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Hybrid Infrastructure was down 9%, and infrastructure support declined 3%. Within hybrid infrastructure, IBM Z revenue declined 19% in what is now the tenth quarter of z16 availability. The z16 program continues to exceed prior cycles, delivering revenue growth in eight of the last 10 quarters and program to date installed MIPS are up over 30%. Our clients continue to face increasing demands for workloads given rapid business expansion, complex regulatory environments and increasing cybersecurity threats and attacks. IBM Z remains uniquely positioned to address these demands with the technologies that our latest program offers, embedded AI at scale, quantum safe security and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 3%, with product cycle dynamics impacting our Power business, while we saw solid growth in storage, which continues to take share. For Infrastructure profit, we expanded gross profit margin 120 basis points across the portfolio this quarter. At the same time, segment profit margin was down 110 basis points, driven by continued investments in innovation for our next generation of products. Now, let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. Through the first-nine months of the year, we have grown revenue by 3%, expanded our operating pretax margin by 150 basis points and grown free cash flow by $1.5 billion. We have made solid progress in transitioning our portfolio to a higher growth, higher margin business that is well positioned as we head into next year. With nine months of the year behind us, let me now focus on the fourth quarter. We expect revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter levels. Software revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, and this should continue. We expect low double-digit fourth quarter revenue growth for software, led by Red Hat growth in the mid-teens and continued strength in transaction processing. This now represents strong high-single digit growth for the year. Consulting revenue is up 1% year-to-date, impacted by challenging macroeconomic environment. We expect fourth quarter revenue performance to be similar to the third quarter. This represents the weaker end of our prior expectations of low-single digit revenue growth for the year. And given we are at the end of a multiyear product cycle, we now expect the infrastructure to be about a 1 point impact to IBM for the full year. On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect currency to be about a 0.5 point headwind to revenue growth in the quarter and about 1 point impact of revenue growth for the year. Now turning to profitability. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for operating pretax margin expansion to about 1 point year-to-year well above our model. The strength of this performance is driven by our revenue scale, portfolio mix and productivity initiatives, enabling operating leverage, while providing investment flexibility. Actions taken in the third quarter helped accelerate our productivity initiatives, and we now believe we can achieve approximately $3.5 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024, up from $3 billion. Drilling down on segment margins. We expect Software segment profit margin to expand by well over 1 point for the year. Consulting segment profit margin is now expected to be flat, and we continue to see Infrastructure segment profit margin in the mid to high-teens. Consistent with last year, we are maintaining our full year view of operating tax rate in the mid-teens range. For free cash flow, given the strength of our performance year-to-date, we remain confident in delivering greater than $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We are on track to grow revenue, expand operating profit and grow free cash flow as we close out 2024. This positions us well as we look forward to 2025. We are confident in our portfolio and growth trajectory as we head into 2025, given the acceleration in software, the opportunities ahead of us in Red Hat, our new mainframe cycle and associated hardware and software stack, our generative AI positioning and contribution from acquisitions. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let\u2019s get started.\nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please state your question.\nAmit Daryanani: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, Arvind you talked towards the end of your comments about how IBM portfolio is delivering [Technical Difficulty] organically in '25, I assume. And if I think about the segments, I think the interest on your side is somewhat easy to see with the Z17 cycle, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on how does that inflection pan out on soft print consulting especially consulting after a few quarters of muted growth? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Hey. Thanks, Amit. First, thank you very much for picking up on that comment on upward inflection for '25. That is something which we have worked really hard to achieve and that I'm really proud of what the whole team has gotten there. To be specific on the parts that you just touched on, what about the upward inflection on Software and on Consulting. So if we look at Software, first of all, with Red Hat having just delivered 14%, us expecting similar performance for the next quarter. And given that we get at least six months to nine months\u2019 worth of a look ahead based on the CRPO of Red Hat, we expect that to carry on to next year, that could easily then provide a significant amount of lift to software, perhaps about 3 points of growth for Software overall. Two, we've got very good traction, both in our Gen AI products as well as in our automation suite. And we can look at our pipelines and expect that those will be maintained. Given we have also seen a lot of mainframe deployment, the MIPS underlying capacity there will power ahead the mainframe or the TPS software. You put that together with already announced M&A of HashiCorp and then planned M&A that we will have over the year, and that gives us a lot of confidence on software being at or likely above the model that we had laid out a few years ago. So I think that gives you the pieces in Software. Now on Consulting, I acknowledged in the call that there is some macro issues that will impact discretionary labor. So that is the piece that is there. But that is kind of baked in now to what we have been doing. But as we look forward, our bill-to-book ratio at 1.14 tells us that there is a lot of pent-up demand. As we see this Gen AI pipeline turn from signings into revenue, then we expect to see growth there. And we have a very healthy book of business with the hyperscalers and with our ISV partners, as Jim had talked about. We put all of that together, and we expect to see positive upticks on Consulting. You\u2019ll note, I\u2019m not trying to quantify that as deeply as I did in Software, but it will be upwards. Put that together with what we\u2019ll see in infrastructure where we expect to see significant upticks starting likely around the end of the first half, and that gives us the confidence in 2025.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please state your question\nToni Sacconaghi: Thank you for the question. I just wanted to follow up largely along those lines, Arvind. IBM is a portfolio of many different things. And some years, things go really well, like TPP this year and other things don't go very well like Consulting this year. But if I look back at the last four years, and maybe that's not the right timeframe, you may correct me, growth this year will be 3% or less, and growth has been 3% in three of the last four years. And so I understand that the setup for 2025 is good because of the mainframe cycle and acquisition. But why is -- why should that not be viewed as a one-off just like this year, maybe as a one-off and being below your 4% to 6% model of less than 3% growth? And specifically, for next year, do you think Consulting signings will inflect positively in Q4? Because they've been negative the last two quarters. So if they don't start to pick up, then the leading indicator for consulting actually does not point to growth necessarily for 2025? So if you can address those questions, that would be great. Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Toni, look, let me build on the comments I made in response to Amit's question and then address some of the points you made, Toni. So I'm not sure I would acknowledge that 3% of growth only, while that has been true in many of these years, 2022 was definitely far above that. But let me acknowledge that will also perhaps a one-off with the [indiscernible] revenue now being recognized as intercompany as opposed to intracompany. Now, despite that, we actually had higher revenue than that despite what we explicitly modeled out for the [indiscernible] piece. So -- but let me acknowledge at least in two of the last four years, it was around 3%. So what gives us confidence? So as I began to Amit's question, we've been really hard at work rebuilding our portfolio to be both sustainable and have a lot more value for our clients in terms of the innovation we are delivering them as well as our ability to manage the cost and complexity that they have, as they're all leveraging technology to drive a much larger part of their own businesses. That's kind of the macro. And under that, the fact that 7% of our Software growth this year was organic in this last quarter, not at all acquisitive, gives us confidence about how well that software is being used. 80% of our software is actually now on a recurring revenue basis, that is up significantly over the last few years. Those all tell us real demand in that part of the portfolio. If I turn around and say, it's 80% there, and it generated 10%, that gives us confidence on the organic base of software even going into next year. And as far as we can see, the mainframe software will maintain perhaps mid-single digit growth, not maybe high-single digit growth going into next year. But that gives us really good tailwinds for what we're trying to do there. And while I called out HashiCorp, which has sort of already been announced, we do expect, as we get through that deal, to do a lot more M&A even going into next year. And since our cash flows have gone up from four years ago, that gives us more ability to do M&A without any other actions to speak of. On your Consulting side, while the last year and if I go more than four years ago, have been flat or negative, the confidence we're getting there is from the quality of the signings and from the yields that we expect. The overall signings this year have been lower than last year. But if the signings didn't yield, then they don't mean very much. So it's the yields we worry about. And the backlog that we get that we worry about and we are seeing those begin to turn. Note, I'm muting the word begin to turn. I don't expect consulting to inflect like software and go into double-digits, but I do expect it to turn into a tailwind for us in terms of being positive growth as we are going. And that's why I believe this may be a tale of two halves. The Consulting may be very modest in the first half, but much better in the second half based on what we can see in terms of the signings, the offerings and as the Gen AI book of business turns into real revenue across all of our clients. I hope that, that gives you a sense. And I know we don't talk on Infrastructure and you acknowledge the mainframe cycle. But I also want to call out credit. Inside the Infrastructure business, there is also a recurring revenue business, which is our hardware maintenance business. And that is also a piece that has gone from being a headwind to potentially close to flat next year. So just in year-to-year, that could well be a 4, 5 point tailwind on that part of the business.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question\nWamsi Mohan: Yes. Thank you so much. Jim, in your comments, you noted no change in client buying behavior and consulting. But if we look at what happened with your AI book of business, which is up meaningfully a meaningful part of that being in services, it would indicate that the underlying Consulting business ex, that kind of deteriorated. So I was wondering if you could reconcile that comment with what's happening in Consulting? And secondarily, you noted year-to-date PTI margin performance of 150 bps improvement, but the fiscal year has guided to about 100 basis points, but you also noted sort of realizing $3.5 million of annual run rate savings. So can you just talk about some of the profit dynamics in the fourth quarter? How we should think about some of the puts and takes over there? Thank you so much.\nJames Kavanaugh: Sure, Wamsi. Thank you for the question overall. As Arvind and I said in the prepared remarks, we're obviously operating in a very dynamic, uncertain macroeconomic environment around the entire Consulting market overall. Yes, we posted flat revenue growth overall, by the way, up 1% year-to-date, so a slight deterioration. Underpinning that, I think there is multiple dynamics that are playing out. And let me try to unpack some of these. First, to your question about the opportunity statement. And yes, Gen AI, albeit we're very early in the cycle right now, we are very focused on ensuring we get an enterprise lead position in establishing Consulting as a strategic provider of choice. And we're building that book. If you look at our book of business right now, we exited 90 days ago, IBM above $2 billion, that was about 75% Consulting. Now we're north of $3 billion and about 80% Consulting. So underneath that, we are actually seeing the last two quarters about $1 billion book of business each quarter being generated. Now within that, those are mid to long-term digital transformation Gen AI-based deals. By definition, higher duration, lower revenue yield and I think we spent time last quarter talking about it, about 3 to 4 points less yield than traditional book of business overall. But it's important because it's building that backlog growth that Arvind just answered Toni's question on overall because we believe, albeit we're early, this is a long-term growth vector with a multiplier effect across our platforms, our software, our infrastructure that is an integral part of the integrated value thesis of Consulting here. Now mitigating some of that growth is the high yielding revenue short-term discretionary projects. Those yields are about 4 to 5 points above what we're seeing in Gen AI right now. So I think you're seeing the early cycle dynamics that will put pressure and has put pressure on our top line consulting revenue, but -- and that's why we guided fourth quarter consistent, but more importantly, I would look at the glass half full, we are becoming the strategic provider of choice, we're winning in the Gen AI space around consulting, and that's going to fuel a growth vector around fueling 2025. Now with regards to profit equation. We're very pleased with our fundamentals of our business and the underpinnings of that. We drive operating leverage in this business three different ways. One, high-value portfolio mix, that's why Software is an integral part of our model, approaching 45% of revenue, that growing 10% is a strong profit contributor overall. Two is, we get the high value leverage of a recurring revenue stream overall and productivity. And three, we get that $3.5 billion that we are looking for coming out. We're well ahead of that year-to-date, as you said. I think we're being very prudent on how we're guiding fourth quarter right now. And we'll talk 90 days from now, and we fully expect, by the way, that all drops to the quality in sustainability of free cash flow, we're going to be up well over $1 billion with north of $12 billion this year and will be set up very nicely for 2025.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question\nBenjamin Reitzes: Yeah. Hey, thanks, guys. Jim, we previously spoken about high-single digit growth potential for free cash flow at this company. I was wondering, you've made a lot of comments about 2025, do you think that's possible still in 2025 given the Hashi acquisition? And I want to also see if you can address it. If Consulting were to remain flat, does the mix shift still support that. Thanks a lot.\nJames Kavanaugh: Yes, Ben. Thanks very much for the question. A lot of interest, as you know quite well from our investors on this particular question of our model. I'm not going to get into the specifics as you would probably not expect me to about actual quantification. I think Arvind and I have both said, we feel very confident about our strategy, our portfolio and our growth opportunities heading forward into 2025. But let's take a step back, right? Three years ago, when we laid out our midterm model, Arvind transitioned this company from a no-growth company to a mid-single digit company, a company that was roughly about 10 points of pretax margin to a company that's going to exit this year in the high-teens, growing 700 to 800 basis points over three years and a company that was stagnant to declining free cash flow, and we'll probably grow free cash flow, by the way, exiting 2024, pretty much on top of the absolute number we set in 2022. So I think we made a lot of progress. Now when you talk about going forward, we talk about upward growth inflection. All of you understand the portfolio mix composition in this business, the productivity mindset of what we drive in this company and the competitive business model positioning which I would argue we still have a lot of headroom to continue to grow. Our model has always been to drive operating leverage that enables us to drive free cash flow faster than revenue. And I would fully expect that even with the Hashi dilution that we all acknowledge. We are very excited. We're hoping to close that still by the end of the year, but that transaction stands on its own, strategic value, the attractive financial model and the synergistic value we get across our portfolio of Software and Consulting. And we've got that embedded in our model, and we still feel very confident growing free cash flow faster than revenue.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question\nJames Schneider: Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, if you could maybe comment on the rate at which you're seeing consulting work and the consulting signings you do have translate into revenue and sort of the time to commence then. Is that what's giving you a bit of increased confidence on the inflection in Consulting or the slow improvement in Consulting going to next year? And then maybe just kind of separately, talk about, if you could, the types of M&A targets you're thinking about in Software and how that might be different than what you've done in the past? Are you thinking of things that are in any way different from the sort of open source in Infrastructure and DevOps type of deals that you've done in the past and how that might be changing? Thank you.\nJames Kavanaugh: Great, Jim. Thank you. I'll take the first part of your question, and Arvind can handle the second part about the targeted areas around M&A. As we stated, we feel very good about the strong start in our Gen AI book of business around Consulting. Let's just put some numbers to it, right? IBM north of $3 billion, growing over $1 billion quarter-to-quarter, The Consulting book of business is approaching $2.5 billion. You put that in perspective against the last technological shift that we can see within our business, that being hybrid cloud and Red Hat, and we're about 2x that run rate, because we did about $1 billion in the first 12 months. So we're seeing a very nice acceleration, and we've talked enough about this being very early in the cycle. But that $2.5 billion book of business, that's up almost $1 billion quarter-to-quarter, and it's growing 35% plus. Now when you look at it, the underpinnings, as I said earlier, these are mid to long-term strategic digital transformation Gen AI deals, higher duration. Durations are probably approaching high 40 months overall compared to an average duration in Consulting, that's in the low 20s, point number one. Point number two, I talked about revenue yield being lower, about 3 to 4 points lower. Revenue yields kind of hovering around mid to high-single digit revenue yield. And again, that's about 3 to 4 points less than traditional. But I can't stress enough. I think these curves will inflect as we move into 2025, and -- because as we start wrapping around the short-term discretionary pullback that's impacting that traditional near-term revenue, we're going to start seeing this long-term growth vector pick up as we go forward, which then has multiplier effects of our software and our hardware going forward.\nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Jim. So Jim, let me address the second part of your question. I've been very clear about our M&A strategy. It has to fit our existing strategy. And in this case, for Software, which you asked about, then the three areas would be what are we doing around hybrid cloud. I would say, Hashi's a great example or something in there. What are we doing around automation? Apptio was probably a great example there, but so were some others like Turbonomic and Instana. And then what are we doing around data and AI? Where I would tell you that portions of Software AG fell into that camp. The reason that I want to stick to the lanes we are in is because we get a massive amount of go-to-market synergy and distribution synergy with IBM, which is the second element of the strategy. There has to be synergy with IBM that the target could not have realized on their own. Otherwise, there isn't an economic return for our investors. So those two pieces are essential right now. Now, when we did Red Hat five years ago, and I think that, that was implicit in your question, we did open up a new lane of a big open source play and we have stuck to that through the Red Hat discipline and with that brand name. But not everything needs to be open source. So let me be clear on that. Apptio was not open source. Turbonomic was not open source. When we do find an open source property, that fits all our criteria, we would certainly look at it. But that is not our lens or our filter on looking at things. The filter and lens are looking at things for the three areas that I mentioned as being our strategic fit. Now, Jim made a comment about two questions ago about there being headroom. We see a lot of headroom on these topics and helping people manage their infrastructure better, take cost out, reduce the labor complexity, leverage your data are better, do AI at more cost-efficient methods than everything that we see today. As we go through all of this, once we begin to run out of headroom then we might add some areas, but I don\u2019t see that happening for some years at this point.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please state your question\nBrent Thill: Thanks, Jim. Really good margin on software 30%, well above past Q3s. How sustainable is this 30% margin and any way to frame that going forward? Thanks.\nJames Kavanaugh: Yeah, Brent. Thank you very much for the question. We're obviously very pleased with our software performance. Its core to our strategy overall. Software being about 45% of IBM's revenue composition, and two-thirds of our profit. And most importantly, to Arvind's last question here that he just answered, integral to our hybrid cloud and AI platform centric model. It's all built around software overall. By the way, you probably noticed, we did hit the Rule of 40 here in the third quarter. We feel confident that we continue to strategically reposition our business. And by the way, the margin inflection we've seen over the last three years in software has been both a combination of that revenue inflection and getting into more end markets with the strategic focus both organically and inorganically, that Arvind talked about, hybrid cloud, automation, data and by the way, the inflection of transaction processing, which I'll remind all of you, is a high margin, high profit contribution overall. So that, coupled with the productivity initiatives are enabling us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in innovation while still generating margin and operating leverage going forward. So we feel pretty confident about that continuing. Similar to how I answered the earlier question, we see a lot of headroom in front of us on operating margin continuing both for IBM and for software.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let\u2019s take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question\nErik Woodring: Great. Thank you very much for taking my question. Jim, I wanted to maybe ask the Consulting AI question maybe a different way, which was last quarter, you had noted that Consulting AI projects were largely cannibalizing other areas of Consulting spend. And I'm just curious at what stage do you think these long duration signings turn into recognized revenue and some materiality that, that could really impact the trajectory of the consulting business? And then second, in what situation or environment would we see AI consulting projects turn from cannibal, -- cannibalizing the traditional business to becoming incremental to traditional Consulting? Thanks so much.\nJames Kavanaugh: Yeah. Great. And thanks, Erik, for the question overall. As we talked about, maturity of Gen AI were very early in the cycle. The key for us is to win this early leadership position to be the Gen AI strategic provider of choice. And I think we are carrying our own to say the least right now, given the $2.5 billion book of business. Now with that, higher duration, lower revenue yield, there is revenue yield in the quarter. I don't want to leave anyone without the impression. It's just about 3 to 4 points below what our traditional are because of the longer duration. If I just do some of the mathematics around it, very quick. First, we're going to start wrapping on the pullback when we started talking about the short-term pause in discretionary spending as clients are looking at cost productivity to fuel investment into Gen AI projects that have longer duration. We'll start wrapping on that as we kind of get through the first half of next year, that's point number one. Point number two, that inflection curve, when we just look at what we experienced historically with the Red Hat generation, because in every technological shift human capital and consulting-based business, you're always going to see reprioritization. We've seen it with cloud technology shift. We've seen it with the Internet. We've seen it with globalization. And we've seen it when we went through the hybrid cloud side on Red Hat. That kind of puts it in as Arvind and I have been talking here while we feel very confident in that upward growth inflection in \u201825. Consulting is going to be more of a second half '25 play as we move forward. And by the way, with that upward inflection, the key is backlog. We got to get the volume and demand here in the fourth quarter to Toni's question, and we got to still continue building that volume and demand in the first half because then that will build a multiplier effect that will be a nice, healthy consulting growth orientation like we were at about a year ago.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let\u2019s take one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital. Please state your question\nMatthew Swanson: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. Arvind, you talked about the latest addition of the Granite models being 90% more cost efficient, may be trained in weeks. You've taken a really pragmatic kind of ROI focused approach to Gen AI. Could you just talk a little bit about what you're hearing from enterprises and customers that are kind of supporting that direction of development?\nArvind Krishna: Certainly, Matt, and thank you for that question, and for picking up on the Granite models. Look, as I started talking to customers on this topic about 1.5 years ago, there was a lot of excitement around Gen AI deployment inside the enterprise. But you could see some people beginning to do the math and say, hang on, if I really use this at full scale for all of the transactions that happen inside our enterprise, then the bill could easily become tens of millions a day, which very quickly becomes multiple billions a year and while that was advantageous to do it, they didn't see that kind of cost being affordable. So we sat back and said, how big do these models need to be, because the size of the model determines or did determine previously performance as well as the cost. And so the question became, could we do a model that had tens of billions of parameters and was as good, but for a more constrained set of tasks. I kind of be a little facetious. Look, if you're running a big consumer model and you have no idea, is the person going to ask you to summarize a document or a piece of X, which they do, or they're going to ask you to write a poem or a haiku or translate finish to French. Okay, You got to have a model that does all those things. But if we need a model that can summarize the business document, but at much higher quality, that allows us to bring a model with about in this case, to be precise, 8 billion to 30 billion parameters. That is as good as the biggest model for those tasks, but doesn't do all those other things. But for the enterprise, that does 100% of their use case and literally, in this case, could run with 97% more efficiency. Then giving it to people with the indemnity with the licensing that they can actually refine it and they don't owe the refinements or any improvements in the model back to us, we think is a winning hand as enterprises deploy more and more of generative AI. So with that, let me now wrap up the call. In the third quarter of '24, we accelerated our Software performance, including Red Hat. We are excited about the positioning of our portfolio and our growth prospects for 2025, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we close out the year. Thank you.\nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Arvind. Operator, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us today. Let me start by discussing the quarter before I get into more detail on the execution of our strategy. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in software with the reacceleration in Red Hat and continued strength in transaction processing. Infrastructure reflects product cycle dynamics with z16 well ahead of prior cycles, highlighting customer adoption and continued reliance on the mainframe. In consulting, we continue to navigate an uncertain macro environment with results at the lower end of our expectations. We generated strong operating profitability and the highest levels of first-nine months cash generation in many years, while overall revenue performance was mixed. We continue to reposition our portfolio towards a higher growth, higher margin business that is well positioned to address client needs around hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. I'll start with a few thoughts on the macroeconomic environment. Technology spending remains strong. Businesses view technology as a source of competitive advantage allowing them to scale operations, improve productivity and drive growth. However, a pause in discretionary spending is impacting our consulting business. This is due to economic uncertainty which stems from several temporary factors, including geopolitical issues, upcoming elections and the changing landscape of interest rates and inflation levels. The consulting market remains dynamic with significant opportunity as clients prepare for AI. Overall, we are confident in our business and our ability to capture these opportunities. Now turning to our performance. Software is nearly 45% of our total revenue, up from the high-20s in 2018, a testament to our focus on organic innovation and repositioning our portfolio. You can see this in our quarterly results as we delivered strong and accelerating software revenue growth of 10%, including Red Hat at 14%, 7 points of organic growth and strength across our key platforms. Software segment profit margin was about 30%. Our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of annual software revenue, continues to deliver strong growth. ARR for hybrid platform and solutions now stands at $14.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year. This quarter marks the five year anniversary of our acquisition of Red Hat and I am proud of our accomplishments together. Since IBM announced the acquisition, Red Hat revenue has grown to approximately $6.5 billion, doubling in size and delivering a mid-teens CAGR. OpenShift scaled from about $100 million in ARR to $1.3 billion, expanding more than 10 times. Red Hat has also continued to diversify its global footprint expanding into many new countries since acquisition. We continue to drive innovation, announcing new capabilities, including Ansible 2.5, RHEL.ai and OpenShift AI. Red Hat was also named a leader for the second consecutive year in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Container Management. We continue to gain traction in enterprise AI. Our book of business related to generative AI is now over $3 billion inception to date, up more than $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. The mix is roughly one-fifth software and four-fifth consulting signings. This performance has placed us in an early leadership position, which is crucial at the onset of any technology shift. The AI portfolio we have built is designed to give clients a comprehensive set of tools to deploy AI within their enterprise. RHEL.ai and OpenShift AI allow clients to build a consistent AI foundation based on open source technology, while watsonx provides an AI middleware platform. Our assistants are designed to help clients become more productive using AI across a variety of business processes from code to HR, customer service and more. Consulting is helping clients design and execute AI strategies. We also continue to see our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients bring AI to their data. Choosing the right AI model is top of mind for our clients. IBM's Granite family of AI models are fit for purpose. Earlier this year, we released code models with 8 billion to 34 billion parameters. This month, we updated Granite models, making them approximately 90% more cost efficient than larger models. These models can be trained in weeks instead of months and are easier to fine-tune for specific tasks. Granite models are available on watsonx and Red Hat and are also integrated into offerings from partners like AWS, Salesforce, Qualcomm and SAP. Globally, clients are turning to IBM to transform their operations with technology. This quarter, we announced new collaborations with NatWest, Telefonica, Samsung SDS, Toyota Systems and many others. At the U.S. Open, IBM delivered AI-generated match report summaries and we are collaborating with ESPN to enhance the sports coverage through advanced AI insights. We also continue to deepen our relationships with key technology partners, including Dell, Intel, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP and ServiceNow. We remain focused on delivering innovations to the market. For example, this quarter, we announced Telum II, IBM's next-generation processor for Z and the Spyre Accelerator, which will significantly enhance IBM Z's AI capabilities and processing power for enterprise scale applications. Investment in emerging technologies also remains a focus for IBM. Earlier this month, we opened Europe's first IBM Quantum Data Center. This is the second IBM Quantum data center deployed globally, which will greatly advance our goal of expanding access to the world's most performant quantum computers. Before I conclude, let me touch on our outlook. The momentum in our software strategy can be seen in our year-to-date results. Our revenue guidance for the fourth quarter reflects this progress, balanced by macro dynamics in Consulting and Infrastructure product cycle dynamics. We remain confident in our free cash flow guidance which we raised in July, driven by continued strength in our operating margin performance. Overall, our portfolio is well positioned to deliver an upward inflection in growth in 2025. I'm excited about the opportunities ahead of us and will share more details with you in January. I will now hand over to Jim to walk you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you. Hey. Thanks, Amit. First, thank you very much for picking up on that comment on upward inflection for '25. That is something which we have worked really hard to achieve and that I'm really proud of what the whole team has gotten there. To be specific on the parts that you just touched on, what about the upward inflection on Software and on Consulting. So if we look at Software, first of all, with Red Hat having just delivered 14%, us expecting similar performance for the next quarter. And given that we get at least six months to nine months' worth of a look ahead based on the CRPO of Red Hat, we expect that to carry on to next year, that could easily then provide a significant amount of lift to software, perhaps about 3 points of growth for Software overall. Two, we've got very good traction, both in our Gen AI products as well as in our automation suite. And we can look at our pipelines and expect that those will be maintained. Given we have also seen a lot of mainframe deployment, the MIPS underlying capacity there will power ahead the mainframe or the TPS software. You put that together with already announced M&A of HashiCorp and then planned M&A that we will have over the year, and that gives us a lot of confidence on software being at or likely above the model that we had laid out a few years ago. So I think that gives you the pieces in Software. Now on Consulting, I acknowledged in the call that there is some macro issues that will impact discretionary labor. So that is the piece that is there. But that is kind of baked in now to what we have been doing. But as we look forward, our bill-to-book ratio at 1.14 tells us that there is a lot of pent-up demand. As we see this Gen AI pipeline turn from signings into revenue, then we expect to see growth there. And we have a very healthy book of business with the hyperscalers and with our ISV partners, as Jim had talked about. We put all of that together, and we expect to see positive upticks on Consulting. You'll note, I'm not trying to quantify that as deeply as I did in Software, but it will be upwards. Put that together with what we'll see in infrastructure where we expect to see significant upticks starting likely around the end of the first half, and that gives us the confidence in 2025. Toni, look, let me build on the comments I made in response to Amit's question and then address some of the points you made, Toni. So I'm not sure I would acknowledge that 3% of growth only, while that has been true in many of these years, 2022 was definitely far above that. But let me acknowledge that will also perhaps a one-off with the [indiscernible] revenue now being recognized as intercompany as opposed to intracompany. Now, despite that, we actually had higher revenue than that despite what we explicitly modeled out for the [indiscernible] piece. So -- but let me acknowledge at least in two of the last four years, it was around 3%. So what gives us confidence? So as I began to Amit's question, we've been really hard at work rebuilding our portfolio to be both sustainable and have a lot more value for our clients in terms of the innovation we are delivering them as well as our ability to manage the cost and complexity that they have, as they're all leveraging technology to drive a much larger part of their own businesses. That's kind of the macro. And under that, the fact that 7% of our Software growth this year was organic in this last quarter, not at all acquisitive, gives us confidence about how well that software is being used. 80% of our software is actually now on a recurring revenue basis, that is up significantly over the last few years. Those all tell us real demand in that part of the portfolio. If I turn around and say, it's 80% there, and it generated 10%, that gives us confidence on the organic base of software even going into next year. And as far as we can see, the mainframe software will maintain perhaps mid-single digit growth, not maybe high-single digit growth going into next year. But that gives us really good tailwinds for what we're trying to do there. And while I called out HashiCorp, which has sort of already been announced, we do expect, as we get through that deal, to do a lot more M&A even going into next year. And since our cash flows have gone up from four years ago, that gives us more ability to do M&A without any other actions to speak of. On your Consulting side, while the last year and if I go more than four years ago, have been flat or negative, the confidence we're getting there is from the quality of the signings and from the yields that we expect. The overall signings this year have been lower than last year. But if the signings didn't yield, then they don't mean very much. So it's the yields we worry about. And the backlog that we get that we worry about and we are seeing those begin to turn. Note, I'm muting the word begin to turn. I don't expect consulting to inflect like software and go into double-digits, but I do expect it to turn into a tailwind for us in terms of being positive growth as we are going. And that's why I believe this may be a tale of two halves. The Consulting may be very modest in the first half, but much better in the second half based on what we can see in terms of the signings, the offerings and as the Gen AI book of business turns into real revenue across all of our clients. I hope that, that gives you a sense. And I know we don't talk on Infrastructure and you acknowledge the mainframe cycle. But I also want to call out credit. Inside the Infrastructure business, there is also a recurring revenue business, which is our hardware maintenance business. And that is also a piece that has gone from being a headwind to potentially close to flat next year. So just in year-to-year, that could well be a 4, 5 point tailwind on that part of the business. Thanks, Jim. So Jim, let me address the second part of your question. I've been very clear about our M&A strategy. It has to fit our existing strategy. And in this case, for Software, which you asked about, then the three areas would be what are we doing around hybrid cloud. I would say, Hashi's a great example or something in there. What are we doing around automation? Apptio was probably a great example there, but so were some others like Turbonomic and Instana. And then what are we doing around data and AI? Where I would tell you that portions of Software AG fell into that camp. The reason that I want to stick to the lanes we are in is because we get a massive amount of go-to-market synergy and distribution synergy with IBM, which is the second element of the strategy. There has to be synergy with IBM that the target could not have realized on their own. Otherwise, there isn't an economic return for our investors. So those two pieces are essential right now. Now, when we did Red Hat five years ago, and I think that, that was implicit in your question, we did open up a new lane of a big open source play and we have stuck to that through the Red Hat discipline and with that brand name. But not everything needs to be open source. So let me be clear on that. Apptio was not open source. Turbonomic was not open source. When we do find an open source property, that fits all our criteria, we would certainly look at it. But that is not our lens or our filter on looking at things. The filter and lens are looking at things for the three areas that I mentioned as being our strategic fit. Now, Jim made a comment about two questions ago about there being headroom. We see a lot of headroom on these topics and helping people manage their infrastructure better, take cost out, reduce the labor complexity, leverage your data are better, do AI at more cost-efficient methods than everything that we see today. As we go through all of this, once we begin to run out of headroom then we might add some areas, but I don't see that happening for some years at this point. Certainly, Matt, and thank you for that question, and for picking up on the Granite models. Look, as I started talking to customers on this topic about 1.5 years ago, there was a lot of excitement around Gen AI deployment inside the enterprise. But you could see some people beginning to do the math and say, hang on, if I really use this at full scale for all of the transactions that happen inside our enterprise, then the bill could easily become tens of millions a day, which very quickly becomes multiple billions a year and while that was advantageous to do it, they didn't see that kind of cost being affordable. So we sat back and said, how big do these models need to be, because the size of the model determines or did determine previously performance as well as the cost. And so the question became, could we do a model that had tens of billions of parameters and was as good, but for a more constrained set of tasks. I kind of be a little facetious. Look, if you're running a big consumer model and you have no idea, is the person going to ask you to summarize a document or a piece of X, which they do, or they're going to ask you to write a poem or a haiku or translate finish to French. Okay, You got to have a model that does all those things. But if we need a model that can summarize the business document, but at much higher quality, that allows us to bring a model with about in this case, to be precise, 8 billion to 30 billion parameters. That is as good as the biggest model for those tasks, but doesn't do all those other things. But for the enterprise, that does 100% of their use case and literally, in this case, could run with 97% more efficiency. Then giving it to people with the indemnity with the licensing that they can actually refine it and they don't owe the refinements or any improvements in the model back to us, we think is a winning hand as enterprises deploy more and more of generative AI. So with that, let me now wrap up the call. In the third quarter of '24, we accelerated our Software performance, including Red Hat. We are excited about the positioning of our portfolio and our growth prospects for 2025, and we look forward to sharing our progress with you as we close out the year. Thank you."

            "name": "James Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. In the third quarter, we delivered $15 billion in revenue, $3.8 billion of adjusted EBITDA, $2.5 billion of operating pretax income, and $2.30 operating diluted earnings per share. And through the first-nine months, we generated $6.6 billion of free cash flow. We are pleased with the solid operating profitability and free cash flow generation of the business. Revenue growth, combined with 100 basis points of operating pretax margin expansion drove 8% operating pretax profit growth, and 5% operating diluted earnings per share growth. Our revenue growth for the quarter was up 2% at constant currency. Software growth accelerated to 10%, with strength across our key platforms of Red Hat, automation, data and AI and transaction processing. Consulting was flat and continue to be impacted by a dynamic market environment as clients reprioritized spending and infrastructure was down 7%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Our portfolio mix, operating leverage and yield from productivity initiatives generated strong gross margin, operating profit and free cash flow performance. These results represent our highest third quarter levels of gross margin and free cash flow in many years. We expanded operating gross margin by 210 basis points and operating pretax margin by 100 basis points over last year. Year-to-date, operating pretax margin is up 150 basis points, well ahead of our guidance provided in July of over 50 basis points of improvement in 2024. In September, we closed on the Palo Alto QRadar transaction, generating a pretax gain of about $350 million in the quarter. As we previously discussed, this was substantially offset by the charges we took to address stranded costs and accelerate our productivity initiatives. These productivity initiatives allowed for continued investment to drive innovation, which you can see in our higher R&D expense up 10% year-to-date. Year-to-date, we generated $6.6 billion of free cash flow, up $1.5 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this year-to-date growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up about $800 million year-over-year. This quarter, we realized $500 million in proceeds from the Palo Alto QRadar transaction. As I mentioned last quarter, for the full year, we expect only a modest contribution of free cash flow given payouts from structural actions we have taken and foregone profit from the QRadar business. Through the first-nine months of the year, excluding the impact of the QRadar transaction, we are several points ahead of our two year average attainment levels. In terms of cash uses, year-to-date we returned $4.6 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a strong liquidity position with cash of about $14 billion. Our debt balance at the end of the third quarter was flat with year-end 2023 at $56.6 billion, including $10.4 billion from our financing business. Turning to the segments. Software revenue growth accelerated to 10%, with broad-based growth across the portfolio. This reflects the repositioning of software around key growth platforms: Hybrid cloud, automation, data and transaction processing, where we deliver a differentiated value proposition to address clients' most pressing needs. Growth this quarter was fueled by the same performance drivers we've highlighted throughout the year. Red Hat accelerated, contributing about 3.5 points of growth to software. The combination of innovation and recurring revenue contributed about 3.5 points to growth. And our focused M&A strategy contributed about 3 points of growth. Let me take you through some more details on each of these. Red Hat revenue growth accelerated to 14%, up 6 points sequentially. We gained market share across each of our key solutions, with OpenShift and Ansible growing more than 20% and RHEL growing in the double-digits. This strength reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions as clients continue to prioritize application modernization on OpenShift containers and Ansible automation to optimize their IT spend and reduce operational complexity. We saw strong acceleration in Red Hat's subscription business, while the consumption-based services business stabilized as we expected. Looking at our revenue under contract over the next six months, this metric continues to grow in the mid-teens as our annual bookings grew double-digits in the third quarter. We are excited about the opportunities ahead of us, including generative AI, early client interest in our virtualization solution and after the deal completion, potential synergies with HashiCorp. We delivered strong growth in our recurring revenue base and are seeing momentum from innovation across our software portfolio. Hybrid platform and solutions ARR was $14.9 billion, up 11% year-over-year, driven by strength across automation, data and AI and Red Hat. Transaction processing grew 9% in the quarter, growing capacity, solid renewal rates and continued customer interest in our new generative AI product, watsonx Code Assistant for Z contributed to growth. We continue to invest in bringing innovation to market, launching new offerings like RHEL.ai, Ansible 2.5 and updated capabilities to our family of assistance including the recently announced watsonx Code Assistant with advanced features for enterprise Java applications. Red Hat also announced a partnership with Dell that makes RHEL.ai the preferred platform for AI deployments on Dell PowerEdge servers. This innovation is driving organic growth acceleration with increasing contribution from our core watsonx Middleware in data and AI, watsonx Orchestrate and IBM concert in automation and our AI embed strategy across our software portfolio Revenue performance this quarter also benefited from recent software acquisitions. August marked the one year anniversary of the Apptio acquisition, and we're seeing strong synergies with our automation capabilities and broader software portfolio, driving continued acceleration in bookings and ARR growth since close. Additionally, the stream sets of web methods assets are now part of the software business. And we continue to expect the HashiCorp acquisition to close by the end of this year. Moving to software profit. We expanded gross margin and segment profit was up over 120 basis points from last year, as we continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue performance. Consulting revenue was flat, which was at the lower end of our expectations. As we discussed throughout this year, we are operating in a challenging macroeconomic environment and see no change in client buying behavior. At the same time, clients are reprioritizing their IT budgets to prepare for generative AI. While demand for large digital transformations remain solid, our overall signings declined for the second consecutive quarter as we wrapped on record third quarter signings from last year. Despite the weak current demand environment, we are well positioned to capture growth from generative AI. We continue to build a solid generative AI book of business with about $1 billion of new bookings in the quarter, as we partner with our clients to design and scale AI solutions and develop new ways of working. This early momentum is important. Engaging with clients as they architect their AI strategies is establishing IBM Consulting as a strategic partner of choice. In the third quarter, our Red Hat practice, which helps clients optimize how they build, deploy and manage applications for a hybrid cloud environment continue to grow at a double-digit rate, with this quarter being the largest single quarter of signings since the acquisition of Red Hat. Additionally, within our strategic partnerships, both our AWS and Azure practices continue to contribute robust revenue growth. Turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 2%, driven by strength in transformation projects for data, finance and supply chain. Both technology consulting and application operations declined in the quarter. While there was strength in cloud-based application services across modernization, development and management, we continue to see clients reprioritizing spending away from on-prem customized services. Looking at Consulting profit, we expanded gross profit margin almost 1 point and delivered segment profit margin of 11%, a sequential improvement of 2 points, reflecting yield from our productivity actions. Moving to the Infrastructure segment. revenue was down 7%, reflecting product cycle dynamics. Hybrid Infrastructure was down 9%, and infrastructure support declined 3%. Within hybrid infrastructure, IBM Z revenue declined 19% in what is now the tenth quarter of z16 availability. The z16 program continues to exceed prior cycles, delivering revenue growth in eight of the last 10 quarters and program to date installed MIPS are up over 30%. Our clients continue to face increasing demands for workloads given rapid business expansion, complex regulatory environments and increasing cybersecurity threats and attacks. IBM Z remains uniquely positioned to address these demands with the technologies that our latest program offers, embedded AI at scale, quantum safe security and cloud-native development for hybrid cloud. Distributed infrastructure revenue was down 3%, with product cycle dynamics impacting our Power business, while we saw solid growth in storage, which continues to take share. For Infrastructure profit, we expanded gross profit margin 120 basis points across the portfolio this quarter. At the same time, segment profit margin was down 110 basis points, driven by continued investments in innovation for our next generation of products. Now, let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. Through the first-nine months of the year, we have grown revenue by 3%, expanded our operating pretax margin by 150 basis points and grown free cash flow by $1.5 billion. We have made solid progress in transitioning our portfolio to a higher growth, higher margin business that is well positioned as we head into next year. With nine months of the year behind us, let me now focus on the fourth quarter. We expect revenue growth in the fourth quarter to be consistent with the third quarter levels. Software revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, and this should continue. We expect low double-digit fourth quarter revenue growth for software, led by Red Hat growth in the mid-teens and continued strength in transaction processing. This now represents strong high-single digit growth for the year. Consulting revenue is up 1% year-to-date, impacted by challenging macroeconomic environment. We expect fourth quarter revenue performance to be similar to the third quarter. This represents the weaker end of our prior expectations of low-single digit revenue growth for the year. And given we are at the end of a multiyear product cycle, we now expect the infrastructure to be about a 1 point impact to IBM for the full year. On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect currency to be about a 0.5 point headwind to revenue growth in the quarter and about 1 point impact of revenue growth for the year. Now turning to profitability. For the full year, we are raising our expectation for operating pretax margin expansion to about 1 point year-to-year well above our model. The strength of this performance is driven by our revenue scale, portfolio mix and productivity initiatives, enabling operating leverage, while providing investment flexibility. Actions taken in the third quarter helped accelerate our productivity initiatives, and we now believe we can achieve approximately $3.5 billion in annual run rate savings by the end of 2024, up from $3 billion. Drilling down on segment margins. We expect Software segment profit margin to expand by well over 1 point for the year. Consulting segment profit margin is now expected to be flat, and we continue to see Infrastructure segment profit margin in the mid to high-teens. Consistent with last year, we are maintaining our full year view of operating tax rate in the mid-teens range. For free cash flow, given the strength of our performance year-to-date, we remain confident in delivering greater than $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. We are on track to grow revenue, expand operating profit and grow free cash flow as we close out 2024. This positions us well as we look forward to 2025. We are confident in our portfolio and growth trajectory as we head into 2025, given the acceleration in software, the opportunities ahead of us in Red Hat, our new mainframe cycle and associated hardware and software stack, our generative AI positioning and contribution from acquisitions. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started. Sure, Wamsi. Thank you for the question overall. As Arvind and I said in the prepared remarks, we're obviously operating in a very dynamic, uncertain macroeconomic environment around the entire Consulting market overall. Yes, we posted flat revenue growth overall, by the way, up 1% year-to-date, so a slight deterioration. Underpinning that, I think there is multiple dynamics that are playing out. And let me try to unpack some of these. First, to your question about the opportunity statement. And yes, Gen AI, albeit we're very early in the cycle right now, we are very focused on ensuring we get an enterprise lead position in establishing Consulting as a strategic provider of choice. And we're building that book. If you look at our book of business right now, we exited 90 days ago, IBM above $2 billion, that was about 75% Consulting. Now we're north of $3 billion and about 80% Consulting. So underneath that, we are actually seeing the last two quarters about $1 billion book of business each quarter being generated. Now within that, those are mid to long-term digital transformation Gen AI-based deals. By definition, higher duration, lower revenue yield and I think we spent time last quarter talking about it, about 3 to 4 points less yield than traditional book of business overall. But it's important because it's building that backlog growth that Arvind just answered Toni's question on overall because we believe, albeit we're early, this is a long-term growth vector with a multiplier effect across our platforms, our software, our infrastructure that is an integral part of the integrated value thesis of Consulting here. Now mitigating some of that growth is the high yielding revenue short-term discretionary projects. Those yields are about 4 to 5 points above what we're seeing in Gen AI right now. So I think you're seeing the early cycle dynamics that will put pressure and has put pressure on our top line consulting revenue, but -- and that's why we guided fourth quarter consistent, but more importantly, I would look at the glass half full, we are becoming the strategic provider of choice, we're winning in the Gen AI space around consulting, and that's going to fuel a growth vector around fueling 2025. Now with regards to profit equation. We're very pleased with our fundamentals of our business and the underpinnings of that. We drive operating leverage in this business three different ways. One, high-value portfolio mix, that's why Software is an integral part of our model, approaching 45% of revenue, that growing 10% is a strong profit contributor overall. Two is, we get the high value leverage of a recurring revenue stream overall and productivity. And three, we get that $3.5 billion that we are looking for coming out. We're well ahead of that year-to-date, as you said. I think we're being very prudent on how we're guiding fourth quarter right now. And we'll talk 90 days from now, and we fully expect, by the way, that all drops to the quality in sustainability of free cash flow, we're going to be up well over $1 billion with north of $12 billion this year and will be set up very nicely for 2025. Yes, Ben. Thanks very much for the question. A lot of interest, as you know quite well from our investors on this particular question of our model. I'm not going to get into the specifics as you would probably not expect me to about actual quantification. I think Arvind and I have both said, we feel very confident about our strategy, our portfolio and our growth opportunities heading forward into 2025. But let's take a step back, right? Three years ago, when we laid out our midterm model, Arvind transitioned this company from a no-growth company to a mid-single digit company, a company that was roughly about 10 points of pretax margin to a company that's going to exit this year in the high-teens, growing 700 to 800 basis points over three years and a company that was stagnant to declining free cash flow, and we'll probably grow free cash flow, by the way, exiting 2024, pretty much on top of the absolute number we set in 2022. So I think we made a lot of progress. Now when you talk about going forward, we talk about upward growth inflection. All of you understand the portfolio mix composition in this business, the productivity mindset of what we drive in this company and the competitive business model positioning which I would argue we still have a lot of headroom to continue to grow. Our model has always been to drive operating leverage that enables us to drive free cash flow faster than revenue. And I would fully expect that even with the Hashi dilution that we all acknowledge. We are very excited. We're hoping to close that still by the end of the year, but that transaction stands on its own, strategic value, the attractive financial model and the synergistic value we get across our portfolio of Software and Consulting. And we've got that embedded in our model, and we still feel very confident growing free cash flow faster than revenue. Great, Jim. Thank you. I'll take the first part of your question, and Arvind can handle the second part about the targeted areas around M&A. As we stated, we feel very good about the strong start in our Gen AI book of business around Consulting. Let's just put some numbers to it, right? IBM north of $3 billion, growing over $1 billion quarter-to-quarter, The Consulting book of business is approaching $2.5 billion. You put that in perspective against the last technological shift that we can see within our business, that being hybrid cloud and Red Hat, and we're about 2x that run rate, because we did about $1 billion in the first 12 months. So we're seeing a very nice acceleration, and we've talked enough about this being very early in the cycle. But that $2.5 billion book of business, that's up almost $1 billion quarter-to-quarter, and it's growing 35% plus. Now when you look at it, the underpinnings, as I said earlier, these are mid to long-term strategic digital transformation Gen AI deals, higher duration. Durations are probably approaching high 40 months overall compared to an average duration in Consulting, that's in the low 20s, point number one. Point number two, I talked about revenue yield being lower, about 3 to 4 points lower. Revenue yields kind of hovering around mid to high-single digit revenue yield. And again, that's about 3 to 4 points less than traditional. But I can't stress enough. I think these curves will inflect as we move into 2025, and -- because as we start wrapping around the short-term discretionary pullback that's impacting that traditional near-term revenue, we're going to start seeing this long-term growth vector pick up as we go forward, which then has multiplier effects of our software and our hardware going forward. Yeah, Brent. Thank you very much for the question. We're obviously very pleased with our software performance. Its core to our strategy overall. Software being about 45% of IBM's revenue composition, and two-thirds of our profit. And most importantly, to Arvind's last question here that he just answered, integral to our hybrid cloud and AI platform centric model. It's all built around software overall. By the way, you probably noticed, we did hit the Rule of 40 here in the third quarter. We feel confident that we continue to strategically reposition our business. And by the way, the margin inflection we've seen over the last three years in software has been both a combination of that revenue inflection and getting into more end markets with the strategic focus both organically and inorganically, that Arvind talked about, hybrid cloud, automation, data and by the way, the inflection of transaction processing, which I'll remind all of you, is a high margin, high profit contribution overall. So that, coupled with the productivity initiatives are enabling us with the financial flexibility to continue to invest in innovation while still generating margin and operating leverage going forward. So we feel pretty confident about that continuing. Similar to how I answered the earlier question, we see a lot of headroom in front of us on operating margin continuing both for IBM and for software. Yeah. Great. And thanks, Erik, for the question overall. As we talked about, maturity of Gen AI were very early in the cycle. The key for us is to win this early leadership position to be the Gen AI strategic provider of choice. And I think we are carrying our own to say the least right now, given the $2.5 billion book of business. Now with that, higher duration, lower revenue yield, there is revenue yield in the quarter. I don't want to leave anyone without the impression. It's just about 3 to 4 points below what our traditional are because of the longer duration. If I just do some of the mathematics around it, very quick. First, we're going to start wrapping on the pullback when we started talking about the short-term pause in discretionary spending as clients are looking at cost productivity to fuel investment into Gen AI projects that have longer duration. We'll start wrapping on that as we kind of get through the first half of next year, that's point number one. Point number two, that inflection curve, when we just look at what we experienced historically with the Red Hat generation, because in every technological shift human capital and consulting-based business, you're always going to see reprioritization. We've seen it with cloud technology shift. We've seen it with the Internet. We've seen it with globalization. And we've seen it when we went through the hybrid cloud side on Red Hat. That kind of puts it in as Arvind and I have been talking here while we feel very confident in that upward growth inflection in \u201825. Consulting is going to be more of a second half '25 play as we move forward. And by the way, with that upward inflection, the key is backlog. We got to get the volume and demand here in the fourth quarter to Toni's question, and we got to still continue building that volume and demand in the first half because then that will build a multiplier effect that will be a nice, healthy consulting growth orientation like we were at about a year ago."

We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200bArvind Krishna: Thank you for joining us today to discuss IBM's Second Quarter Earnings. We delivered a strong quarter, exceeding our expectations, driven by solid revenue growth, profitability, and cash-flow generation. We had strong performance in software and infrastructure above our model as investment in innovation is yielding organic growth, while consulting remained below model. Our results underscore the continued success of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy and the strength of our diversified business. Let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. Technology spending remains robust as it continues to serve as a key competitive advantage, allowing businesses to scale, drive efficiencies and fuel growth. As we stated last quarter, factors such as interest rates and inflation impacted timing of decision making and discretionary spend in consulting. Overall, we remain confident in the positive macro outlook for technology spending, but acknowledge this impact. It has been a year since we introduced watsonx and our generative AI strategy to the market. We have infused AI across the business from the tools clients use to manage and optimize their hybrid cloud environments to our platform products across.ai,.data and.gov to infrastructure and consulting, you can find AI innovation in all of our segments. For example, in software, our broad suite of automation products like Apptio and watsonx Orchestrate are leveraging AI and we expect to do the same with HashiCorp once the acquisition is complete. Red Hat is bringing AI to OpenShift AI and rhel.ai. In transaction processing, we are seeing early momentum in watsonx Code Assistant for Z. In infrastructure, IBM Z is equipped with real-time AI inferencing capabilities. In consulting, our experts are helping clients design and implement AI strategies. Our enterprise AI strategy is resonating as we evolve to meet client needs. Let me start by discussing IBM models. Choosing the right AI model is crucial for success in scaling AI. While large general-purpose models are great for starting on AI use cases, clients are finding that smaller models are essential for cost-effective AI strategies. Smaller models are also much easier to customize and tune. IBM's Granite models ranging from 3 billion to 34 billion parameters and trained on 116 programming languages consistently achieved top performance for a variety of coding tasks. To put costs in perspective, these fit-for-purpose models can be approximately 90% less expensive than large models. Hybrid cloud remains a top priority for clients as flexibility of deployment of AI models across multiple environments and data sovereignty remain a key focus. We believe in the power of open innovation and recently announced at IBM Think that we open-sourced IBM's Granite family of models now available under Apache 2.0 licenses on both Hugging Face and GitHub. We see parallel to Linux becoming dominant in the enterprise server space, thanks to the speed and innovation offered by open-source. We are confident that the same dynamic will play out with AI as we benefit from developer mindshare and community innovation. We also recently launched InstructLab, a tool for more rapid model tuning through synthetic data generation, allowing our clients to more efficiently customize models using their own data and expertise. The last 12 months of AI pilots has made it clear that sustained value from AI requires truly leveraging enterprise data. In summary, our AI strategy is a comprehensive platform play. Rhel.ai and OpenShift AI are the foundation of our enterprise AI platform. They combine open-source IBM Granite's LLMs and InstructLab model alignment tools with full stack optimization, enterprise-grade security and support and model indemnification. On top of that, we have an enterprise AI middleware platform with watsonx and an embed strategy with our AI assistance infused through our software portfolio and those of our ecosystem partners. In addition, our consulting services are critical in helping clients build their AI strategies from the ground-up. We also continue to see our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. Our book of business related to generative AI now stands at greater than $2 billion inception-to-date. The mix is roughly one quarter software and three quarters consulting signings. We believe these strong results highlight our momentum and traction with clients. Our early leadership positions us for long-term success and this transformational technology, which is still in the initial stages of adoption. As clients build our AI strategies, the IT landscape is becoming increasingly complex. Labor demographic shifts further emphasize the importance of optimizing IT spend and automating business processes. We continue to innovate and invest and have created a leading automation portfolio to capture this opportunity, which you can see in our results. This includes Apptio for cost management, capability for observability and resource management and with announced acquisition of HashiCorp, the automation of cloud infrastructure. The powerful combination of Red Hat Ansible and Terraform will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. The latest addition to this portfolio is IBM Concert, also announced at Think, a Gen AI-powered tool, which helped clients get end-to-end visibility across business applications. We also recently completed the acquisition of the StreamSets and webMethods assets from Software AG. This acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management and data ingestion. Let me now spend a minute on the continued strength we are seeing in infrastructure. IBM Z, our mainframe solution is an integral part of our clients' hybrid cloud environments, driving their most secure and mission-critical workloads. Our latest cycle z16 is uniquely tailored to offer clients security, scalability and resilience, which help clients address both cybersecurity threats and complex regulatory requirements. z16's Telum processor is a unique differentiator driving real-time, in-line AI inferencing at unprecedented speed and scale for applications like real-time fraud detection. Our storage offerings are also benefiting from generative AI as clients address data readiness and need high-speed access to massive volumes of unstructured data. We continue to invest in innovation and make great progress in emerging technology like quantum computing. This quarter, we expanded Qiskit, IBM's quantum computing software into a comprehensive stack aimed at optimizing performance on the utility-scale quantum hardware. These updates aim to enhance the stability, efficiency and usability of Qiskit, supporting advanced quantum algorithm development and fostering broader adoption across various industries. This strong momentum and innovation across the portfolio manifests itself in client adoption. In virtually all industries and geographies, clients leverage IBM solutions to help them transform their operations and create better experiences for end users. Names like Virgin Money, Credit Mutuel and Panasonic all turned to IBM in the quarter. We also continued to strengthen our ecosystem. At our Think event, we announced a series of new AI partnerships with industry leaders like Adobe, AWS, Microsoft, Meta, Mistral, Salesforce and SAP. In May, IBM and Palo Alto Networks announced a partnership to deliver AI-powered security solutions using What's the Next. As part of this, Palo Alto is acquiring IBM's QRadar SaaS assets and we are partnering to offer seamless migration for QRadar customers to XM. IBM will train over 1,000 security consultants on Palo Alto Network products to drive a significant book of business with them. In summary, we are excited to continue delivering strong results. Given our first-half performance, we are raising our expectations for free cash flow to greater than $12 billion for the year. I will now hand over to Jim to walk you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. In the second quarter, we delivered $15.8 billion in revenue, $2.8 billion of operating pre-tax income, and $2.43 operating diluted earnings per share. Our 4% revenue growth at constant currency combined with greater than 200 basis points of operating pre-tax margin expansion drove 17% operating pre-tax income growth and 11% operating diluted earnings per share growth, highlighting our strong execution. And through the first-half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow generation is the strongest first half level we have reported in many years. We are pleased with these results, exceeding our expectations for revenue, profitability, free cash flow, and earnings per share. Revenue growth was led by software and infrastructure. It is clear that our investments in innovation are yielding results and driving strong organic growth across these segments. Software grew by 8% with solid growth across hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing and strong transactional performance. Infrastructure had great performance, up 3%, delivering growth across IBM Z and distributed infrastructure. Consulting was up 2% and continued to be impacted by a pullback in discretionary spending. Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 190 basis points and operating pre-tax margin by 220 basis points over the last year, inclusive of about a 30 basis-point currency headwind to pre-tax margin. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. Driving productivity is core to our operating and financial model. This includes enabling a higher-value workforce through automation and AI, streamlining our supply-chain, aligning our teams by workflow and reducing our real-estate footprint. These actions allow for continued investment in innovation with R&D up 9% in the first-half. This includes investments in both AI and hybrid cloud as well as infrastructure ahead of our Nexi program in 2025, which we expect to accelerate our organic growth profile over time. Our results this quarter reflect broad-based growth and the strength in the fundamentals of our business with revenue up about $300 million, operating pre-tax income up about $400 million, adjusted EBITDA up more than $350 million and free cash flow up about $500 million. For the first-half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this first-half growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up about $550 million year-over-year and timing of CapEx. We are a few points ahead of our two-year average attainment levels through the first-half. In terms of cash uses, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash of $16 billion, up $2.5 billion since year-end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the second-quarter was flat with year-end 2023 at $56.5 billion, including $11.1 billion from our financing business. Putting this all together, our business fundamentals remain solid with continued revenue growth, margin expansion, cash generation, and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business. Turning to the segments. Software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing grew as clients leverage the capabilities of our AI and hybrid cloud platforms. This performance reflects the investments we've been making in software, both organically, which drove more than 6 points of the growth as well as acquisitions. As mentioned in January, the software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, the combination of innovation, recurring revenue, and transaction processing, as well as acquisitions. Let me spend a minute on each of these elements. In Red Hat, annual bookings growth accelerated to over 20% this quarter. Within that performance, OpenShift annual bookings were up over 40% and RHEL and Ansible growth was double digit. The strength reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions, including app modernization, management automation, generative AI and virtualization. In a subscription-based business, the majority of revenue is under contract for the next two quarters. Think of it as our CRPO for the next six months. This metric is growing in the mid-teens and accelerating more than 5 points versus the first-half of the year. We continue to bring new innovation to our portfolio and it's contributing nicely to our software performance. Our new innovation includes generative AI offerings like watsonx, our AI middleware, watsonx Assistants, the recently-announced IBM Concert and others, which contributed about $0.5 billion to our AI book of business inception to-date. And we delivered good growth across our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of the annual software revenue. This is evident in hybrid platform and solutions, where our ARR is now $14.1 billion and up 9% since last year. Transaction processing delivered 13% revenue growth. This performance demonstrates the innovation and value of our mission-critical hardware stack across IBM Z, power and storage. The combination of growing demand for capacity, good client renewals, and strong large deal performance fueled our results. And notably, our new generative AI portfolio innovation, watsonx Code Assistant for Z is resonating well with clients. Together, these dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue performance this quarter also benefited from our focused M&A strategy, including synergies realized across the portfolio. This included the recent Apptio acquisition. Less than 12 months since closing, we have accelerated annual bookings and are seeing an uptick in ARR growth already in the mid-teens. The synergy between Apptio's FinOps offerings and our broader automation portfolio helps clients manage, optimize and automate technology spending decisions. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG and expect the HashiCorp acquisition to close by year end. Looking at software profit, gross profit margin expanded and segment profit was up over 350 basis points year-to-year, with the latter reflecting operating leverage driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter. Our consulting revenue was up 2%, consistent with last quarter and largely reflecting organic growth. In April, we discussed that we were seeing solid demand for our large transformational offerings as clients continue to prioritize driving productivity with AI and analytics. At the same time, we saw a pullback on discretionary projects as clients prioritize their spending. The second quarter buying behavior played out much in the same way. Signings for the quarter were $5.7 billion, driven by solid demand for large engagements across finance and supply-chain transformation, cloud modernization, and application development. This contributed to backlog growth of 5% year-over-year and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill remaining over 1.15. Meanwhile, continued discretionary spending constraints impacted our small engagement performance and backlog realization in the quarter. As Arvind mentioned, our book of business in generative AI inception-to-date is greater than $2 billion and about three quarters of it represents consulting signings with strong quarter-over-quarter momentum. Our extensive industry and domain expertise has placed us in an early leadership role, which is crucial at the onset of a technology shift. IBM has both technology and consulting, which is a unique and powerful combination to help clients navigate this technology transition. Similar to previous technology shifts such as the advent of the Internet, globalization, and cloud computing, generative AI is driving the next wave of growth. In a human capital-based business, signings represents clients reprioritizing spend on this technology transition, while there is some potential for lift as the total addressable market expands. We are delivering value in two ways. First, partnering with our clients to design and scale AI solutions, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners or a combination. Second, we are developing new ways of working, driving productivity and improving delivery, all with our Consulting Advantage platform. In summary, GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to grow revenues, cut costs and change the ways they work, creating a significant opportunity for us. We are seeing this already as IBM is the strategic partner of choice for clients using this technology, including WPP, Elevance Health, and the UK's Department of Work and Pensions. Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 6%, led by finance and supply-chain transformations. Data transformation also contributed to growth. In Technology Consulting, revenue was up 1%. Growth was driven by application modernization services. Application operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. Looking at consulting profit, we expanded gross profit margins by 40 basis points, driven by productivity and pricing actions we have taken. Segment profit margin was modestly down, reflecting continued labor inflation and currency. Moving to infrastructure, revenue was up 3%. We're capitalizing on the strong and broad-based demand for our hardware platforms, especially IBM Z. Within hybrid infrastructure, IBM Z revenue was up 8% this quarter. We're now more than two years into the z16 cycle and the revenue performance continues to outperform prior cycles. Our clients are facing increasing demands for workloads given rapid business expansion, the complex regulatory environment and increasing cybersecurity threats and attacks. IBM Z addresses these needs with a combination of cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe security, energy efficiency, and strong reliability and scalability. Increasing workloads translates to more Z capacity or MIPS, which are up about threefold over the last few cycles. IBM Z remains an enduring platform for mission-critical workloads, driving both hardware and related software, storage and services adoption. In distributed infrastructure, revenue grew 5%, driven by strength in both power and storage. Power growth was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10 led by SAP HANA. Storage delivered growth again this quarter, including growth in high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and solutions tailored to protect, manage, and access data for scaling generative AI. Looking at infrastructure profit, we delivered solid gross profit margin expansion and segment profit accelerated quarter-to-quarter to the high-teens. Segment profit margin was down 230 basis points in the quarter, reflecting key investments we're making in the business across areas like AI, hybrid cloud and quantum, and almost a point of impact due to currency. Now, let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our performance in the first half with revenue growth reflecting the investments we've been making both organically as well as acquisitions. Our focus on execution and the strength in the fundamentals of our business resulted in strong performance in the quarter across revenue, margin expansion, and growth in profitability and earnings. Looking to the full-year 2024, we are holding our view on revenue. We see full-year constant-currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end. For free cash flow, given the strength in our performance in the first half, we feel confident in raising our expectations to greater than $12 billion, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. This also includes a modest contribution resulting from the Palo Alto QRadar transaction, largely offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. We continue to expect the QRadar transaction to close by the end of the third quarter. On the segments, in Software, we had solid first-half performance, up more than 7%. This performance reflects strength in our recurring revenue base and early traction in GenAI. With this performance, we are raising our view of growth in software to high-single-digits for the year. And given ongoing productivity initiatives and operating leverage, we now expect software segment profit margin to expand by over a point. In Consulting, given the continued pressure we have seen on spending related to discretionary projects, we now expect low-single-digit growth for the year and segment profit margin to expand by about half a point. And given the strength in infrastructure in the first-half, we now expect it to be about neutral for the year with segment profit margin in the mid-teens to high-teens. With these segment dynamics, we are raising our expectations of operating pre-tax margin expansion to over a half a point year to year. And we are maintaining our view of operating tax rate in the mid-teens range, consistent with last year. On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 100 basis-point to 200 basis-point impact to revenue growth for the year. For the third quarter, we see revenue growth consistent with the full-year. For profit, we expect our net income SKU through the third quarter to remain a couple of points ahead of the prior year, driven by the strength of our business. And again, we expect the gain of the Palo Alto QRadar transaction will be offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. In closing, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and for the first-half, driving confidence in our updated expectations. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit and grow free cash flow for the year. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started.\nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part questions. Operator, let's please open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll begin the question-and-answer session of the conference. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please state your question.\nWamsi Mohan: Yes, thank you so much. Your long-term model on transaction processing is low-single-digit and you just posted a very strong quarter with 13% growth in the quarter. How should we think about the trajectory of that in 2024 and maybe in 2025? I know, Jim, you noted a few different things, including solid client renewals and some strong large deal performance. Was there anything very episodic or unusually large within that mix as well? Thank you so much.\nJim Kavanaugh: Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question overall. Very important. You know, if you take a step back, you know, we continue to be very pleased with our transaction processing performance overall. You know, if you dial back to when we laid out our mid-term model, we said we converted this to a growth vector, low-single-digit overall. And if you look at the last couple of years, we've been averaging mid-single-digit or better overall. We shifted this now to a growth contributor. And why is that important? One, high source of profit and cash, the fund investment flexibility; and two, it provides a very solid incumbency base for the IBM or multiplier effect. But if you take a look at it, we are capitalizing on the strength that we've seen over the last three programs of our mainframe cycle. It's really instantiating the enduring value of that platform. Our MIPS over the last few programs are up three times from an installed perspective and over 80% of our clients are growing MIPS on the mainframe. I think that was a very different picture when you dial back five, seven years ago already. So, we've taken that portfolio. We've invested now significantly, which I'll come to around watsonx Code Assistant for Z, but we've taken that from a down mid-single-digit portfolio to now capitalizing on the stack economics of our mainframe, execution and move that to low-single-digit. Now for the year, as you heard, we are taking up our guidance just given the strength of first half to mid-single-digit. You know, when you get into 2025, we'll talk about our guidance going forward, but we feel very confident that we can continue growing this and that's why we're investing in bringing out new capabilities like watsonx Code Assistant for Z, which is resonating extremely well.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein.\nToni Sacconaghi: Yes, thank you for taking the question. I'm wondering maybe you can discuss how you think about AI signings and whether you believe they're really incremental or just a shift in client spending? And part of the reason I asked the question is, if I -- you know, it looks like your AI book of business was up about $1 billion sequentially. You're saying three quarters of that is Consulting, so it's $700-plus million in Consulting signings in the quarter. If I take that out, your book-to-bill and the rest of your business is actually down. And despite the strong signings, you're lowering your Consulting expectations for the year. So, I'm just wondering, do you think AI investments in Consulting are a shift in spending? Or do you think they're accretive? Or do you actually think they could even be cannibalistic to Consulting spend and more broadly IT spend?\nArvind Krishna: Yes. So Toni, let me start and then Jim will add more color on this topic. First, it's a great question and you laid out some of the dynamics that were going on in there. If we just step back and just look at our comments on the macroeconomic environment, we kind of stated that there is discretionary spend pressure in Consulting. When you do have that pressure, but there is a demand for AI, I would look you in the eye and say, probably the bulk of that demand, not all but the bulk is indeed a shift from other areas of Consulting. We don't actually believe it's cannibalistic to the point you're pointing out. Now, as time goes on and as people move from early experimentation and proving out the value to wanting to scale and really get the full benefits of generative AI, we do actually believe at that point, even for consulting, these will turn into accretive and additive, but we are still some time away from when that will happen. So, that is just to give you some color and acknowledging that the bulk, but not all is a shift. Jim?\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Thanks Toni for the question. Just building on what Arvind said. I mean, first of all, we're very pleased with the early momentum that we've gotten with our book of business around GenAI, both on the technology side with our watsonx platform and now with our open innovation strategy around RHEL AI, OpenShift Granite model's InstructLab, etc. But let's just deep -- dive a little deeper into your question about Consulting, because I think when you look at Consulting, first of all, why is it so important right now in a early part of a cycle? It's important because it's got to establish IBM Consulting as the strategic provider of choice for enterprises as they're going through what we'd like to call digital transformation 2.0 with GenAI. Everyone is looking for who is going to be their strategic provider and partner. And I think $1.5 billion over $1.5 billion book of business in the first 12 months, which by the way is in excess of the ramp we saw play out with hybrid cloud and Red Hat, we're off to a pretty good start. Now, to Arvind's point, you know, in every technology shift, very different dynamics between a Human Capital based business and a product IP business. Human Capital based business, we do see and we expected clients will shift and reprioritize spending. They're doing that now as they're driving large enterprise transformation projects, which is what our portfolio has been able to capture, and that's why you see nice acceleration in growth in our backlog up healthy at 5%. But to Arvind's point, we do think once you get through the early cycle, this is an incremental expansion of TAM that drives a long-tail growth vector over time that has multiplier opportunities for us. So when you look at our consulting book of business, let's dive into the sub-segments, you see business transformation services, which a lot of the GenAI plays out too early right now. That is how do you transform the way you operate HR, finance, supply-chain. We've doubled and accelerated our growth quarter-to-quarter. What you're seeing is a reprioritization and dynamic spending decisions by clients because our AO, where we have a lot of short-term discretionary staff augmentation work, there's a lot of trade-offs between those two. So, it's important for us strategically with our client base, but I think you see how it plays out. Now, just to wrap up the full picture, Software, I think is fundamentally different. Our software book of business now $0.5 billion through the first 12 months. I think inception-to-date right now, we're about two-thirds of subscription, SaaS, one-third perpetual. I think that's contributing nicely about a point of growth. And by the way, that's one of the two components of why we took our software up for the year. So, I think that's predominantly all lift.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI.\nAmit Daryanani: Thanks for taking my question. I guess, you know, my question is really on the Consulting side. And when I think about this business growing low-single-digits for '24, if I take out some of the M&A contribution, also some of the revenues from the AI book of bill -- book of business that you have at $1.5 billion, is it fair to think that maybe the non-AI Consulting piece actually gets worse in H2 versus H1 for you? If you just talk about the puts and takes on the back half consulting expectations versus front half, that would be really helpful. And then, you know, I'm curious, if you talk to your customers, what is your sense on the duration of this weakness in Consulting and when do you think it has to come back? Thank you.\nArvind Krishna: Hi. So Amit, let me just start and maybe address the second part of your question first and then. I actually do not believe there's any secular macro trend around weakness. I think that this is temporal based on a number of factors we have. The geopolitical uncertainty has gone longer than most people expected and that weighs into people's heads about what that might happen. And specifically, the war in Europe as well as the war in the Middle-East. Second, inflation has gone longer than people expected, which has the unfortunate consequence of higher interest rates and that begins to bear on people. If I look at those two altogether and that then at the moment you have higher interest rates and inflation, you have wage inflation, which does impact the bottom-line of our clients. You put all of that into perspective and is this going to go on for another six months? Likely. Is it going to go on for another year? I'm not so sure, but we got to get through the second half to be able to go there. So, that is why we are optimistic about the medium-term and long-term vector on Consulting. And as Jim answered in the prior question, we do see that this is going to become a tailwind over time, at least for us. Now, in the short-term for the next six months, we do think it holds up a little bit. In terms of answering the specifics and sort of decomposing some of the numbers that you laid out in the first part of your question, I'm going to turn that over to Jim.\nJim Kavanaugh: Yes. Thanks Arvind and thanks Amit for the question overall. You know, let's put this in perspective, right? You go back 90 days ago, how did we see the year kind of playing out with Consulting? We said at that point in time, we had backlog growing nicely mid-single-digit, albeit we did talk about durations going up because large scale transformations were really where the spend was moving to. But we had a solid book-to-bill trailing 12 months over 1.15. We had GenAI momentum that was going to continue throughout the year early in the cycle. We had strategic partnerships, Red Hat growth profile, and we had future acquisitions as we're going to continue to be opportunistic around our M&A criteria and the synergistic value of how consulting plays to our portfolio. If you look right now, 90 days later, as we look to the second-half, many of those are still playing out. You got GenAI, which arguably were above our own expectations, right now doubling, by the way, in Consulting, our GenAI book of business quarter-to-quarter, strategic partnerships, especially hyperscalers, Red Hat still growing nicely. What you're seeing, you know, at the end of the day, those are large scale transformations, lower yield, that's why Arvind and I are saying these are longer-term growth vectors and tails that will play out into '25, '26 and beyond as we get that strategic provider of choice. But in the interim, what you're seeing is that spending reprioritization around short-term discretionary that I think, you know, everyone in the industry is talking about. We're all dealing with this. The key is we have to win that strategic provider of choice in GenAI. And I would argue we're off to a great start. You look at competitor numbers overall, we got $1.5 billion over $1.5 billion book of business doubling quarter-to-quarter right now. I think we're in pretty good shape. That's what we're focused on because that will provide the future revenue multiplier effect as we move forward.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs.\nJim Schneider: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I could just ask on different topic for a second. Can you maybe talk about the environment you see right now for M&A and your intention to continue to drive through acquisitions? And do you believe you have sufficient scale in open-source and DevOps software in particular? And can you maybe comment on the attractiveness of multiples in the public market today relative to the private market?\nArvind Krishna: Hey, Jim, great question and thank you for asking this. Look, on overall M&A, I just want to begin with that our strategy has not changed. We are -- we are disciplined and we are focused. By focused, I mean we stick to the areas that we are investing in hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. And by discipline, I mean it has to be not just aligned to our strategy, but we expect synergy from the acquisition, especially the multiples are higher as you pointed out and it has to be accretive to free cash flow if it's larger, definitely within two years at the outer end of the range. So having said that, if I look at it right now, we have HashiCorp out there. So, we got to get through that. We expect that to happen in the second-half of this year. We just finished StreamSets and webMethods and we've done a couple of smaller ones in the Consulting space and in other technology tuck-ins.\nJim Schneider: All right.\nArvind Krishna: What do we see going into this space? Our valuations rich, they're reasonably rich. They're not outrageous, I would say, like they had become in parts of late 2020 and 2021. So, I would say that they are more reasonable than then, but they're richer than they were about 18 months ago. There are different dynamics in both the public and the private markets. Public markets are quite variable. I mean, as we can see, some of the multiples and if you look at multiple to revenue, which is not a great metric, let me just acknowledge that, but it is one that's out there. If you look at six, seven, eight, maybe nine or 10 times, we can see our way there for a large deal as long as we have sufficient synergy. Now, for very small deals, that's not even a fair multiple. Very small deals are all about technology and people. In the private markets, we were very pleased with what we got done on StreamSets and webMethods. I would call that a private market deal, not a public market deal. And there, I think it all depends upon what's the property, what is its growth profile, what is the attractiveness of it to the seller versus the buyer, in this case us, all of that play into those multiples. I do expect that on the private side, valuations will be slightly less, but then the risk of going public or some other exit is also taken away. And in some sense, you get a discount for taking that risk off the table. For people who are venture-backed, that's different. They are looking at IPO versus a strategic exit and those are different multiples. But putting all of that together, we remain in the market and M&A is an important part of our growth methodology. We maintain a strong balance sheet for that purpose and we've kind of been clear of that. All that said, this year, we got a big one coming. So, we want to wait and get that done because part of the discipline is also making sure that we kind of digest them at the right rate and pace and put them into our global go-to-market distribution engine.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let's take the next question.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please state your question.\nBen Reitzes: Yes. Hey, thank you. Appreciate it. Jim, I wanted to -- and Arvind, I wanted to see, you know, if the -- it sounds like the margin progress is sustainable for the year. So while I appreciate that you guide to free cash flow and you've raised it a little bit, do you anticipate us being able to flow through the $0.25 of upside on the EPS line? And you know, can -- does that mean earnings is sustainable in the back half? And then I was just wondering if you have any more info on HashiCorp, yes, in terms of the revenue contribution, Street was looking for about $750 million in revenue next year. And on the dilution, there's -- there should be a loss of around $0.30 in interest income. So, just wondering if you have any further views on the net effect to 2025 on that deal. Thanks so much, guys.\nJim Kavanaugh: Hey, Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Very good question overall. But let's take a step back on your first part of the question around free cash flow. Yes, we're very pleased with the start of the year. Free cash flow of $4.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year-to-year, 4 points above historical attainment. It's our largest first half free cash flow generation as far back as I can go and count. So, we're off to a pretty good start and that gives us the confidence overall of how we're positioning second-half. But the second half and why we took the guidance up is entirely driven by the strength of the fundamentals of our business and flowing through the adjusted EBITDA overachievement. So, read that, although we don't guide on EPS, the strong overachievement of the $0.25 of EPS, we're flowing that through to adjusted EBITDA and that flows through to our guide take-up on free cash flow. The rest of the free cash flow dynamics we've been talking about all year long around, yes, we got benefits of change in retirement plans and cash tax that's going to be a headwind and other balance sheet items, none of that changes. One thing I will bring up and we said in the prepared remarks, but just so there's absolute clarity, we do expect to close the Palo Alto transaction here in the third quarter around certain assets of our QRadar business that will obviously generate a gain. We're excited about the new strategic relationship between our two great companies overall, but we will take structural actions to offset that gain to address stranded cost. And oh, by the way, to your second part of your question, to accelerate our productivity initiatives in 2025, so you get the HashiCorp. First of all, the strategic transaction stands on its -- on its own. Arvind went through our M&A criteria. I think there's a very compelling strategic fit around an end-to-end leadership hybrid cloud platform. There's a lot of synergistic value both on product technology and go-to-market, but there's a very attractive financial profile that we talked about 90 days ago, higher revenue growth profile, adjusted EBITDA accretive in 12 months, free cash flow accretive to Arvind's point by two years. And we do see potential significant near-term cost in operating synergies that lead to about a 30% to 40% free cash flow margin business over a handful of years. Now, when you look at dilution, we understand dilution. I mean, M&A has been an integral part of our financial model for decades. So, underneath that, we understand the purchase growth of those transactions, the synergies of those transactions, the balance sheet capital structure implications of those. And with all that said, our model is to grow mid-single-digit revenue and grow operating leverage so we grow free cash flow quicker than revenue. We don't see that changing in 2025. We see growth profiles around revenue, around operating leverage and around free cash flow overall. And that speaks to the diversity or diversification, I should say, of our business model around productivity. We entered the year, raised it to $3 billion. We're getting out ahead of that again and you see that play out in our margins through the first-half, what, up 180 basis points on pre-tax. So, we've got many levers to deal with this overall. We know how to handle it.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let's take the next question.\nOperator: The next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\nErik Woodring: Hey guys, thanks so much for taking my question. Arvind or Jim, I'd love if you could just dig into the Red Hat business a bit more. You know, over the last few quarters, you've talked about some very healthy bookings growth numbers ranging anywhere between, call it, 15% and 20%. But we did see growth obviously decelerate by about a point this quarter despite, you know, expectations that it would be flat to maybe increasing for the rest of the year. So, can you just kind of double click on exactly what you're seeing with the Red Hat business today? What's kind of the offset to the strong bookings numbers? And how should we think about Red Hat growth now in constant currency for 2024? Thanks so much.\nArvind Krishna: Great question, Erik. So, let's just look at the Red Hat business in terms of how the dynamics function between our clients and ourselves. So, clients come in and create demand, we fulfill that. That shows up as bookings, not as revenue because the Red Hat business model is a pure consumption business model. Clients pay for what they're consuming and so the bookings then play out. Now, those bookings are a signal of further demand and typically they're anywhere from one-year to three-year worth of revenue that the client is pre-committing to. So, when we enter a year, about half the revenue, we can look at the bookings of the previous year and say that that gives us. The other half has to come over the quarter. Now that we have a year, not longer, but a year of the double-digit demand that you're talking about, if I remember right, it was 14%, 17%, 14%, 20% in terms of those demands. Now that full-year is there, that points to that for the portion that we can see, and as we get into a quarter, it climbs up from that 50% to 60% to 70% to 80% and Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, what he called CRPO or the revenue performance obligations, we see those sitting around mid-teens for the second half of the year to answer your question. Now, if that's about 80% and that will translate into low double digit is what we can look at and feel quite comfortable on. By the way, we see these early signs of the demand continue into this quarter and likely the half, which means that we expect to continue now in the low double digits going forward. So, I hope that that gives you a sense. But I'm also excited by the underlying product capabilities. We see OpenShift, which is extremely important. It plays into containerization, it plays into virtualization. It's an important element of how our clients exercise hybrid. It has been growing and the demand there grew again at about 40% this past quarter. But we also saw acceleration in Linux and enhanceable where both of those demand vectors grown to the low double-digits. That given the size of the Linux business is very good news for us going forward. So, I hope that that gives you some color on those pieces. And a vector that we have not talked about that will play, but probably into '25 and '26, we are very excited by our two open-source AI projects inside the Red Ad business, our RHEL AI as well as OpenShift AI. And as people begin to deploy at scale, but not only on public cloud, but also on-premise, leveraging their hybrid environment, we expect that both of those will also contribute into the Red Hat business, but that will take more time.\nOlympia McNerney: Operator, let's take one last question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets.\nMatt Swanson: Thank you. Yes. Arvind, if we could pick up right where you left off there. Can you just give us a little more color on the decision to open up the Granite models and the code base? And then really kind of what you're seeing in the market that makes you feel like taking maybe a more developer-focused approach to those? I think as you put it, fit-for-purpose models, is the right long-term strategy?\nArvind Krishna: So Matt, thank you for asking that question. And there was actually a question on developers before also. So, I'm sorry we didn't get to it fully. We'll get to it now in this question. Look, the whole question comes down to, there was a thesis out there about a year and a half ago that maybe one, maybe two extremely large models are going to run away with the bulk of the market share. We always felt that was both technically and economically infeasible. And I'll describe why. If you run an extremely large model on public clouds, the model by its nature is going to be expensive because a very large model needs a lot more compute, a lot more network, a lot more storage, a lot more memory, and we can see some of those dynamics play out. If you can drop the model size, you can drop all of that by 90%. I would actually tell you 99% reduction in the compute and memory and network costs, but let's call it 90% just for the sake of argument. So if you are running a -- like one of our clients was describing to me, they run a couple of billion transactions through their internal systems each day. If they had to go service those out to a large public cloud, the bill per day would have come back to be a couple of $100 million. You multiply that by 250, that's kind of an infeasible cost. If you can drop it by 90%, you're now bringing it down to the $10 million to $20 million a day. If you can actually run it using some of our Red Hat technologies on-premise, you can drop it by another 50%. You're not talking 5% to 10%. For what it can do, that is a very attractive proposition. So, now getting back to the models. If you have no idea what you're going to do, if you have no idea what you might be looking for, you go to a very large model because it contains all the possible elements. If you have a sense of what you need to do, I need to summarize emails. You need an English-language model if you're sitting here in the United States. If you are going to go change your Java or C++ or Python programmers to be more productive, you don't need a model that can write poetry and draw images. You need a model that understands programming languages. So, we are very, very proud of what our team has done. We can produce models that can do these things. So, these are two distinct models, one for programming, one for business language. They are one-tenth or less than that of the size of the extremely large models. But you can look on the leader boards, they perform quite as well as the largest models. So, that is kind of what our strategy is. However, if our clients want other models, we are also happy to work with other models and we have had that perspective. So, why open-source since that is part of your question? Why open-source is because often we find that clients want to increase the model's efficacy by adding their own unique language. People might want to write emails in a certain way. They might want to program in a certain way. They like comments in a certain style. I call that refining the model. We have a technique called InstructLab, but then clients get concerned. Wait, if I add my data, I don't want to give that away and back into a more public format. Can I keep that to myself? So, open sourcing our models under the Apache license gives our clients the freedom that what they add onto our underlying open model, they can keep to themselves. Now, to the developer point, putting all of that machinery into Red Hat Linux now gives us an avenue to open it up to developers as they can go experiment and play. By the way, I will turn around and tell you that for a developer who's not running production, who's just playing with things like all people do it. On a MacBook, you can begin to play around with models that are in the low tens of billions of parameters. That's a massive market that opens up. They get the freedom and flexibility that they don't have to give it back to us unless they want to. I am not actually concerned about this gives away the IP, as we have found through whether it's Red Hat Linux or whether other people have found through Mongo or other people have found through Hadoop, enterprises do look for and the last few days have certainly shown us, people look for patching, people look for security, people look for backward compatibility. There's a lot of enterprise reasons why people will still do business with us. But the open-source nature of what you asked, I'm so glad you did, allows us to expand that market into the millions of developers who do run Linux on their own machines or their corporate machines or their laptops and they can go experiment, add their innovation and either give it back to the community or actually reserve it for their enterprise. So, that's how we kind of tap into the whole developer ecosystem. So, let me now wrap up the call. In the second quarter of 2024, we executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation. We saw strong performance across our portfolio. We are excited about our early traction in generative AI. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year. Thank you all.\nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Arvind. Operator, let me turn it back to you to close out the call.\nOperator: Thank you for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Jim Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thanks, Arvind. In the second quarter, we delivered $15.8 billion in revenue, $2.8 billion of operating pre-tax income, and $2.43 operating diluted earnings per share. Our 4% revenue growth at constant currency combined with greater than 200 basis points of operating pre-tax margin expansion drove 17% operating pre-tax income growth and 11% operating diluted earnings per share growth, highlighting our strong execution. And through the first-half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow. Our free cash flow generation is the strongest first half level we have reported in many years. We are pleased with these results, exceeding our expectations for revenue, profitability, free cash flow, and earnings per share. Revenue growth was led by software and infrastructure. It is clear that our investments in innovation are yielding results and driving strong organic growth across these segments. Software grew by 8% with solid growth across hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing and strong transactional performance. Infrastructure had great performance, up 3%, delivering growth across IBM Z and distributed infrastructure. Consulting was up 2% and continued to be impacted by a pullback in discretionary spending. Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 190 basis points and operating pre-tax margin by 220 basis points over the last year, inclusive of about a 30 basis-point currency headwind to pre-tax margin. Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. Driving productivity is core to our operating and financial model. This includes enabling a higher-value workforce through automation and AI, streamlining our supply-chain, aligning our teams by workflow and reducing our real-estate footprint. These actions allow for continued investment in innovation with R&D up 9% in the first-half. This includes investments in both AI and hybrid cloud as well as infrastructure ahead of our Nexi program in 2025, which we expect to accelerate our organic growth profile over time. Our results this quarter reflect broad-based growth and the strength in the fundamentals of our business with revenue up about $300 million, operating pre-tax income up about $400 million, adjusted EBITDA up more than $350 million and free cash flow up about $500 million. For the first-half, we generated $4.5 billion of free cash flow, up $1.1 billion year-over-year. The largest driver of this first-half growth comes from adjusted EBITDA, up about $550 million year-over-year and timing of CapEx. We are a few points ahead of our two-year average attainment levels through the first-half. In terms of cash uses, we returned $3.1 billion to shareholders in the first half in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash of $16 billion, up $2.5 billion since year-end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the second-quarter was flat with year-end 2023 at $56.5 billion, including $11.1 billion from our financing business. Putting this all together, our business fundamentals remain solid with continued revenue growth, margin expansion, cash generation, and a strong balance sheet with financial flexibility to support our business. Turning to the segments. Software revenue growth accelerated to 8% this quarter. Both hybrid platform and solutions and transaction processing grew as clients leverage the capabilities of our AI and hybrid cloud platforms. This performance reflects the investments we've been making in software, both organically, which drove more than 6 points of the growth as well as acquisitions. As mentioned in January, the software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, the combination of innovation, recurring revenue, and transaction processing, as well as acquisitions. Let me spend a minute on each of these elements. In Red Hat, annual bookings growth accelerated to over 20% this quarter. Within that performance, OpenShift annual bookings were up over 40% and RHEL and Ansible growth was double digit. The strength reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions, including app modernization, management automation, generative AI and virtualization. In a subscription-based business, the majority of revenue is under contract for the next two quarters. Think of it as our CRPO for the next six months. This metric is growing in the mid-teens and accelerating more than 5 points versus the first-half of the year. We continue to bring new innovation to our portfolio and it's contributing nicely to our software performance. Our new innovation includes generative AI offerings like watsonx, our AI middleware, watsonx Assistants, the recently-announced IBM Concert and others, which contributed about $0.5 billion to our AI book of business inception to-date. And we delivered good growth across our recurring revenue base, which is about 80% of the annual software revenue. This is evident in hybrid platform and solutions, where our ARR is now $14.1 billion and up 9% since last year. Transaction processing delivered 13% revenue growth. This performance demonstrates the innovation and value of our mission-critical hardware stack across IBM Z, power and storage. The combination of growing demand for capacity, good client renewals, and strong large deal performance fueled our results. And notably, our new generative AI portfolio innovation, watsonx Code Assistant for Z is resonating well with clients. Together, these dynamics contributed to both recurring and transactional software revenue growth again this quarter. Revenue performance this quarter also benefited from our focused M&A strategy, including synergies realized across the portfolio. This included the recent Apptio acquisition. Less than 12 months since closing, we have accelerated annual bookings and are seeing an uptick in ARR growth already in the mid-teens. The synergy between Apptio's FinOps offerings and our broader automation portfolio helps clients manage, optimize and automate technology spending decisions. Earlier this month, we completed the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG and expect the HashiCorp acquisition to close by year end. Looking at software profit, gross profit margin expanded and segment profit was up over 350 basis points year-to-year, with the latter reflecting operating leverage driven by our revenue scale and mix this quarter. Our consulting revenue was up 2%, consistent with last quarter and largely reflecting organic growth. In April, we discussed that we were seeing solid demand for our large transformational offerings as clients continue to prioritize driving productivity with AI and analytics. At the same time, we saw a pullback on discretionary projects as clients prioritize their spending. The second quarter buying behavior played out much in the same way. Signings for the quarter were $5.7 billion, driven by solid demand for large engagements across finance and supply-chain transformation, cloud modernization, and application development. This contributed to backlog growth of 5% year-over-year and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill remaining over 1.15. Meanwhile, continued discretionary spending constraints impacted our small engagement performance and backlog realization in the quarter. As Arvind mentioned, our book of business in generative AI inception-to-date is greater than $2 billion and about three quarters of it represents consulting signings with strong quarter-over-quarter momentum. Our extensive industry and domain expertise has placed us in an early leadership role, which is crucial at the onset of a technology shift. IBM has both technology and consulting, which is a unique and powerful combination to help clients navigate this technology transition. Similar to previous technology shifts such as the advent of the Internet, globalization, and cloud computing, generative AI is driving the next wave of growth. In a human capital-based business, signings represents clients reprioritizing spend on this technology transition, while there is some potential for lift as the total addressable market expands. We are delivering value in two ways. First, partnering with our clients to design and scale AI solutions, whether that be leveraging AI capabilities of IBM, our partners or a combination. Second, we are developing new ways of working, driving productivity and improving delivery, all with our Consulting Advantage platform. In summary, GenAI is acting as a catalyst for companies to grow revenues, cut costs and change the ways they work, creating a significant opportunity for us. We are seeing this already as IBM is the strategic partner of choice for clients using this technology, including WPP, Elevance Health, and the UK's Department of Work and Pensions. Turning to our lines of business. Business transformation revenue grew 6%, led by finance and supply-chain transformations. Data transformation also contributed to growth. In Technology Consulting, revenue was up 1%. Growth was driven by application modernization services. Application operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. Looking at consulting profit, we expanded gross profit margins by 40 basis points, driven by productivity and pricing actions we have taken. Segment profit margin was modestly down, reflecting continued labor inflation and currency. Moving to infrastructure, revenue was up 3%. We're capitalizing on the strong and broad-based demand for our hardware platforms, especially IBM Z. Within hybrid infrastructure, IBM Z revenue was up 8% this quarter. We're now more than two years into the z16 cycle and the revenue performance continues to outperform prior cycles. Our clients are facing increasing demands for workloads given rapid business expansion, the complex regulatory environment and increasing cybersecurity threats and attacks. IBM Z addresses these needs with a combination of cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe security, energy efficiency, and strong reliability and scalability. Increasing workloads translates to more Z capacity or MIPS, which are up about threefold over the last few cycles. IBM Z remains an enduring platform for mission-critical workloads, driving both hardware and related software, storage and services adoption. In distributed infrastructure, revenue grew 5%, driven by strength in both power and storage. Power growth was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads on Power10 led by SAP HANA. Storage delivered growth again this quarter, including growth in high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and solutions tailored to protect, manage, and access data for scaling generative AI. Looking at infrastructure profit, we delivered solid gross profit margin expansion and segment profit accelerated quarter-to-quarter to the high-teens. Segment profit margin was down 230 basis points in the quarter, reflecting key investments we're making in the business across areas like AI, hybrid cloud and quantum, and almost a point of impact due to currency. Now, let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. We feel good about our performance in the first half with revenue growth reflecting the investments we've been making both organically as well as acquisitions. Our focus on execution and the strength in the fundamentals of our business resulted in strong performance in the quarter across revenue, margin expansion, and growth in profitability and earnings. Looking to the full-year 2024, we are holding our view on revenue. We see full-year constant-currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end. For free cash flow, given the strength in our performance in the first half, we feel confident in raising our expectations to greater than $12 billion, driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. This also includes a modest contribution resulting from the Palo Alto QRadar transaction, largely offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. We continue to expect the QRadar transaction to close by the end of the third quarter. On the segments, in Software, we had solid first-half performance, up more than 7%. This performance reflects strength in our recurring revenue base and early traction in GenAI. With this performance, we are raising our view of growth in software to high-single-digits for the year. And given ongoing productivity initiatives and operating leverage, we now expect software segment profit margin to expand by over a point. In Consulting, given the continued pressure we have seen on spending related to discretionary projects, we now expect low-single-digit growth for the year and segment profit margin to expand by about half a point. And given the strength in infrastructure in the first-half, we now expect it to be about neutral for the year with segment profit margin in the mid-teens to high-teens. With these segment dynamics, we are raising our expectations of operating pre-tax margin expansion to over a half a point year to year. And we are maintaining our view of operating tax rate in the mid-teens range, consistent with last year. On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 100 basis-point to 200 basis-point impact to revenue growth for the year. For the third quarter, we see revenue growth consistent with the full-year. For profit, we expect our net income SKU through the third quarter to remain a couple of points ahead of the prior year, driven by the strength of our business. And again, we expect the gain of the Palo Alto QRadar transaction will be offset by related structural actions to address stranded costs. In closing, we are pleased with our performance this quarter and for the first-half, driving confidence in our updated expectations. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit and grow free cash flow for the year. Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started. Thanks, Wamsi. I appreciate the question overall. Very important. You know, if you take a step back, you know, we continue to be very pleased with our transaction processing performance overall. You know, if you dial back to when we laid out our mid-term model, we said we converted this to a growth vector, low-single-digit overall. And if you look at the last couple of years, we've been averaging mid-single-digit or better overall. We shifted this now to a growth contributor. And why is that important? One, high source of profit and cash, the fund investment flexibility; and two, it provides a very solid incumbency base for the IBM or multiplier effect. But if you take a look at it, we are capitalizing on the strength that we've seen over the last three programs of our mainframe cycle. It's really instantiating the enduring value of that platform. Our MIPS over the last few programs are up three times from an installed perspective and over 80% of our clients are growing MIPS on the mainframe. I think that was a very different picture when you dial back five, seven years ago already. So, we've taken that portfolio. We've invested now significantly, which I'll come to around watsonx Code Assistant for Z, but we've taken that from a down mid-single-digit portfolio to now capitalizing on the stack economics of our mainframe, execution and move that to low-single-digit. Now for the year, as you heard, we are taking up our guidance just given the strength of first half to mid-single-digit. You know, when you get into 2025, we'll talk about our guidance going forward, but we feel very confident that we can continue growing this and that's why we're investing in bringing out new capabilities like watsonx Code Assistant for Z, which is resonating extremely well. Yes. Thanks Toni for the question. Just building on what Arvind said. I mean, first of all, we're very pleased with the early momentum that we've gotten with our book of business around GenAI, both on the technology side with our watsonx platform and now with our open innovation strategy around RHEL AI, OpenShift Granite model's InstructLab, etc. But let's just deep -- dive a little deeper into your question about Consulting, because I think when you look at Consulting, first of all, why is it so important right now in a early part of a cycle? It's important because it's got to establish IBM Consulting as the strategic provider of choice for enterprises as they're going through what we'd like to call digital transformation 2.0 with GenAI. Everyone is looking for who is going to be their strategic provider and partner. And I think $1.5 billion over $1.5 billion book of business in the first 12 months, which by the way is in excess of the ramp we saw play out with hybrid cloud and Red Hat, we're off to a pretty good start. Now, to Arvind's point, you know, in every technology shift, very different dynamics between a Human Capital based business and a product IP business. Human Capital based business, we do see and we expected clients will shift and reprioritize spending. They're doing that now as they're driving large enterprise transformation projects, which is what our portfolio has been able to capture, and that's why you see nice acceleration in growth in our backlog up healthy at 5%. But to Arvind's point, we do think once you get through the early cycle, this is an incremental expansion of TAM that drives a long-tail growth vector over time that has multiplier opportunities for us. So when you look at our consulting book of business, let's dive into the sub-segments, you see business transformation services, which a lot of the GenAI plays out too early right now. That is how do you transform the way you operate HR, finance, supply-chain. We've doubled and accelerated our growth quarter-to-quarter. What you're seeing is a reprioritization and dynamic spending decisions by clients because our AO, where we have a lot of short-term discretionary staff augmentation work, there's a lot of trade-offs between those two. So, it's important for us strategically with our client base, but I think you see how it plays out. Now, just to wrap up the full picture, Software, I think is fundamentally different. Our software book of business now $0.5 billion through the first 12 months. I think inception-to-date right now, we're about two-thirds of subscription, SaaS, one-third perpetual. I think that's contributing nicely about a point of growth. And by the way, that's one of the two components of why we took our software up for the year. So, I think that's predominantly all lift. Yes. Thanks Arvind and thanks Amit for the question overall. You know, let's put this in perspective, right? You go back 90 days ago, how did we see the year kind of playing out with Consulting? We said at that point in time, we had backlog growing nicely mid-single-digit, albeit we did talk about durations going up because large scale transformations were really where the spend was moving to. But we had a solid book-to-bill trailing 12 months over 1.15. We had GenAI momentum that was going to continue throughout the year early in the cycle. We had strategic partnerships, Red Hat growth profile, and we had future acquisitions as we're going to continue to be opportunistic around our M&A criteria and the synergistic value of how consulting plays to our portfolio. If you look right now, 90 days later, as we look to the second-half, many of those are still playing out. You got GenAI, which arguably were above our own expectations, right now doubling, by the way, in Consulting, our GenAI book of business quarter-to-quarter, strategic partnerships, especially hyperscalers, Red Hat still growing nicely. What you're seeing, you know, at the end of the day, those are large scale transformations, lower yield, that's why Arvind and I are saying these are longer-term growth vectors and tails that will play out into '25, '26 and beyond as we get that strategic provider of choice. But in the interim, what you're seeing is that spending reprioritization around short-term discretionary that I think, you know, everyone in the industry is talking about. We're all dealing with this. The key is we have to win that strategic provider of choice in GenAI. And I would argue we're off to a great start. You look at competitor numbers overall, we got $1.5 billion over $1.5 billion book of business doubling quarter-to-quarter right now. I think we're in pretty good shape. That's what we're focused on because that will provide the future revenue multiplier effect as we move forward. Hey, Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Very good question overall. But let's take a step back on your first part of the question around free cash flow. Yes, we're very pleased with the start of the year. Free cash flow of $4.5 billion, up $1.1 billion year-to-year, 4 points above historical attainment. It's our largest first half free cash flow generation as far back as I can go and count. So, we're off to a pretty good start and that gives us the confidence overall of how we're positioning second-half. But the second half and why we took the guidance up is entirely driven by the strength of the fundamentals of our business and flowing through the adjusted EBITDA overachievement. So, read that, although we don't guide on EPS, the strong overachievement of the $0.25 of EPS, we're flowing that through to adjusted EBITDA and that flows through to our guide take-up on free cash flow. The rest of the free cash flow dynamics we've been talking about all year long around, yes, we got benefits of change in retirement plans and cash tax that's going to be a headwind and other balance sheet items, none of that changes. One thing I will bring up and we said in the prepared remarks, but just so there's absolute clarity, we do expect to close the Palo Alto transaction here in the third quarter around certain assets of our QRadar business that will obviously generate a gain. We're excited about the new strategic relationship between our two great companies overall, but we will take structural actions to offset that gain to address stranded cost. And oh, by the way, to your second part of your question, to accelerate our productivity initiatives in 2025, so you get the HashiCorp. First of all, the strategic transaction stands on its -- on its own. Arvind went through our M&A criteria. I think there's a very compelling strategic fit around an end-to-end leadership hybrid cloud platform. There's a lot of synergistic value both on product technology and go-to-market, but there's a very attractive financial profile that we talked about 90 days ago, higher revenue growth profile, adjusted EBITDA accretive in 12 months, free cash flow accretive to Arvind's point by two years. And we do see potential significant near-term cost in operating synergies that lead to about a 30% to 40% free cash flow margin business over a handful of years. Now, when you look at dilution, we understand dilution. I mean, M&A has been an integral part of our financial model for decades. So, underneath that, we understand the purchase growth of those transactions, the synergies of those transactions, the balance sheet capital structure implications of those. And with all that said, our model is to grow mid-single-digit revenue and grow operating leverage so we grow free cash flow quicker than revenue. We don't see that changing in 2025. We see growth profiles around revenue, around operating leverage and around free cash flow overall. And that speaks to the diversity or diversification, I should say, of our business model around productivity. We entered the year, raised it to $3 billion. We're getting out ahead of that again and you see that play out in our margins through the first-half, what, up 180 basis points on pre-tax. So, we've got many levers to deal with this overall. We know how to handle it."

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Yes. So Toni, let me start and then Jim will add more color on this topic. First, it's a great question and you laid out some of the dynamics that were going on in there. If we just step back and just look at our comments on the macroeconomic environment, we kind of stated that there is discretionary spend pressure in Consulting. When you do have that pressure, but there is a demand for AI, I would look you in the eye and say, probably the bulk of that demand, not all but the bulk is indeed a shift from other areas of Consulting. We don't actually believe it's cannibalistic to the point you're pointing out. Now, as time goes on and as people move from early experimentation and proving out the value to wanting to scale and really get the full benefits of generative AI, we do actually believe at that point, even for consulting, these will turn into accretive and additive, but we are still some time away from when that will happen. So, that is just to give you some color and acknowledging that the bulk, but not all is a shift. Jim? Hi. So Amit, let me just start and maybe address the second part of your question first and then. I actually do not believe there's any secular macro trend around weakness. I think that this is temporal based on a number of factors we have. The geopolitical uncertainty has gone longer than most people expected and that weighs into people's heads about what that might happen. And specifically, the war in Europe as well as the war in the Middle-East. Second, inflation has gone longer than people expected, which has the unfortunate consequence of higher interest rates and that begins to bear on people. If I look at those two altogether and that then at the moment you have higher interest rates and inflation, you have wage inflation, which does impact the bottom-line of our clients. You put all of that into perspective and is this going to go on for another six months? Likely. Is it going to go on for another year? I'm not so sure, but we got to get through the second half to be able to go there. So, that is why we are optimistic about the medium-term and long-term vector on Consulting. And as Jim answered in the prior question, we do see that this is going to become a tailwind over time, at least for us. Now, in the short-term for the next six months, we do think it holds up a little bit. In terms of answering the specifics and sort of decomposing some of the numbers that you laid out in the first part of your question, I'm going to turn that over to Jim. Hey, Jim, great question and thank you for asking this. Look, on overall M&A, I just want to begin with that our strategy has not changed. We are -- we are disciplined and we are focused. By focused, I mean we stick to the areas that we are investing in hybrid cloud and artificial intelligence. And by discipline, I mean it has to be not just aligned to our strategy, but we expect synergy from the acquisition, especially the multiples are higher as you pointed out and it has to be accretive to free cash flow if it's larger, definitely within two years at the outer end of the range. So having said that, if I look at it right now, we have HashiCorp out there. So, we got to get through that. We expect that to happen in the second-half of this year. We just finished StreamSets and webMethods and we've done a couple of smaller ones in the Consulting space and in other technology tuck-ins. What do we see going into this space? Our valuations rich, they're reasonably rich. They're not outrageous, I would say, like they had become in parts of late 2020 and 2021. So, I would say that they are more reasonable than then, but they're richer than they were about 18 months ago. There are different dynamics in both the public and the private markets. Public markets are quite variable. I mean, as we can see, some of the multiples and if you look at multiple to revenue, which is not a great metric, let me just acknowledge that, but it is one that's out there. If you look at six, seven, eight, maybe nine or 10 times, we can see our way there for a large deal as long as we have sufficient synergy. Now, for very small deals, that's not even a fair multiple. Very small deals are all about technology and people. In the private markets, we were very pleased with what we got done on StreamSets and webMethods. I would call that a private market deal, not a public market deal. And there, I think it all depends upon what's the property, what is its growth profile, what is the attractiveness of it to the seller versus the buyer, in this case us, all of that play into those multiples. I do expect that on the private side, valuations will be slightly less, but then the risk of going public or some other exit is also taken away. And in some sense, you get a discount for taking that risk off the table. For people who are venture-backed, that's different. They are looking at IPO versus a strategic exit and those are different multiples. But putting all of that together, we remain in the market and M&A is an important part of our growth methodology. We maintain a strong balance sheet for that purpose and we've kind of been clear of that. All that said, this year, we got a big one coming. So, we want to wait and get that done because part of the discipline is also making sure that we kind of digest them at the right rate and pace and put them into our global go-to-market distribution engine. Great question, Erik. So, let's just look at the Red Hat business in terms of how the dynamics function between our clients and ourselves. So, clients come in and create demand, we fulfill that. That shows up as bookings, not as revenue because the Red Hat business model is a pure consumption business model. Clients pay for what they're consuming and so the bookings then play out. Now, those bookings are a signal of further demand and typically they're anywhere from one-year to three-year worth of revenue that the client is pre-committing to. So, when we enter a year, about half the revenue, we can look at the bookings of the previous year and say that that gives us. The other half has to come over the quarter. Now that we have a year, not longer, but a year of the double-digit demand that you're talking about, if I remember right, it was 14%, 17%, 14%, 20% in terms of those demands. Now that full-year is there, that points to that for the portion that we can see, and as we get into a quarter, it climbs up from that 50% to 60% to 70% to 80% and Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, what he called CRPO or the revenue performance obligations, we see those sitting around mid-teens for the second half of the year to answer your question. Now, if that's about 80% and that will translate into low double digit is what we can look at and feel quite comfortable on. By the way, we see these early signs of the demand continue into this quarter and likely the half, which means that we expect to continue now in the low double digits going forward. So, I hope that that gives you a sense. But I'm also excited by the underlying product capabilities. We see OpenShift, which is extremely important. It plays into containerization, it plays into virtualization. It's an important element of how our clients exercise hybrid. It has been growing and the demand there grew again at about 40% this past quarter. But we also saw acceleration in Linux and enhanceable where both of those demand vectors grown to the low double-digits. That given the size of the Linux business is very good news for us going forward. So, I hope that that gives you some color on those pieces. And a vector that we have not talked about that will play, but probably into '25 and '26, we are very excited by our two open-source AI projects inside the Red Ad business, our RHEL AI as well as OpenShift AI. And as people begin to deploy at scale, but not only on public cloud, but also on-premise, leveraging their hybrid environment, we expect that both of those will also contribute into the Red Hat business, but that will take more time. So Matt, thank you for asking that question. And there was actually a question on developers before also. So, I'm sorry we didn't get to it fully. We'll get to it now in this question. Look, the whole question comes down to, there was a thesis out there about a year and a half ago that maybe one, maybe two extremely large models are going to run away with the bulk of the market share. We always felt that was both technically and economically infeasible. And I'll describe why. If you run an extremely large model on public clouds, the model by its nature is going to be expensive because a very large model needs a lot more compute, a lot more network, a lot more storage, a lot more memory, and we can see some of those dynamics play out. If you can drop the model size, you can drop all of that by 90%. I would actually tell you 99% reduction in the compute and memory and network costs, but let's call it 90% just for the sake of argument. So if you are running a -- like one of our clients was describing to me, they run a couple of billion transactions through their internal systems each day. If they had to go service those out to a large public cloud, the bill per day would have come back to be a couple of $100 million. You multiply that by 250, that's kind of an infeasible cost. If you can drop it by 90%, you're now bringing it down to the $10 million to $20 million a day. If you can actually run it using some of our Red Hat technologies on-premise, you can drop it by another 50%. You're not talking 5% to 10%. For what it can do, that is a very attractive proposition. So, now getting back to the models. If you have no idea what you're going to do, if you have no idea what you might be looking for, you go to a very large model because it contains all the possible elements. If you have a sense of what you need to do, I need to summarize emails. You need an English-language model if you're sitting here in the United States. If you are going to go change your Java or C++ or Python programmers to be more productive, you don't need a model that can write poetry and draw images. You need a model that understands programming languages. So, we are very, very proud of what our team has done. We can produce models that can do these things. So, these are two distinct models, one for programming, one for business language. They are one-tenth or less than that of the size of the extremely large models. But you can look on the leader boards, they perform quite as well as the largest models. So, that is kind of what our strategy is. However, if our clients want other models, we are also happy to work with other models and we have had that perspective. So, why open-source since that is part of your question? Why open-source is because often we find that clients want to increase the model's efficacy by adding their own unique language. People might want to write emails in a certain way. They might want to program in a certain way. They like comments in a certain style. I call that refining the model. We have a technique called InstructLab, but then clients get concerned. Wait, if I add my data, I don't want to give that away and back into a more public format. Can I keep that to myself? So, open sourcing our models under the Apache license gives our clients the freedom that what they add onto our underlying open model, they can keep to themselves. Now, to the developer point, putting all of that machinery into Red Hat Linux now gives us an avenue to open it up to developers as they can go experiment and play. By the way, I will turn around and tell you that for a developer who's not running production, who's just playing with things like all people do it. On a MacBook, you can begin to play around with models that are in the low tens of billions of parameters. That's a massive market that opens up. They get the freedom and flexibility that they don't have to give it back to us unless they want to. I am not actually concerned about this gives away the IP, as we have found through whether it's Red Hat Linux or whether other people have found through Mongo or other people have found through Hadoop, enterprises do look for and the last few days have certainly shown us, people look for patching, people look for security, people look for backward compatibility. There's a lot of enterprise reasons why people will still do business with us. But the open-source nature of what you asked, I'm so glad you did, allows us to expand that market into the millions of developers who do run Linux on their own machines or their corporate machines or their laptops and they can go experiment, add their innovation and either give it back to the community or actually reserve it for their enterprise. So, that's how we kind of tap into the whole developer ecosystem. So, let me now wrap up the call. In the second quarter of 2024, we executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation. We saw strong performance across our portfolio. We are excited about our early traction in generative AI. We look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year. Thank you all."

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. \n Now I will turn the meeting over to Olympia McNerney, IBM's Global Head of Investor Relations. Olympia, you may begin. \nOlympia McNerney: Thank you. I'd like to welcome you to IBM's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Presentation. \n I'm Olympia McNerney, and I'm here today with Arvind Krishna, IBM's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jim Kavanaugh, IBM's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. \n We'll post today's prepared remarks on the IBM investor website within a couple of hours, and a replay will be available by this time tomorrow. \n To provide additional information to our investors, our presentation includes certain non-GAAP measures. For example, all of our references to revenue and signings growth are at constant currency. We provided reconciliation charts for these and other non-GAAP financial measures at the end of the presentation, which is posted to our investor website. \n Finally, some comments made in this presentation may be considered forward-looking under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements involve factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially. Additional information about these factors is included in the company's SEC filings. \n So with that, I'll turn the call over to Arvind. \nArvind Krishna: Thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we had solid performance across revenue and cash flow. These results are further proof of the quality of our portfolio and our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We had good performance in Software, at the high end of our model; continued strength in Infrastructure, above our model; while Consulting was below model. On a relative basis, Consulting outperformed the market. \n Our cash flow generation is the strongest first quarter level we have reported in many years. This performance speaks to the strength of our diversified business model.\n Before we get into more detail on the quarter, let me address the announcement of our agreement to acquire HashiCorp, a company we have partnered with for a long time and believe is a tremendous strategic fit with IBM. Enterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure applications across public and private cloud as well as on-prem environments, making this the ideal time to pursue this acquisition. \n As generative AI deployment accelerates alongside traditional workloads, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies. HashiCorp has a proven track record of helping clients manage the complexity of today's infrastructure by automating, orchestrating and securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp is a great strategic addition to our portfolio, extending Red Hat's hybrid cloud capabilities to provide end-to-end automated infrastructure and security life cycle management. \n HashiCorp's technology is foundational to enabling the transition to hybrid and multi-cloud, and Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure automation for these environments. With security top of mind for every enterprise, Vault is a powerful secrets management offering to automate identity security across applications. The combination will also bolster our leading IT automation platform to address the sprawling complexity of AI-driven application and infrastructure growth. \n HashiCorp's products have wide-scale adoption in the developer community, highlighting the pervasive nature of their technology used by over 85% of the Fortune 500 and downloaded over 0.5 billion times. The acquisition of HashiCorp builds on IBM's commitment to industry collaboration, the developer community and open source hybrid cloud and AI innovation. \n Today's acquisition is consistent with our M&A strategy. We have taken a disciplined approach to M&A, and HashiCorp aligns well across all our key criteria to continue to focus and strengthen our portfolio, on hybrid cloud and AI, deliver synergies with the rest of IBM and be near-term accretive to free cash flow. \n I will now turn it to Jim to discuss the financial implications. \nJames Kavanaugh: Thank you, Arvind. Let me start with the details of the transaction. We have agreed to acquire HashiCorp for $6.4 billion in enterprise value to be funded by cash on hand. The transaction was approved by HashiCorp's Board of Directors. Closing is anticipated by the end of 2024, subject to approval by HashiCorp's shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. \n We have been executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy, and the acquisition of HashiCorp meets all of our criteria, including strategic fit, as Arvind just walked through, synergies across IBM and financial accretion. \n Let me start by addressing synergies. We see multiple drivers of product synergies within IBM and accelerating growth for HashiCorp. Product synergies span across multiple strategic growth areas for IBM, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and consulting. For example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible automation platforms configuration management and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. \n We are well positioned to drive growth for HashiCorp by leveraging IBM's enterprise incumbency and global reach. With 70% of the revenue today coming from the U.S., the opportunity to scale HashiCorp across IBM's operations in 175 countries is significant. \n We also believe we can accelerate HashiCorp's adoption with IBM clients. To put this in perspective, only about 20% of the Forbes Global 2000 are HashiCorp customers and just 25% of HashiCorp customers result in more than $100,000 annual recurring revenue, underscoring the opportunity to better monetize and upsell their products. \n Bringing it all together, the acquisition allows us to deliver a more comprehensive hybrid cloud offering to enterprise clients, enhancing IBM's ability to capture global cloud opportunity. This will drive a higher growth profile over time. \n Finally, we expect to realize operating efficiencies and expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA within the first full year post close and to free cash flow in year 2. Significant near-term cost synergies underpin the financial profile of the transaction, while product synergies represent further upside. We are very comfortable with our strong balance sheet, liquidity profile and solid investment-grade rating and remain committed to our dividend policy. \n I'll now turn it back to Arvind. \nArvind Krishna: Now turning back to the quarter. Let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. \n We expect the global economy to behave similarly to last year, albeit with some uncertainty due to persistently high interest rates. There are reasons to believe technology will be even more important in 2024 as clients focus on productivity improvements and customer experience. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. \n I will now provide some details on the execution of our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI. \n Enterprise AI continues to gain traction. This year, we anticipate more clients moving from experimenting to deploying AI at scale to unlock productivity. We are pleased with the solid progress of our AI offerings. Each quarter, we are winning more clients, expanding partnerships and introducing new innovations. \n Inception to date, our book of business related to watsonx and generative AI is greater than $1 billion with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Similar to last quarter, this remains weighted towards Consulting. \n We believe our comprehensive AI strategy is well positioned to help clients scale AI. We developed our watsonx platform for clients to build their AI solutions, spanning from foundation model training to data preparation and governance. This includes both IBM/Red Hat models and third-party models, giving our clients variety as well as efficiency and focus on enterprise domains that IBM brings. \n We have leveraged watsonx to build AI assistance through our software portfolio. Our consultants are helping clients navigate the AI landscape. And finally, we are seeing our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. Let me touch on these infrastructure dynamics briefly. \n As AI becomes widely adopted, IBM Z is uniquely advantaged. We believe a lot of AI inferencing will happen where the data is for security, efficiency and latency reasons. Our full-stack focus, from on-chip AI processing to AI accelerator cards, to watsonx platform support, allows models to be built and trained on any platform and easily deployed on IBM Z. \n The Telum chip is a unique differentiator, enabling real-time AI inferencing. Generative AI is also driving lift for our storage offerings where industry-leading performance and scalability is utilized for data curation, model building and fine-tuning. \n For enterprises to deploy AI at scale, AI is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It requires tuned, domain-specific models trained with quality data to maximize its impact. Clients value the flexibility of our approach. They appreciate having the ability to leverage a combination of AI models, whether they're IBMs; their own models; open source models, such as Llama from Meta and Mixtral from Mistral. And they can deploy these AI models across multiple environments. The flexibility we offer is resonating as our use cases are both large and more efficient models. \n We are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. \n We see early parallels to Linux in making open source AI models performant for enterprise use. We believe that IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open source AI. As you know, we have done a lot of work with AI models and recently released a family of state-of-the-art open source code models from our Granite series. Red Hat and IBM also recently launched Instruct Lab to evolve and improve AI models through incremental community contributions, much like open source software. This open strategy is resonating around the world. We recently announced a collaboration with the Spanish government to leverage IBM's investments across their entire AI stack and open source to build the world's leading suite of foundation models proficient in the Spanish language. \n Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service and digital labor remain top of mind for our clients. This quarter, we signed a multiyear contract with Providence Health to reimagine talent and HR workflows with AI from IBM and partners. We're also providing data-driven insights and enabling Spanish language narration for this year's Masters golf tournament. \n Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth. This quarter, we progressed strategic partnerships with a number of industry leaders. Consulting joined forces with NVIDIA to accelerate clients' AI journeys. ServiceNow will embed watsonx AI capabilities into the ServiceNow platform to accelerate enterprise digital transformation. We also expanded our relationship with Adobe around OpenShift and watsonx as it relates to the Adobe Experience Platform. \n We continue to invest in emerging technology as well, bringing new innovations to the market. Since we put the world's first Quantum system on the cloud in 2016, we have deployed over 80 Quantum systems, and our users have run over 3 trillion programs to date. We just installed a Quantum System One at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This is the first IBM Quantum system on a college campus anywhere in the world. This installation will advance research in critical areas such as energy storage, material science and financial modeling. \n As always, focusing on our portfolio remains a key priority. We closed the sale of The Weather Company in the first quarter and expect to close the announced acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG by midyear. \n Overall, we had a positive start to the year, which gives us confidence in our next quarter and full year expectations. \n Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you. \nJames Kavanaugh: Thanks, Arvind. In the first quarter, we delivered $14.5 billion in revenue; $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA; $1.7 billion of operating pretax income; $1.68 operating earnings per share; and we generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up approximately $600 million year-over-year. \n Our revenue for the quarter was up 3% at constant currency. We saw an impact to our top line performance from the closing of The Weather Company earlier than expected in the quarter. \n Software grew by 6% with growth across Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing and continued strength in our recurring revenue base. \n Consulting was up 2%, reflecting organic growth. We continue to have solid signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of over 1.15. \n Infrastructure had strong performance, delivering growth across all of our hardware offerings. \n Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 100 basis points and operating pretax margin by 130 basis points over last year, inclusive of about 100 basis point currency headwind to pretax margin. \n At the end of January, we closed on the divestiture of The Weather Company, generating a pretax gain of $241 million in the quarter. Mitigating that benefit, we took charges of $374 million to address workforce rebalancing. \n Operating pretax margin was up 50 basis points, excluding the year-over-year impacts of workforce rebalancing and divestiture dynamics. We are pleased with this performance, in line with our guidance of roughly 50 basis points of operating pretax margin improvement in 2024. \n Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. This allows for continued investments to drive innovation, which you can see in our higher R&D expense. The timing of discrete tax items this quarter resulted in an operating tax rate of about 6%. We are still expecting a full year operating tax rate consistent with last year. \n Overall, the combination of our revenue and operating margin performance resulted in 7% growth in our adjusted EBITDA. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $600 million year-over-year. This growth reflects the performance of our underlying business, with adjusted EBITDA up $200 million year-over-year and about $400 million from timing of balance sheet dynamics and CapEx. \n Over the last 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $11.8 billion. This puts us on track to deliver about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, with the growth largely driven by adjusted EBITDA. \n Since our acquisition of Red Hat, excluding 2021 when we spun off Kyndryl, our operating net income to free cash flow realization averaged 120%. Two factors drive this. One is stock-based compensation, which today represents 15 points of realization. And two, given the shift in our portfolio to a growing software business, deferred income also contributes to our realization. \n In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash of $19.3 billion, up from $13.5 billion at year-end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was $59.5 billion, including $9.9 billion from our financing business. \n Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6% with good performance across both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. As mentioned in January, the Software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, acquisitions, strong recurring revenue and transaction processing. And this is just how the first quarter played out. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 7%. Let me spend a minute on the various elements. \n Red Hat revenue grew 9%, reflecting solid performance across the 3 key solutions: RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible. Annual bookings growth was again in the mid-teens, with OpenShift up over 40% this quarter and RHEL and Ansible each up double digits. \n Beyond Red Hat, recent acquisitions contributed to the growth profile of Hybrid Platform & Solutions as did new innovation areas, including watsonx. The combination of Apptio, acquired mid-last year, and our IT automation portfolio has delivered strong results, unlocking the full benefits of a fin op solution for technology investments across hybrid cloud environments. In fact, just this quarter, we partnered with Microsoft to bring Apptio to Azure and we'll co-sell to our joint customers, and Microsoft has agreed to adopt Apptio's capabilities in parts of their organization. \n Our revenue performance continues to reflect growth in our high-value recurring revenue base. Our ARR, after removing The Weather Company and security services, is now $13.9 billion, up over 8% since last year. \n Transaction Processing, with its strong base of recurring revenue, delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms. And there's an increasing interest in generative AI application modernization capabilities, like watsonx Code Assistant for Z. \n Software segment profit was up 80 basis points while absorbing both key investments in innovation and about 1 point of currency impact in the quarter. We continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue performance this quarter. \n Our Consulting revenue was up 2%. We continue to see clients prioritizing large data and technology transformation projects focused on driving productivity with AI and analytics. These results reflect the organic performance of our business. \n Solid demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 4%, our highest absolute first quarter signings in recent history, and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15. \n Our overall backlog remains healthy, up 7% year-over-year, and backlog erosion levels remain stable. At the same time, we saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large-scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tightened discretionary spending. \n Contributing to growth across the business this quarter, our strategic partnerships continue to make up over 40% of our Consulting revenue, with both AWS and Azure practices growing double digits. Additionally, our Red Hat practice grew revenue double digits. Expanding upon our partnerships, we are leveraging Microsoft Copilot to drive productivity for our clients. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful book of business around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are ahead of pace at this stage with our generative AI book of business. \n Turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 3% led by supply chain and finance transformations. Customer experience transformations also contributed to growth. \n Technology Consulting revenue was also up 3% with double-digit growth in cloud modernization projects, and both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements delivered double-digit growth. \n Application Operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management projects, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. \n Moving to Consulting profit. We delivered over 8% of segment profit margin, which is flat year-to-year. Our segment profit margin was impacted by about 1 point of currency, offsetting improvements in pricing and productivity actions we have taken. \n Moving to Infrastructure. Revenue grew, reflecting growth in Hybrid Infrastructure of 6% and declines in Infrastructure Support of 7%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, growth was broad-based with strong demand from our hardware offerings across IBM Z, Power and Storage. \n In IBM Z, revenue was up 5% in the eighth quarter of z16 product availability. Now 2 years in, this product cycle continues to resonate with clients and surpassed z15 revenue performance. IBM Z is uniquely positioned for AI with the first processor design with on-chip acceleration for real-time AI inferencing. In fact, we're working with over 100 clients on the application of AI on z16. Use cases range from fraud detection to anti-money laundering, to anomaly detection. This remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption but also related software, storage and services. \n Distributed Infrastructure delivered 7% revenue growth with strength in both Power and Storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads. Storage delivered strong double-digit revenue growth, including demand for high-end storage tied to the Z16 cycle. And clients are also looking to our storage offerings for data curation, model building and fine-tuning and support of generative AI. \n Looking at Infrastructure profit. We delivered both gross profit and segment profit margin expansion. Segment profit margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing about 1 point of impact from currency. \n Now let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. More than 2 years into our midterm model, we are a more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue and free cash flow growth. Over this time, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and drive productivity across our business. \n Our first quarter performance is another proof point of this progress with constant currency revenue growth, operating gross margin and operating pretax margin expansion, and the strongest first quarter free cash flow in many years. \n Looking to the full year 2024, we are holding our view on our 2 primary metrics: revenue and free cash flow. We see full year constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. \n On the segments. In Software, we had a solid start to the year and continue to expect growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In Consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations. Though, as I said, we are seeing some pressure on smaller, more discretionary projects. We now see mid-single-digit revenue growth in Consulting with acceleration throughout the year. Given our ongoing productivity initiatives and investment in innovation, we expect to see about 1 point of segment profit margin expansion in both of these segments. And in Infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect revenue to decline, driving about a 0.5 point impact to our overall growth. \n Given IBM Z cycle dynamics, we expect segment profit margin to be lower year-over-year. With these segment dynamics, we continue to expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year, consistent with our view 90 days ago, and we are maintaining our view of operating tax for the year to be consistent with last year, in the mid-teens range. \n We took a workforce rebalancing charge this quarter. And as I mentioned 90 days ago, we continue to see the overall amount this year consistent with last year. We expect this to pay back by the end of the year. \n On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 150 to 200 basis point impact to revenue growth for the year, which is about 1 point worse than 90 days ago. \n For the second quarter, I expect our constant currency revenue growth rate to be consistent with the full year. Our tax rate is expected to be in the high teens. And for profit, we expect the first half skew of net income will remain a couple of points ahead of the prior year. \n In closing, we are pleased with our performance to start the quarter. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit margin and grow free cash flow for the year. \n Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started. \nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Jim. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to mention a couple of items. First, supplemental information is provided at the end of the presentation. And then second, as always, I'd ask you to refrain from multipart questions. \n Operator, let's please open it up for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. \nAmit Daryanani: I guess I was hoping you could talk a bit more on the Consulting side of the business because revenues did decelerate rather notably in March quarter, but I think, on the other side, your AI-centric backlog at over $1 billion is doing extremely well. So I'm hoping you'd touch on the near-term side, what are you hearing from your customers? What are they telling you around the duration of this pause? Because I think the expectation of mid-single-digit growth would imply this business will recover rather quickly. So I'd just love to get a sense on what are customers' view on Consulting, in terms of the duration of the pause? And then longer term, what does the opportunity look like given the AI-centric backlog appears a lot more robust versus what I think folks have expected beyond '24? \nJames Kavanaugh: Thanks, Amit. I appreciate the question. Let's take a step back because I think you're seeing some interesting dynamics in the consulting industry overall. And let's bifurcate it between how you asked the question. Let's look at real demand that's being measured in bookings, and then let's talk about what's happening with the revenue realization. \n On demand, we continue to see and capitalize on solid demand in key areas around digital transformation, application modernization and Gen AI. Our signings in the quarter, up 4%, the strongest absolute first quarter signings we've had as far back as I can go. We have a strong book-to-bill, over 1.15 on a trailing 12 months. Our backlog dynamic is in a very strong position, 7% overall with stable erosion, but our duration has been going up the last 2 quarters. It's been up a couple of months. \n But let's talk about the underpinnings of what's driving demand because I think that's what's most important around the key growth focus areas. You talked about Gen AI. Gen AI for IBM, Arvind indicated, inception to date, over a $1 billion book of business. Consulting in the first quarter, the book of business on Gen AI was 2x all of last year, so I think we're winning in the marketplace. We're taking share. And by the way, we're well above that ramp we saw with regards to Red Hat. \n Our strategic partnerships still have great velocity, book-to-bill well north of 1.2. Our Red Hat book business is now $2.8 billion ARR around hybrid cloud. And we're seeing very nice acceleration in Gen AI and digital transformation around core workflow use case areas of finance, supply chain, HR and talent. So I think in the key focus areas, is our demand profile still continues to be good. \n Now let's translate that to revenue. Revenue, first of all, in the first quarter, as we indicated, it was all organic. We ramped on our acquisitions. We continue to operate a very disciplined M&A process and we continue to be opportunistic, but that 2% revenue growth was all organic quarter-to-quarter. Second, in this marketplace, you look at competition, we're taking share still. \n So when you look at it, 90 days ago, we talked about the year. We talked about the year was going to play out accelerating throughout the year. Why? Because, one, we knew we had a strong backlog and that backlog realization showed us that it was going to play out throughout the year with sequential improvement. But second, Easter. Easter, we knew calendar was there, it was at the end of March. That does impact a human capital-based business on a number of billing days. \n So when you look then at first quarter, that backlog duration extending out a couple of months. We also saw, though, less revenue backlog yield, and that really played out if you look at our subsegments, in Application Operations. That's centered around custom AMS applications which, by the way, many of that, as you know quite well, is volume-based business. And that volume, like I said, backlog is stable overall. We're not losing the business. That is moving out to the right. \n So with all that said, what are we focused on? We're focused on capturing new client demand in areas around our key growth areas. Two, we're continuing to focus and we are gaining share in the marketplace. Three, we're driving that economic multiplier of consulting and technology across our hybrid cloud and AI platform. \n So in light of all that, that's why you see the mid-single-digit growth. I think that's prudent just given what every other consulting competitors come out with. By the way, that still drives 1.5 points of growth to IBM for the full year. And as I stated earlier, we see an accelerated growth profile as we move through the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. \nWamsi Mohan: Arvind would love to get a little bit more of sort of a macro demand backdrop. I mean I know Jim mentioned the tightened discretionary spending in some areas. How do you think about the risk of that sort of filtering more broadly as you go through the course of the year, especially given your guidance calls for an accelerating trend here? \n And if I could, quickly, Jim, the synergies relative to HashiCorp on the cost side, is there any way you can dimensionalize that given that, when you're defining accretion on EBITDA basis, I get that, but can you also help on the net income basis or from a free cash flow how much it might be dilutive in year 1 and accretive on year 2? \nArvind Krishna: Thanks, Wamsi. So let me address your thought about the demand profile globally. So if I look at where we are right now and where we project for the rest of the year, demand is actually quite strong. I would put it as very similar to 2023. This is backed up by IMF GDP estimates, which are now north of 3% for the global business.\n If I look at it by geography, Japan remains very strong. I think that they are taking this opportunity to refresh the technology across their enterprise and government base. If you look at South Asia, extremely strong; even the Middle East, U.A.E., Saudi, very strong; Europe has remained consistent to last year; North and South America. So on a geography basis, we're seeing very, very strong demand. \n Now interest rates are higher than people were expecting. I think we should acknowledge that. That means you get two effects going on. One, there is even stronger demand for software and infrastructure because people believe technology helps you in those environments and helps in an environment of increased labor costs and increased supply chain costs. Then when you look at the discretionary side, Jim answered this in the previous question, we are seeing a little bit, not across the board, not in all of the offerings in consulting, but where there is a little bit of discretionary labor, that is where we sense that pressure. \n What we are going to do is pivot into the areas around helping people become more productive, take more cost out, digital transformation, work with our partners where there is very strong demand in the market. And as you pivot there, we believe that our growth rate in Consulting will continue to accelerate. \n So I hope, Wamsi, that, that gave you a flavor on the demand vectors we have, both in Software and Infrastructure and in Consulting and on a geography basis. \n Jim, over to you for part 2. \nJames Kavanaugh: Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. As Arvind indicated in the prepared remarks, we couldn't be more excited about the powerful combination of HashiCorp with IBM and Red Hat together. We talked about it in the prepared remarks, we've been very disciplined in our set of criteria around M&A. And this fits strategically. It has tremendous synergistic value to our hybrid cloud and AI portfolio and it has an attractive financial return overall. \n And Hashi meets all three: One, it's a higher revenue growth profile company, so it accelerates IBM's revenue growth over time; two, to your question, adjusted EBITDA accretive in the first 12 months; and three, levered free cash flow accretive by the end of year 2. We think there are a potential for meaningful synergies overall and, when we look at it, significant near-term operating efficiencies, cost synergies. And to put that in perspective, we see this business profile moving from about a mid-single-digit free cash flow margin business to about a 30% to 40% free cash flow margin business in a handful of years, free cash flow accretive by the end of year 2. \n Now the multiple we paid on that, fully supported by, one, the stand-alone revenue growth and the cost synergies that come out. All of the IBM revenue synergies around Red Hat, around data security, around watsonx, around consulting and IT automation are all upside potential. \n So let's talk and conclude on the cost synergy. Cost synergies are where you would fully expect. IBM runs a global operations in 175 countries. We run a very disciplined G&A-efficient structure. We see significant G&A operating efficiencies that we're going to go capitalize on. Second, running the playbook on how we expand it globally, our go-to-market model that we did with Red Hat, and that has both global incumbency, global scale, global breadth and ecosystem leverage overall. And when you look at that, those significant synergies allow us to invest in product, R&D, innovation and capability that's built into our case and also deliver our financial returns, so we feel pretty good about it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. \nToni Sacconaghi: Jim, just to clarify, you've taken down your consulting outlook for the year from 6% to 8% to 5%. I think that's about 60 basis points to company growth. Is there anything offsetting that? Or is that just kind of a rounding error, in the low single-digit guidance? \n And then my question is, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit more on the AI book of business, maybe just help clarify exactly how you define that. I think it's both revenue recognized and your bookings. And maybe partner bookings, maybe you could just help define that? And last quarter, you said it doubled sequentially. This quarter, you just commented that it grew sequentially, maybe you could add a little color. Was that double digits or 20% or 30% or 40%? And at least when I do the math, it sounds like it's less than 5% of your Consulting backlog, AI backlog. Could you help to mention that as well? \nJames Kavanaugh: Okay, Toni. Many questions here, let me see if I can get through them quick. You look at full year, full year, as Arvind indicated, we're maintaining our guidance on our model mid-single digit, I think, prudently just coming out of a first quarter. We've got a lot of work to do in the next 3 quarters, but I think prudently, at the low end of that model. By the way, that was very consistent with what we said 90 days ago. \n Now let's unpack that. When you take a look at full year, first of all, we are dealing with a stronger U.S. dollar. So we've given you supplemental chart, now we've lost basically about 1 point more of headwind on currency. \n Well, let's talk about the underlying fundamentals of our business across our segments because I think that's at the heart of your question. When you take a look at our growth at mid-single digit, one, we said software would grow slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. We are very pleased with our Software performance in the first quarter. We've accelerated growth from fourth quarter to 6% overall. We have a very strong recurring revenue base. We accelerated Red Hat to a very strong 9% with our third consecutive quarter of mid-teen booking growth, which positions our business extremely well for double-digit growth for the full year, and we're getting nice scale and leverage on acquisitions. \n Software for the year will deliver over 3 points of that IBM mid-single digit by itself. Based on that Red Hat momentum, acquisitions, solid recurring revenue; TP, by the way, nice start, up 4%; and new innovation like watsonx. Consulting, we said for the full year, appropriately, in light of the market and still gaining share, would be mid-single digits. That will deliver about 1.5 points of growth to IBM. Why did we feel good about that? One, solid book-to-bill, winning in key focus areas, strategic partnerships, Gen AI scale overall. But like first quarter, we're going to continue to monitor that backlog realization to see how that plays out. \n But between Software and Consulting, over 3 points in Software, about 1.5 points, now you get to Infrastructure. We started out well above what we expected here in the first quarter. Mainframe, eighth quarter in, grew 5%. Our Distributed Infrastructure, Power and Storage, both grew double digits as we're capitalizing on Distributed Infrastructure and demand requirements for Gen AI. Full year, that's a little bit better than what we thought 90 days ago off our first start, so we expect about a little bit less than 0.5 point impact to IBM. You throw on top of that, we executed the closure of The Weather Company, that would be about 0.5 point. So that's kind of how we build up our full year overall. \n So AI book of business, I think you nailed it in your question. It's, one, on a Consulting perspective, it's our signings book of business overall. And on our Software, it's our subscription, our SaaS and perpetual licenses. Again, as you know, we offer clients flexibility on how they want to purchase that overall. \n And Consulting backlog, yes, 5% overall. I would tell you, let's put it in perspective, it's probably mid- to high single digits. But we've got, give or take, about a $30 billion book of business on backlog with Consulting. So coming from where we started, less than 9 months ago, I think that's a very good ramp. And let's put it in perspective. When we drove the hybrid cloud platform-centric play with Consulting, which has done extremely well, over the first 4 quarters, we did a $1 billion book of business. Right now, through less than 3 quarters, we're very damn close to that $1 billion book of business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. \nBenjamin Reitzes: I wanted to ask about Red Hat. You accelerated it to 9% in the quarter from 7%. What is your confidence level you get to the mid-teens, which kind of equals your bookings growth? And then on Red Hat, the follow-up would be, how much can HashiCorp augment that growth rate? And can you clarify the synergies a little bit more between Red Hat and Hashi? And was Hashi needed to help grow Red Hat? Or is it a bonus? How do you see that? \nArvind Krishna: Ben, let me take the first part of those questions. We are very, very pleased with Red Hat. If I look at Red Hat now, we have had mid-teens or better bookings growth for the last 3 quarters, third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter. That, combined with the growth we are seeing in OpenShift as well as in both Ansible and RHEL, OpenShift growing almost 40%, gives us a lot of confidence. So bookings growth plus OpenShift plus what we're seeing in the revenue now at 9% tells us that we should see that Red Hat growth continue or accelerate through the year. \n Two, let me just address the macro point. Hashi is a nice add for the Red Hat portfolio. But it's not inside Red Hat, let's just be clear. So when we talk about Red Hat growth numbers in line and accelerating, that is Red Hat as is. Hashi will be measured in software, but in IBM software, not in Red Hat. Where the synergy comes is, we believe, there will be added demand because if a combined portfolio is more interesting, we think even more clients will talk to us. That is how Hashi will help Red Hat. It's not that the Hashi revenue counts at all for the numbers we just mentioned. So we kind of want to be clear on that. \n Hashi to us is an accelerant for IBM strategy and for software strategy, and Hashi helps in being offensive in terms of giving us an overall better portfolio. So even more clients want to do business with us in the environments they're going to. That's kind of how I'd pitch it. And people know Hashi really well for their infrastructure management, but the security pieces of Hashi are also very, very interesting and really important as people navigate these very complex environments with all the worries about people losing secrets and keys and that resulting ransomware or hacking attacks. And that's kind of how I would paint the picture on that side. \nJames Kavanaugh: Yes, I would just add one other point, Ben. As you and I and many of the investors have talked about since first quarter earnings, we've kind of bifurcated this business when we saw the slowdown happen in second half last year between our subscription-based business within Red Hat versus our consumption-based services and offerings, the former being about 80% of our portfolio, the latter being about 20%. \n If you look at first quarter, as Arvind indicated, we're very pleased. Coming off of a 2-plus point acceleration positions us extremely well, even more confident in that double-digit for the year. But the reason why we're even more confident is that 80% of that portfolio, that subscription business, we accelerated 3 points quarter-to-quarter in revenue and we were above double digits. \n On the consumption base, we finally saw a stabilization. We didn't see acceleration, we saw stabilization. But remember, we start ramping on that in the second half, so that provides us a tailwind in the second half. But our subscription business today, the 80%, 3 points acceleration, double-digit in the first quarter, all 3 major lines broad-based double-digit bookings; Red Hat OpenShift, over 40% booking strength; $1.3 billion ARR book of business, growing 25-plus percent; Ansible taking share, we feel even more confident as I said. \nOperator: Next question comes from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. \nErik Woodring: Arvind, maybe this one is for you. If we include the Software AG assets and now HashiCorp, I think you spent about $16 billion on acquisitions since your 2021 Analyst Day. Back then, you talked about kind of having $20 billion to $25 billion of M&A firepower you could leverage through 2024. Just curious, as we sit here today, your willingness or desire to go after more M&A for the rest of this year, would you be willing to go kind of above and beyond that total that you had laid out almost 3 years ago? And just as we think about the potential targets in the future, where do you believe you have gaps that you can still fill within your portfolio? \nArvind Krishna: Erik, let me just maybe address the macro points on it, and I'll let Jim talk to some of the numbers here. We are going to remain incredibly disciplined on our M&A strategy. We kind of said it, but I just want to repeat, we've got to find things that meet our strategy, we've got to have some synergy opportunities at IBM, and it has to be financially accretive within the second year. So if we find things that meet that and we are committed, I'll say, to both our dividend and our investment-grade ratings, then that is kind of the picture we go in. Now within that, we believe we have some level of flexibility and that is what we will operate in. So that gives you a sense there. \n By the way, while we've got these 2 yet to come, we've got Software AG that we hope to close midyear and HashiCorp which will come near the end of the year, we also have to look at what is our overall internal dynamics of making sure that we can succeed on these businesses as we proceed down the path. We need to build consulting practices. We need to have synergy plays in other parts of the portfolio. We have to enable our sales teams globally. As we say, a big part of our synergy is getting the amplification from our global footprint that is there with clients all around the world. Jim? \nJames Kavanaugh: Yes. Arvind, just building on your point, we are very confident in the capital structure of this company. We are committed to maintain a very solid investment-grade balance sheet. We are focused on debt leverage, obviously. But our primary capital allocation is to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically, and to maintain an attractive return to shareholder program with our dividend policy. So with all that said, just to reaffirm what Arvind indicated, we will remain in the market prudently evaluating complementary tuck-in opportunities that fit our M&A strategy, and we got the capability of doing that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. \nBrent Thill: Arvind, on the Software business, I mean, you've been ranging somewhere between 3% to 8%, 9% growth. Many have asked, it seems like the overall market is growing faster. What's going to take to unlock this incredible portfolio you've built to effectively maybe monetize at the rate the industry is growing out? Is there something that's causing friction to unlock that true potential of the Software business? Or are we just being too focused on the short term? What do you think unlocks that value in getting you to your closer TAM of the growth? \nArvind Krishna: So Brent, as you can imagine, we are very, very focused on that question. If I just want to lay out a 4-year trajectory, if you'll indulge me with just a minute, we began with a software portfolio that was, let's call it, flat, it would be a kind way of putting it, about 5 years ago. We've gone from flat to, as you said, some volatility. But we are now seeing that we can be north of 6% for this year, whether you want to call that 6.5% or 7%, and we are very confident in that. As we do organic innovation and as we do M&A, we will find that, that number will keep improving year-over-year. And I'm pointing to a very consistent 4-year trajectory of having achieved that. \n By the way, within that, we do find there are a couple of slower growing pieces, but they're incredibly important to our overall profile, both for incumbency with clients and for the cash flow that we produce. We would never expect our mainframe software, the TPS piece, to be growing in the high-single digits or in double digits. So as that mix also changes over time, then we find that we're going to get closer and closer. And we do want to, over time, get software to grow above where we are right now. So right now, we are at the upper end of the mid-single-digit model. I think you can conclude what would be the next step we will go at, and then we'll go from there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Essex with JPMorgan. \nBrian Essex: Another Red Hat one. Maybe, Arvind, if you could maybe give us a little bit of sense of what's going on in the pipeline there and whether or not you're seeing a substantial benefit in the Red Hat pipeline from the VMware acquisition, both on the consulting side as well as the software side. Are you seeing a lot of migration? And how much of an opportunity do you think might be there longer term to capture more share of that market? \nArvind Krishna: Brian, great question. So let me talk to some of the Red Hat dynamics. It's not so much directly related to VMware per se, but clients are all beginning to say, they're asking the question, which is the platform they want to bet on for the next 10 to 20 years on which they will write their applications, deploy them both in their own data centers and on public cloud. We find an incredible amount of interest in that question. And as we have built out the Red Hat portfolio not just for containers, because many people know OpenShift as a great container platform, but also for virtualization with both container-native virtualization and with the KVM hypervisor, we are finding a lot of interest around those topics. \n Then as we layer in, by the end of the year, the HashiCorp advantages of managing the infrastructure across all these environments, we do believe that, that will be an accelerant to the Red Hat portfolio. So first, RHEL has got its place as the primary place where people want to deploy, OpenShift as a platform for both containers and virtualization, Ansible and HashiCorp helping increase automation and reduce the complexity. We think all of this plays in. And Brian, I think the best number is the mid-teens bookings growth on the subscription side of the business. That speaks to the demand in terms of not only is there demand but we are realizing that demand in the book of business that we are getting clients to commit to on Red Hat. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets. \nMatthew Swanson: I think I might try a qualitative version of an earlier question around gen AI. And I think just we see so much of the news feed being around kind of the hype cycle, and obviously, growing $1 billion book of business shows you're monetizing it. Can you just talk about maybe the pain points that enterprises are looking to address when they first come to you or when those consulting relationships start? Like, how much of a plan is in place versus how much they're looking to you to kind of hold their hand in terms of this gen AI journey? \nArvind Krishna: I think, Matt, that's a great question. So let me maybe take that, and I'll address it from both the consulting side and the software side. If we look 12 months ago, I would say that there was a lot of excitement and there was a lot of experimentation that we're starting, and people were not thinking through what does this mean for my overall ROI, what are the economics of running gen AI, how do I get the people changes done so that the ROI can actually be realized. \n What is happening in all of my conversations this year, in the first quarter of 2024, is a lot of people have woken up that those issues need to be addressed as well. So when they talk to our consulting team, they are spending energy on, but can you help my people also do the transformation it takes, what is the change process through which you can recognize those things. They then go to immediately asking, in these models, how expensive is it to run them. And they begin to do the math, wait, if I run this model just for this one business process, the infrastructure costs alone could be $300 million a year. That doesn't close the ROI, can I do it in a much more cost-effective way but an equally good answer, and that is where you begin to see some of the models that IBM has produced. Our Granite series play very strongly into helping them recognize their ROI by reducing the economics. \n And then lastly, and this is advice that I gave to the C-suite usually, and it resonates, don't take lots of little experiments, try to pick a few use cases which can scale. And by scale, meaning that they actually do impact a large fraction of their employees or their clients' customers and they begin to have a large impact in how business is done by either improving revenue or by making the enterprise significantly more productive. That's kind of a conversation shift from simply, oh, this is a neat new tool, let me try out to see what I can do, not what I should do, but what I can do. And I think that, that is a big change in terms of helping the organization scale. \n So let me now wrap up the call. In the first quarter of 2024, we have executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation, allowing us to invest organically and through strategic acquisitions like HashiCorp. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year. \nOlympia McNerney: Thank you, Arvind. Operator, let me turn it back to you to close out the call. \nOperator: Thank you. Thank you all for participating on today's call. The conference has now ended. You may disconnect at this time.",

            "name": "Arvind Krishna",
            "content": "Thank you for joining us. In the first quarter, we had solid performance across revenue and cash flow. These results are further proof of the quality of our portfolio and our hybrid cloud and AI strategy. We had good performance in Software, at the high end of our model; continued strength in Infrastructure, above our model; while Consulting was below model. On a relative basis, Consulting outperformed the market. \n Our cash flow generation is the strongest first quarter level we have reported in many years. This performance speaks to the strength of our diversified business model.\n Before we get into more detail on the quarter, let me address the announcement of our agreement to acquire HashiCorp, a company we have partnered with for a long time and believe is a tremendous strategic fit with IBM. Enterprise clients are wrestling with an unprecedented expansion in infrastructure applications across public and private cloud as well as on-prem environments, making this the ideal time to pursue this acquisition. \n As generative AI deployment accelerates alongside traditional workloads, developers are working with increasingly heterogeneous, dynamic and complex infrastructure strategies. HashiCorp has a proven track record of helping clients manage the complexity of today's infrastructure by automating, orchestrating and securing hybrid and multi-cloud environments. HashiCorp is a great strategic addition to our portfolio, extending Red Hat's hybrid cloud capabilities to provide end-to-end automated infrastructure and security life cycle management. \n HashiCorp's technology is foundational to enabling the transition to hybrid and multi-cloud, and Terraform is the industry standard for infrastructure automation for these environments. With security top of mind for every enterprise, Vault is a powerful secrets management offering to automate identity security across applications. The combination will also bolster our leading IT automation platform to address the sprawling complexity of AI-driven application and infrastructure growth. \n HashiCorp's products have wide-scale adoption in the developer community, highlighting the pervasive nature of their technology used by over 85% of the Fortune 500 and downloaded over 0.5 billion times. The acquisition of HashiCorp builds on IBM's commitment to industry collaboration, the developer community and open source hybrid cloud and AI innovation. \n Today's acquisition is consistent with our M&A strategy. We have taken a disciplined approach to M&A, and HashiCorp aligns well across all our key criteria to continue to focus and strengthen our portfolio, on hybrid cloud and AI, deliver synergies with the rest of IBM and be near-term accretive to free cash flow. \n I will now turn it to Jim to discuss the financial implications. Now turning back to the quarter. Let me start with a few comments on the macroeconomic environment. \n We expect the global economy to behave similarly to last year, albeit with some uncertainty due to persistently high interest rates. There are reasons to believe technology will be even more important in 2024 as clients focus on productivity improvements and customer experience. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. \n I will now provide some details on the execution of our strategy around hybrid cloud and AI. \n Enterprise AI continues to gain traction. This year, we anticipate more clients moving from experimenting to deploying AI at scale to unlock productivity. We are pleased with the solid progress of our AI offerings. Each quarter, we are winning more clients, expanding partnerships and introducing new innovations. \n Inception to date, our book of business related to watsonx and generative AI is greater than $1 billion with sequential quarter-over-quarter growth. Similar to last quarter, this remains weighted towards Consulting. \n We believe our comprehensive AI strategy is well positioned to help clients scale AI. We developed our watsonx platform for clients to build their AI solutions, spanning from foundation model training to data preparation and governance. This includes both IBM/Red Hat models and third-party models, giving our clients variety as well as efficiency and focus on enterprise domains that IBM brings. \n We have leveraged watsonx to build AI assistance through our software portfolio. Our consultants are helping clients navigate the AI landscape. And finally, we are seeing our infrastructure segment play a larger role as clients leverage their hardware investments in their AI strategies. Let me touch on these infrastructure dynamics briefly. \n As AI becomes widely adopted, IBM Z is uniquely advantaged. We believe a lot of AI inferencing will happen where the data is for security, efficiency and latency reasons. Our full-stack focus, from on-chip AI processing to AI accelerator cards, to watsonx platform support, allows models to be built and trained on any platform and easily deployed on IBM Z. \n The Telum chip is a unique differentiator, enabling real-time AI inferencing. Generative AI is also driving lift for our storage offerings where industry-leading performance and scalability is utilized for data curation, model building and fine-tuning. \n For enterprises to deploy AI at scale, AI is not a one-size-fits-all proposition. It requires tuned, domain-specific models trained with quality data to maximize its impact. Clients value the flexibility of our approach. They appreciate having the ability to leverage a combination of AI models, whether they're IBMs; their own models; open source models, such as Llama from Meta and Mixtral from Mistral. And they can deploy these AI models across multiple environments. The flexibility we offer is resonating as our use cases are both large and more efficient models. \n We are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills. Let me spend a minute on our progress in this area. \n We see early parallels to Linux in making open source AI models performant for enterprise use. We believe that IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open source AI. As you know, we have done a lot of work with AI models and recently released a family of state-of-the-art open source code models from our Granite series. Red Hat and IBM also recently launched Instruct Lab to evolve and improve AI models through incremental community contributions, much like open source software. This open strategy is resonating around the world. We recently announced a collaboration with the Spanish government to leverage IBM's investments across their entire AI stack and open source to build the world's leading suite of foundation models proficient in the Spanish language. \n Enterprise use cases addressing code modernization, customer service and digital labor remain top of mind for our clients. This quarter, we signed a multiyear contract with Providence Health to reimagine talent and HR workflows with AI from IBM and partners. We're also providing data-driven insights and enabling Spanish language narration for this year's Masters golf tournament. \n Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth. This quarter, we progressed strategic partnerships with a number of industry leaders. Consulting joined forces with NVIDIA to accelerate clients' AI journeys. ServiceNow will embed watsonx AI capabilities into the ServiceNow platform to accelerate enterprise digital transformation. We also expanded our relationship with Adobe around OpenShift and watsonx as it relates to the Adobe Experience Platform. \n We continue to invest in emerging technology as well, bringing new innovations to the market. Since we put the world's first Quantum system on the cloud in 2016, we have deployed over 80 Quantum systems, and our users have run over 3 trillion programs to date. We just installed a Quantum System One at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. This is the first IBM Quantum system on a college campus anywhere in the world. This installation will advance research in critical areas such as energy storage, material science and financial modeling. \n As always, focusing on our portfolio remains a key priority. We closed the sale of The Weather Company in the first quarter and expect to close the announced acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG by midyear. \n Overall, we had a positive start to the year, which gives us confidence in our next quarter and full year expectations. \n Jim will now take you through the details of the quarter. Jim, over to you. Thanks, Wamsi. So let me address your thought about the demand profile globally. So if I look at where we are right now and where we project for the rest of the year, demand is actually quite strong. I would put it as very similar to 2023. This is backed up by IMF GDP estimates, which are now north of 3% for the global business.\n If I look at it by geography, Japan remains very strong. I think that they are taking this opportunity to refresh the technology across their enterprise and government base. If you look at South Asia, extremely strong; even the Middle East, U.A.E., Saudi, very strong; Europe has remained consistent to last year; North and South America. So on a geography basis, we're seeing very, very strong demand. \n Now interest rates are higher than people were expecting. I think we should acknowledge that. That means you get two effects going on. One, there is even stronger demand for software and infrastructure because people believe technology helps you in those environments and helps in an environment of increased labor costs and increased supply chain costs. Then when you look at the discretionary side, Jim answered this in the previous question, we are seeing a little bit, not across the board, not in all of the offerings in consulting, but where there is a little bit of discretionary labor, that is where we sense that pressure. \n What we are going to do is pivot into the areas around helping people become more productive, take more cost out, digital transformation, work with our partners where there is very strong demand in the market. And as you pivot there, we believe that our growth rate in Consulting will continue to accelerate. \n So I hope, Wamsi, that, that gave you a flavor on the demand vectors we have, both in Software and Infrastructure and in Consulting and on a geography basis. \n Jim, over to you for part 2. Ben, let me take the first part of those questions. We are very, very pleased with Red Hat. If I look at Red Hat now, we have had mid-teens or better bookings growth for the last 3 quarters, third quarter, fourth quarter and first quarter. That, combined with the growth we are seeing in OpenShift as well as in both Ansible and RHEL, OpenShift growing almost 40%, gives us a lot of confidence. So bookings growth plus OpenShift plus what we're seeing in the revenue now at 9% tells us that we should see that Red Hat growth continue or accelerate through the year. \n Two, let me just address the macro point. Hashi is a nice add for the Red Hat portfolio. But it's not inside Red Hat, let's just be clear. So when we talk about Red Hat growth numbers in line and accelerating, that is Red Hat as is. Hashi will be measured in software, but in IBM software, not in Red Hat. Where the synergy comes is, we believe, there will be added demand because if a combined portfolio is more interesting, we think even more clients will talk to us. That is how Hashi will help Red Hat. It's not that the Hashi revenue counts at all for the numbers we just mentioned. So we kind of want to be clear on that. \n Hashi to us is an accelerant for IBM strategy and for software strategy, and Hashi helps in being offensive in terms of giving us an overall better portfolio. So even more clients want to do business with us in the environments they're going to. That's kind of how I'd pitch it. And people know Hashi really well for their infrastructure management, but the security pieces of Hashi are also very, very interesting and really important as people navigate these very complex environments with all the worries about people losing secrets and keys and that resulting ransomware or hacking attacks. And that's kind of how I would paint the picture on that side. Erik, let me just maybe address the macro points on it, and I'll let Jim talk to some of the numbers here. We are going to remain incredibly disciplined on our M&A strategy. We kind of said it, but I just want to repeat, we've got to find things that meet our strategy, we've got to have some synergy opportunities at IBM, and it has to be financially accretive within the second year. So if we find things that meet that and we are committed, I'll say, to both our dividend and our investment-grade ratings, then that is kind of the picture we go in. Now within that, we believe we have some level of flexibility and that is what we will operate in. So that gives you a sense there. \n By the way, while we've got these 2 yet to come, we've got Software AG that we hope to close midyear and HashiCorp which will come near the end of the year, we also have to look at what is our overall internal dynamics of making sure that we can succeed on these businesses as we proceed down the path. We need to build consulting practices. We need to have synergy plays in other parts of the portfolio. We have to enable our sales teams globally. As we say, a big part of our synergy is getting the amplification from our global footprint that is there with clients all around the world. Jim? So Brent, as you can imagine, we are very, very focused on that question. If I just want to lay out a 4-year trajectory, if you'll indulge me with just a minute, we began with a software portfolio that was, let's call it, flat, it would be a kind way of putting it, about 5 years ago. We've gone from flat to, as you said, some volatility. But we are now seeing that we can be north of 6% for this year, whether you want to call that 6.5% or 7%, and we are very confident in that. As we do organic innovation and as we do M&A, we will find that, that number will keep improving year-over-year. And I'm pointing to a very consistent 4-year trajectory of having achieved that. \n By the way, within that, we do find there are a couple of slower growing pieces, but they're incredibly important to our overall profile, both for incumbency with clients and for the cash flow that we produce. We would never expect our mainframe software, the TPS piece, to be growing in the high-single digits or in double digits. So as that mix also changes over time, then we find that we're going to get closer and closer. And we do want to, over time, get software to grow above where we are right now. So right now, we are at the upper end of the mid-single-digit model. I think you can conclude what would be the next step we will go at, and then we'll go from there. Brian, great question. So let me talk to some of the Red Hat dynamics. It's not so much directly related to VMware per se, but clients are all beginning to say, they're asking the question, which is the platform they want to bet on for the next 10 to 20 years on which they will write their applications, deploy them both in their own data centers and on public cloud. We find an incredible amount of interest in that question. And as we have built out the Red Hat portfolio not just for containers, because many people know OpenShift as a great container platform, but also for virtualization with both container-native virtualization and with the KVM hypervisor, we are finding a lot of interest around those topics. \n Then as we layer in, by the end of the year, the HashiCorp advantages of managing the infrastructure across all these environments, we do believe that, that will be an accelerant to the Red Hat portfolio. So first, RHEL has got its place as the primary place where people want to deploy, OpenShift as a platform for both containers and virtualization, Ansible and HashiCorp helping increase automation and reduce the complexity. We think all of this plays in. And Brian, I think the best number is the mid-teens bookings growth on the subscription side of the business. That speaks to the demand in terms of not only is there demand but we are realizing that demand in the book of business that we are getting clients to commit to on Red Hat. I think, Matt, that's a great question. So let me maybe take that, and I'll address it from both the consulting side and the software side. If we look 12 months ago, I would say that there was a lot of excitement and there was a lot of experimentation that we're starting, and people were not thinking through what does this mean for my overall ROI, what are the economics of running gen AI, how do I get the people changes done so that the ROI can actually be realized. \n What is happening in all of my conversations this year, in the first quarter of 2024, is a lot of people have woken up that those issues need to be addressed as well. So when they talk to our consulting team, they are spending energy on, but can you help my people also do the transformation it takes, what is the change process through which you can recognize those things. They then go to immediately asking, in these models, how expensive is it to run them. And they begin to do the math, wait, if I run this model just for this one business process, the infrastructure costs alone could be $300 million a year. That doesn't close the ROI, can I do it in a much more cost-effective way but an equally good answer, and that is where you begin to see some of the models that IBM has produced. Our Granite series play very strongly into helping them recognize their ROI by reducing the economics. \n And then lastly, and this is advice that I gave to the C-suite usually, and it resonates, don't take lots of little experiments, try to pick a few use cases which can scale. And by scale, meaning that they actually do impact a large fraction of their employees or their clients' customers and they begin to have a large impact in how business is done by either improving revenue or by making the enterprise significantly more productive. That's kind of a conversation shift from simply, oh, this is a neat new tool, let me try out to see what I can do, not what I should do, but what I can do. And I think that, that is a big change in terms of helping the organization scale. \n So let me now wrap up the call. In the first quarter of 2024, we have executed on our strategy to deliver revenue growth and cash generation, allowing us to invest organically and through strategic acquisitions like HashiCorp. As always, we need to execute to capture the opportunity in front of us. I look forward to sharing our progress with you as we move through the rest of the year."

            "name": "James Kavanaugh",
            "content": "Thank you, Arvind. Let me start with the details of the transaction. We have agreed to acquire HashiCorp for $6.4 billion in enterprise value to be funded by cash on hand. The transaction was approved by HashiCorp's Board of Directors. Closing is anticipated by the end of 2024, subject to approval by HashiCorp's shareholders, regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. \n We have been executing a disciplined capital allocation strategy, and the acquisition of HashiCorp meets all of our criteria, including strategic fit, as Arvind just walked through, synergies across IBM and financial accretion. \n Let me start by addressing synergies. We see multiple drivers of product synergies within IBM and accelerating growth for HashiCorp. Product synergies span across multiple strategic growth areas for IBM, including Red Hat, watsonx, data security, IT automation and consulting. For example, the powerful combination of Red Hat's Ansible automation platforms configuration management and Terraform's automation will simplify provisioning and configuration of applications across hybrid cloud environments. \n We are well positioned to drive growth for HashiCorp by leveraging IBM's enterprise incumbency and global reach. With 70% of the revenue today coming from the U.S., the opportunity to scale HashiCorp across IBM's operations in 175 countries is significant. \n We also believe we can accelerate HashiCorp's adoption with IBM clients. To put this in perspective, only about 20% of the Forbes Global 2000 are HashiCorp customers and just 25% of HashiCorp customers result in more than $100,000 annual recurring revenue, underscoring the opportunity to better monetize and upsell their products. \n Bringing it all together, the acquisition allows us to deliver a more comprehensive hybrid cloud offering to enterprise clients, enhancing IBM's ability to capture global cloud opportunity. This will drive a higher growth profile over time. \n Finally, we expect to realize operating efficiencies and expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted EBITDA within the first full year post close and to free cash flow in year 2. Significant near-term cost synergies underpin the financial profile of the transaction, while product synergies represent further upside. We are very comfortable with our strong balance sheet, liquidity profile and solid investment-grade rating and remain committed to our dividend policy. \n I'll now turn it back to Arvind. Thanks, Arvind. In the first quarter, we delivered $14.5 billion in revenue; $3 billion of adjusted EBITDA; $1.7 billion of operating pretax income; $1.68 operating earnings per share; and we generated free cash flow of $1.9 billion, up approximately $600 million year-over-year. \n Our revenue for the quarter was up 3% at constant currency. We saw an impact to our top line performance from the closing of The Weather Company earlier than expected in the quarter. \n Software grew by 6% with growth across Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing and continued strength in our recurring revenue base. \n Consulting was up 2%, reflecting organic growth. We continue to have solid signings performance and a trailing 12-month book-to-bill of over 1.15. \n Infrastructure had strong performance, delivering growth across all of our hardware offerings. \n Looking at our profit metrics, we expanded operating gross margin by 100 basis points and operating pretax margin by 130 basis points over last year, inclusive of about 100 basis point currency headwind to pretax margin. \n At the end of January, we closed on the divestiture of The Weather Company, generating a pretax gain of $241 million in the quarter. Mitigating that benefit, we took charges of $374 million to address workforce rebalancing. \n Operating pretax margin was up 50 basis points, excluding the year-over-year impacts of workforce rebalancing and divestiture dynamics. We are pleased with this performance, in line with our guidance of roughly 50 basis points of operating pretax margin improvement in 2024. \n Margin expansion was driven by our operating leverage, product mix and ongoing productivity initiatives. This allows for continued investments to drive innovation, which you can see in our higher R&D expense. The timing of discrete tax items this quarter resulted in an operating tax rate of about 6%. We are still expecting a full year operating tax rate consistent with last year. \n Overall, the combination of our revenue and operating margin performance resulted in 7% growth in our adjusted EBITDA. This contributed to our free cash flow performance. For the quarter, we generated $1.9 billion of free cash flow, up $600 million year-over-year. This growth reflects the performance of our underlying business, with adjusted EBITDA up $200 million year-over-year and about $400 million from timing of balance sheet dynamics and CapEx. \n Over the last 12 months, we generated free cash flow of $11.8 billion. This puts us on track to deliver about $12 billion of free cash flow for the year, with the growth largely driven by adjusted EBITDA. \n Since our acquisition of Red Hat, excluding 2021 when we spun off Kyndryl, our operating net income to free cash flow realization averaged 120%. Two factors drive this. One is stock-based compensation, which today represents 15 points of realization. And two, given the shift in our portfolio to a growing software business, deferred income also contributes to our realization. \n In terms of cash uses, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends. From a balance sheet perspective, we have a very strong liquidity position with cash of $19.3 billion, up from $13.5 billion at year-end 2023. Our debt balance at the end of the first quarter was $59.5 billion, including $9.9 billion from our financing business. \n Turning to the segments. Software revenue grew 6% with good performance across both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. As mentioned in January, the Software revenue growth drivers for the year include Red Hat growth, acquisitions, strong recurring revenue and transaction processing. And this is just how the first quarter played out. Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue was up 7%. Let me spend a minute on the various elements. \n Red Hat revenue grew 9%, reflecting solid performance across the 3 key solutions: RHEL, OpenShift and Ansible. Annual bookings growth was again in the mid-teens, with OpenShift up over 40% this quarter and RHEL and Ansible each up double digits. \n Beyond Red Hat, recent acquisitions contributed to the growth profile of Hybrid Platform & Solutions as did new innovation areas, including watsonx. The combination of Apptio, acquired mid-last year, and our IT automation portfolio has delivered strong results, unlocking the full benefits of a fin op solution for technology investments across hybrid cloud environments. In fact, just this quarter, we partnered with Microsoft to bring Apptio to Azure and we'll co-sell to our joint customers, and Microsoft has agreed to adopt Apptio's capabilities in parts of their organization. \n Our revenue performance continues to reflect growth in our high-value recurring revenue base. Our ARR, after removing The Weather Company and security services, is now $13.9 billion, up over 8% since last year. \n Transaction Processing, with its strong base of recurring revenue, delivered revenue growth of 4%. Clients continue to value this portfolio of mission-critical software, supporting growing workloads on our hardware platforms. And there's an increasing interest in generative AI application modernization capabilities, like watsonx Code Assistant for Z. \n Software segment profit was up 80 basis points while absorbing both key investments in innovation and about 1 point of currency impact in the quarter. We continue to deliver operating leverage driven by our revenue performance this quarter. \n Our Consulting revenue was up 2%. We continue to see clients prioritizing large data and technology transformation projects focused on driving productivity with AI and analytics. These results reflect the organic performance of our business. \n Solid demand for our offerings led to signings growth of 4%, our highest absolute first quarter signings in recent history, and our trailing 12-month book-to-bill ratio remains over 1.15. \n Our overall backlog remains healthy, up 7% year-over-year, and backlog erosion levels remain stable. At the same time, we saw both a lengthening of backlog duration driven by large-scale digital transformations and a reduced level of revenue realization in the quarter as clients tightened discretionary spending. \n Contributing to growth across the business this quarter, our strategic partnerships continue to make up over 40% of our Consulting revenue, with both AWS and Azure practices growing double digits. Additionally, our Red Hat practice grew revenue double digits. Expanding upon our partnerships, we are leveraging Microsoft Copilot to drive productivity for our clients. Just as we quickly ramped a meaningful book of business around Red Hat to address the hybrid cloud opportunity, we are ahead of pace at this stage with our generative AI book of business. \n Turning to our lines of business. Business Transformation revenue grew 3% led by supply chain and finance transformations. Customer experience transformations also contributed to growth. \n Technology Consulting revenue was also up 3% with double-digit growth in cloud modernization projects, and both strategic partnerships and Red Hat engagements delivered double-digit growth. \n Application Operations revenue declined, reflecting weakness in on-prem custom application management projects, partially offset by strength in cloud-based application management offerings. \n Moving to Consulting profit. We delivered over 8% of segment profit margin, which is flat year-to-year. Our segment profit margin was impacted by about 1 point of currency, offsetting improvements in pricing and productivity actions we have taken. \n Moving to Infrastructure. Revenue grew, reflecting growth in Hybrid Infrastructure of 6% and declines in Infrastructure Support of 7%. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, growth was broad-based with strong demand from our hardware offerings across IBM Z, Power and Storage. \n In IBM Z, revenue was up 5% in the eighth quarter of z16 product availability. Now 2 years in, this product cycle continues to resonate with clients and surpassed z15 revenue performance. IBM Z is uniquely positioned for AI with the first processor design with on-chip acceleration for real-time AI inferencing. In fact, we're working with over 100 clients on the application of AI on z16. Use cases range from fraud detection to anti-money laundering, to anomaly detection. This remains an enduring platform, driving not just hardware adoption but also related software, storage and services. \n Distributed Infrastructure delivered 7% revenue growth with strength in both Power and Storage. Power performance was fueled by demand for data-intensive workloads. Storage delivered strong double-digit revenue growth, including demand for high-end storage tied to the Z16 cycle. And clients are also looking to our storage offerings for data curation, model building and fine-tuning and support of generative AI. \n Looking at Infrastructure profit. We delivered both gross profit and segment profit margin expansion. Segment profit margin expanded 20 basis points in the quarter, reflecting benefits from productivity while absorbing about 1 point of impact from currency. \n Now let me bring it back to the IBM level to wrap up. More than 2 years into our midterm model, we are a more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue and free cash flow growth. Over this time, we've continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and drive productivity across our business. \n Our first quarter performance is another proof point of this progress with constant currency revenue growth, operating gross margin and operating pretax margin expansion, and the strongest first quarter free cash flow in many years. \n Looking to the full year 2024, we are holding our view on our 2 primary metrics: revenue and free cash flow. We see full year constant currency revenue growth in line with our mid-single-digit model, still prudently at the low end. And for free cash flow, we expect to generate about $12 billion driven primarily by growth in adjusted EBITDA. \n On the segments. In Software, we had a solid start to the year and continue to expect growth slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. In Consulting, we continue to see strong demand for digital transformations. Though, as I said, we are seeing some pressure on smaller, more discretionary projects. We now see mid-single-digit revenue growth in Consulting with acceleration throughout the year. Given our ongoing productivity initiatives and investment in innovation, we expect to see about 1 point of segment profit margin expansion in both of these segments. And in Infrastructure, given product cycle dynamics, we expect revenue to decline, driving about a 0.5 point impact to our overall growth. \n Given IBM Z cycle dynamics, we expect segment profit margin to be lower year-over-year. With these segment dynamics, we continue to expect IBM's operating pretax margin to expand by about 0.5 point year-to-year, consistent with our view 90 days ago, and we are maintaining our view of operating tax for the year to be consistent with last year, in the mid-teens range. \n We took a workforce rebalancing charge this quarter. And as I mentioned 90 days ago, we continue to see the overall amount this year consistent with last year. We expect this to pay back by the end of the year. \n On currency, given the strengthening of the dollar, we now expect a 150 to 200 basis point impact to revenue growth for the year, which is about 1 point worse than 90 days ago. \n For the second quarter, I expect our constant currency revenue growth rate to be consistent with the full year. Our tax rate is expected to be in the high teens. And for profit, we expect the first half skew of net income will remain a couple of points ahead of the prior year. \n In closing, we are pleased with our performance to start the quarter. We are positioned to grow revenue, expand operating profit margin and grow free cash flow for the year. \n Arvind and I are now happy to take your questions. Olympia, let's get started. Thanks, Amit. I appreciate the question. Let's take a step back because I think you're seeing some interesting dynamics in the consulting industry overall. And let's bifurcate it between how you asked the question. Let's look at real demand that's being measured in bookings, and then let's talk about what's happening with the revenue realization. \n On demand, we continue to see and capitalize on solid demand in key areas around digital transformation, application modernization and Gen AI. Our signings in the quarter, up 4%, the strongest absolute first quarter signings we've had as far back as I can go. We have a strong book-to-bill, over 1.15 on a trailing 12 months. Our backlog dynamic is in a very strong position, 7% overall with stable erosion, but our duration has been going up the last 2 quarters. It's been up a couple of months. \n But let's talk about the underpinnings of what's driving demand because I think that's what's most important around the key growth focus areas. You talked about Gen AI. Gen AI for IBM, Arvind indicated, inception to date, over a $1 billion book of business. Consulting in the first quarter, the book of business on Gen AI was 2x all of last year, so I think we're winning in the marketplace. We're taking share. And by the way, we're well above that ramp we saw with regards to Red Hat. \n Our strategic partnerships still have great velocity, book-to-bill well north of 1.2. Our Red Hat book business is now $2.8 billion ARR around hybrid cloud. And we're seeing very nice acceleration in Gen AI and digital transformation around core workflow use case areas of finance, supply chain, HR and talent. So I think in the key focus areas, is our demand profile still continues to be good. \n Now let's translate that to revenue. Revenue, first of all, in the first quarter, as we indicated, it was all organic. We ramped on our acquisitions. We continue to operate a very disciplined M&A process and we continue to be opportunistic, but that 2% revenue growth was all organic quarter-to-quarter. Second, in this marketplace, you look at competition, we're taking share still. \n So when you look at it, 90 days ago, we talked about the year. We talked about the year was going to play out accelerating throughout the year. Why? Because, one, we knew we had a strong backlog and that backlog realization showed us that it was going to play out throughout the year with sequential improvement. But second, Easter. Easter, we knew calendar was there, it was at the end of March. That does impact a human capital-based business on a number of billing days. \n So when you look then at first quarter, that backlog duration extending out a couple of months. We also saw, though, less revenue backlog yield, and that really played out if you look at our subsegments, in Application Operations. That's centered around custom AMS applications which, by the way, many of that, as you know quite well, is volume-based business. And that volume, like I said, backlog is stable overall. We're not losing the business. That is moving out to the right. \n So with all that said, what are we focused on? We're focused on capturing new client demand in areas around our key growth areas. Two, we're continuing to focus and we are gaining share in the marketplace. Three, we're driving that economic multiplier of consulting and technology across our hybrid cloud and AI platform. \n So in light of all that, that's why you see the mid-single-digit growth. I think that's prudent just given what every other consulting competitors come out with. By the way, that still drives 1.5 points of growth to IBM for the full year. And as I stated earlier, we see an accelerated growth profile as we move through the year. Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Wamsi, for the question. As Arvind indicated in the prepared remarks, we couldn't be more excited about the powerful combination of HashiCorp with IBM and Red Hat together. We talked about it in the prepared remarks, we've been very disciplined in our set of criteria around M&A. And this fits strategically. It has tremendous synergistic value to our hybrid cloud and AI portfolio and it has an attractive financial return overall. \n And Hashi meets all three: One, it's a higher revenue growth profile company, so it accelerates IBM's revenue growth over time; two, to your question, adjusted EBITDA accretive in the first 12 months; and three, levered free cash flow accretive by the end of year 2. We think there are a potential for meaningful synergies overall and, when we look at it, significant near-term operating efficiencies, cost synergies. And to put that in perspective, we see this business profile moving from about a mid-single-digit free cash flow margin business to about a 30% to 40% free cash flow margin business in a handful of years, free cash flow accretive by the end of year 2. \n Now the multiple we paid on that, fully supported by, one, the stand-alone revenue growth and the cost synergies that come out. All of the IBM revenue synergies around Red Hat, around data security, around watsonx, around consulting and IT automation are all upside potential. \n So let's talk and conclude on the cost synergy. Cost synergies are where you would fully expect. IBM runs a global operations in 175 countries. We run a very disciplined G&A-efficient structure. We see significant G&A operating efficiencies that we're going to go capitalize on. Second, running the playbook on how we expand it globally, our go-to-market model that we did with Red Hat, and that has both global incumbency, global scale, global breadth and ecosystem leverage overall. And when you look at that, those significant synergies allow us to invest in product, R&D, innovation and capability that's built into our case and also deliver our financial returns, so we feel pretty good about it. Okay, Toni. Many questions here, let me see if I can get through them quick. You look at full year, full year, as Arvind indicated, we're maintaining our guidance on our model mid-single digit, I think, prudently just coming out of a first quarter. We've got a lot of work to do in the next 3 quarters, but I think prudently, at the low end of that model. By the way, that was very consistent with what we said 90 days ago. \n Now let's unpack that. When you take a look at full year, first of all, we are dealing with a stronger U.S. dollar. So we've given you supplemental chart, now we've lost basically about 1 point more of headwind on currency. \n Well, let's talk about the underlying fundamentals of our business across our segments because I think that's at the heart of your question. When you take a look at our growth at mid-single digit, one, we said software would grow slightly above the high end of our mid-single-digit model. We are very pleased with our Software performance in the first quarter. We've accelerated growth from fourth quarter to 6% overall. We have a very strong recurring revenue base. We accelerated Red Hat to a very strong 9% with our third consecutive quarter of mid-teen booking growth, which positions our business extremely well for double-digit growth for the full year, and we're getting nice scale and leverage on acquisitions. \n Software for the year will deliver over 3 points of that IBM mid-single digit by itself. Based on that Red Hat momentum, acquisitions, solid recurring revenue; TP, by the way, nice start, up 4%; and new innovation like watsonx. Consulting, we said for the full year, appropriately, in light of the market and still gaining share, would be mid-single digits. That will deliver about 1.5 points of growth to IBM. Why did we feel good about that? One, solid book-to-bill, winning in key focus areas, strategic partnerships, Gen AI scale overall. But like first quarter, we're going to continue to monitor that backlog realization to see how that plays out. \n But between Software and Consulting, over 3 points in Software, about 1.5 points, now you get to Infrastructure. We started out well above what we expected here in the first quarter. Mainframe, eighth quarter in, grew 5%. Our Distributed Infrastructure, Power and Storage, both grew double digits as we're capitalizing on Distributed Infrastructure and demand requirements for Gen AI. Full year, that's a little bit better than what we thought 90 days ago off our first start, so we expect about a little bit less than 0.5 point impact to IBM. You throw on top of that, we executed the closure of The Weather Company, that would be about 0.5 point. So that's kind of how we build up our full year overall. \n So AI book of business, I think you nailed it in your question. It's, one, on a Consulting perspective, it's our signings book of business overall. And on our Software, it's our subscription, our SaaS and perpetual licenses. Again, as you know, we offer clients flexibility on how they want to purchase that overall. \n And Consulting backlog, yes, 5% overall. I would tell you, let's put it in perspective, it's probably mid- to high single digits. But we've got, give or take, about a $30 billion book of business on backlog with Consulting. So coming from where we started, less than 9 months ago, I think that's a very good ramp. And let's put it in perspective. When we drove the hybrid cloud platform-centric play with Consulting, which has done extremely well, over the first 4 quarters, we did a $1 billion book of business. Right now, through less than 3 quarters, we're very damn close to that $1 billion book of business. Yes, I would just add one other point, Ben. As you and I and many of the investors have talked about since first quarter earnings, we've kind of bifurcated this business when we saw the slowdown happen in second half last year between our subscription-based business within Red Hat versus our consumption-based services and offerings, the former being about 80% of our portfolio, the latter being about 20%. \n If you look at first quarter, as Arvind indicated, we're very pleased. Coming off of a 2-plus point acceleration positions us extremely well, even more confident in that double-digit for the year. But the reason why we're even more confident is that 80% of that portfolio, that subscription business, we accelerated 3 points quarter-to-quarter in revenue and we were above double digits. \n On the consumption base, we finally saw a stabilization. We didn't see acceleration, we saw stabilization. But remember, we start ramping on that in the second half, so that provides us a tailwind in the second half. But our subscription business today, the 80%, 3 points acceleration, double-digit in the first quarter, all 3 major lines broad-based double-digit bookings; Red Hat OpenShift, over 40% booking strength; $1.3 billion ARR book of business, growing 25-plus percent; Ansible taking share, we feel even more confident as I said. Yes. Arvind, just building on your point, we are very confident in the capital structure of this company. We are committed to maintain a very solid investment-grade balance sheet. We are focused on debt leverage, obviously. But our primary capital allocation is to invest in our business, both organically and inorganically, and to maintain an attractive return to shareholder program with our dividend policy. So with all that said, just to reaffirm what Arvind indicated, we will remain in the market prudently evaluating complementary tuck-in opportunities that fit our M&A strategy, and we got the capability of doing that."
