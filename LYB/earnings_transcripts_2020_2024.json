Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. \nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator. Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's fourth quarter 2020 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 PM Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling 800-846-0305 in the United States and 402-998-0543 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 6541. During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before I turn the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last-in first-out LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. During the fourth quarter, we recognized pre-tax LCM benefits totaling $147 million compared to LCM charges of $163 million during the first nine months of 2020. During the third quarter, we recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $582 million related to our Houston Refinery. Comments made on the call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments.\nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. Let's turn to Slide 3. 2020 was unlike anything we have ever seen or experienced, oil price volatility, a global pandemic and an associated recession. To call this year unprecedented would be an understatement. So before we get into the results today, I want to take a few minutes to provide some context around our approach to navigating the past year, because I think it speaks well to who we are as a company and the character and talent of our team. Early in the year, as it became clear that the virus is becoming more widespread, our leadership team established three guiding principles for the short term; number one, protect our employees and communities; two, keep our commitments to our investors; and three, take actions to strengthen the company for the future. In past earnings calls, I've talked about some attributes of our culture; operational and commercial excellence, cost management and capital discipline. These qualities served us particularly well during 2020 as we bolstered liquidity by rapidly accessing capital markets, minimizing working capital and efficiently generating cash. Importantly, we honored our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating and continue to fund dividends and capital investments with cash from operations. As we review our results today, I hope the outcome of these priorities and the benefits of this culture will be clear. Beyond the strategy itself, I also want to take a moment to acknowledge our global team that delivered our results. These individuals, both those who were able to work remotely and those who continue to work on the front lines at our manufacturing sites form a strong and nimble team. They have my sincere and deepest gratitude. If the pandemic reinforced anything, it is the value of our products and industry in serving modern society's needs. Knowing that the materials produced by our plants go into end products like face masks, medical gowns and COVID-19 test kits, our team took immediate action to ensure our manufacturing sites would continue to supply our customers, while prioritizing the safety of our workforce. I'm very proud to say that not only did we continue to operate reliably, but to date there have been no cases of workplace virus transmission among our employees.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of improving cash conversion. The benefit of efficient cash conversion becomes more apparent during periods of economic downturns when liquidity provides defense against risk from volatility and uncertainty. Over the past year LyondellBasell converted 88% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. As a result of the challenging market dynamics in 2020, our business teams took aggressive actions in managing inventories to drive free cash flow and maximize liquidity to release more than $300 million of cash from working capital. We are pleased to report that despite the downturn, we've fully funded $1.4 billion in dividends and our $1.9 billion capital investment program through cash generated from operating activities in 2020. The $4.20 per share of dividends paid by our company during the year extends LyondellBasell's track record of consistently paying and increasing our base dividend over the past 10 years. Let's continue to Slide 8 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment throughout the year. As you can see, we increased the amount of cash in our balance sheet by approximately $1.4 billion during 2020, to end the year with $2.5 billion in cash and liquid investments. Cash from operations fully funded a small amount of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 as well as the full year's dividends and capital expenditures. In 2020, we accessed very attractive debt capital markets to extend maturities of existing debt, fund acquisitions and bolster liquidity. These borrowings increased gross debt by $3.9 billion relative to the prior year. A portion of the new bonds funded the $470 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China, and the $2 billion acquisition of our 50% share of the Louisiana integrated polyethylene joint venture with Sasol. We incurred about $70 million in pre-tax cost due to our fourth quarter refinancing activities. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and available liquidity that enabled us to reduce the balance of our term loan by $500 million in January of 2021. We will continue to prioritize deleveraging over the course of this year, which should allow us to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet.\nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10, which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the past five quarters. Unlike a typical year where LyondellBasell's business portfolio would follow a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring midyear, the pattern seen in 2020 are reversed with higher profitability in the first and fourth quarters. The rebound in profitability since the second quarter has been remarkable as the global economy proceeds on a path to recovery. EBITDA in the final quarter of 2020 was $1.3 billion, the highest for any fourth quarter since 2017, and more than $375 million higher than the prior quarter. The trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter. Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments served strong consumer-driven demand for packaging and non-durable products throughout the year, while our Intermediates and Derivatives and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments benefited from improving industrial sector demand for durable goods during the second half of the year. We have only seen modest recovery in the demand for transportation fuels. Our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses continued to experience headwinds from excess capacity and slack demand due to persistently low global mobility. While we would naturally prefer to see strength in all of the markets we serve, the geographic and end-market diversity of our product portfolio continues to provide offsets that help to dampen business cycles. Let's turn to Slide 11, and look at the latest thoughts from consultants on the global polyethylene business cycle. Industry consultants have forecasted that capacity additions, especially in China, could outpace global demand over the next four years. These predictions seem reminisce in the forecast from consulting reports published in 2016 depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would get due to the capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate depicted by the solid line demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious timelines and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted. In addition to delays in capacity additions, we believe recent forecast underestimate growth in demand. Early in the pandemic many predicted declines in PV demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecast improved to flat demand, most consultants now believe that global PV demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rate seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecast to 4% demand growth for both 2020 and 2021 results in a predicted operating rate depicted in the dotted gray line. If 2021 follows pattern seen after prior recessions and demand growth rebounds to levels higher than 4%, then operating rates would accordingly move upward. Our rebounding economy that increases 2021 global polyethylene demand by 7% followed by a reversion to consultant forecast of 4% growth thereafter would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line. In summary, we believe the next wave of capacity additions will result in operating rates within the boundaries of a balanced market. The next wave of capacity additions will undoubtedly occur, but we believe that typical project delays, a few project cancellations and perhaps increased demand from a recovering economy could contribute to a more orderly absorption of the new capacity by the global markets. Let's review the fourth quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston Refinery. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 12. Fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA was $722 million, $318 million higher than the third quarter. Margins improved on higher pricing driven by higher demand for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefins results increased $185 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Margin improved on higher ethylene and propylene pricing. Volume increased with improved demand. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $65 million higher than the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. For the full year, results decreased by $514 million, margins declined for both Olefins and Polyolefins, driven by lower prices for Olefins co-products and polyethylene, despite lower feedstock costs. Lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic drove increases in demand for non-durable packaging and consumer goods providing strength in the polyethylene market and increased volumes for ethylene and polyethylene. Based on strong February orders, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $120 million compared to the third quarter. Improving demand for polyolefin and a full quarter of contribution from our Bora joint venture increased both polyolefin volumes and equity income. Olefins results were relatively unchanged with lower margins due to increased maintenance expense, partially offset by increased volume. Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million, driven by higher demand and volumes from our Bora joint venture. Equity income increased about $60 million with more than half of that improvement arising from Bora. Full year EBITDA was $236 million lower than 2019. Margins declined in both Olefins and Polyolefins due to lower polyolefin and ethylene prices outpacing lower feedstock costs. Polyolefin demand remained relatively stable with increased sales from the start-up of our Bora joint venture during the fourth quarter. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. Please turn to Slide 14. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $196 million, a decline of $49 million from the third quarter 2020. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products, driven by weaker gasoline demand and prices muted the margin improvement in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business. Fourth quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to significantly higher Asia propylene oxide pricing, driven by strong demand and tight markets supplies. Intermediate Chemicals results were relatively unchanged. Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased by approximately $10 million, a small volume improvements or more than offset by margin declines due to continued lower gasoline prices and higher butane feedstock costs. During 2020 EBITDA declined $714 million compared to 2019. Margin declined in most businesses, primarily in the Oxyfuels & Related Products and Intermediate Chemicals businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to lower demand, partially offset by increased Asia demand for our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives products. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect margins to be relatively flat as market tightness in Asia is alleviated by higher industry supply. Our volumes will be impacted during the first quarter due to planned maintenance at our Channelview propylene oxide and styrene monomer unit. Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $126 million, a $9 million increase over the third quarter 2020. Volumes increased with improved demand in the automotive sector partially offset by lower margins. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and Advanced Polymer businesses were relatively unchanged. Within our Compounding & Solutions business volumes increased as automotive manufacturers ramped up production. Margins declined as a result of product prices lagging price increases for propylene feedstocks. Full year EBITDA for the segment was $381 million, a $51 million decline over 2019. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from an $80 million reduction in integration costs. Volumes decline would significantly lower automotive, appliance and construction demand, partially offset by higher margins as a result of product mix. We expect continued recovery in industrial durable goods demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business during the spring. At our Investor Day in 2019, we announced an increased target of $200 million of synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition. We have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we are beginning to capture an annual run rate of more than $200 million, which will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Now let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery in durable goods demand is playing out in the polypropylene and compounds markets for our company on Slide 16. China's rapid response to control COVID transmission and stimulate industrial production resulted in strong demand growth despite the pandemic. Automotive production in China was up 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and China polypropylene demand for the full year 2020 increased by 10% over 2019. The strength in durable goods markets is also evident in LyondellBasell's metrics. Our polypropylene inventory levels hit all time lows in both North America and Europe on strong market demand. In North America, construction activities increased in the fourth quarter with a 5% year-over-year increase in demand for single-ply thermoplastic roofing materials that utilize our Catalloy advanced polymers. Looking at our own order books for polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy within the EPS segment a nice V-shaped recovery is shown in the chart where the forecast for January suggests the first quarter that is nearly the same level seen in the first quarter of 2019. Tight markets, low inventory and strong orders indicate that markets for polypropylene-based durable goods are showing strength going into the first quarter 2021. The increased demand for our polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy products should benefit the EPS segment in 2021. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $74 million, a $47 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and impairment of the Houston Refinery in the third quarter. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to lower fixed costs and improved margin capture Improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread were more than offset by increased costs for Renewable, Identification, Number of credits, or RINs. Similar to the prior period, we operate the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity to match with its demand with an average crude throughput of 214,000 barrels per day. Full-year EBITDA was negative $289 million, $224 million lower than 2019. Refining margins were compressed due to pandemic driven reductions in demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The Maya 2-1-1 spread was at a historically low point during the year and averaged $12.63 per barrel. 2020 crude throughput was limited to an average of 223,000 barrels per day as we actively managed operations to match the reduced market demand. Refining margins are expected to move sideways until demand for gasoline and jet fuel improves. We plan to continue operating the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. We remain diligent with efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at our Houston Refinery and we'll continue to evaluate production decisions as the market evolves. Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. EBITDA was $45 million during the fourth quarter and was $324 million for the full year. Fourth quarter Technology profitability declined due to a lower number of licensing revenue recognition milestones. Catalyst margins increased due to inventory mix improvements probably offset by decrease in volumes as customers managed year-end inventories. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones and improving catalyst demand, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability to improve to a similar level as in the first quarter of 2019. Please turn to Slide 19 for a refreshed view of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a clear and straightforward strategy to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation, while moderating our capital expenditure budget to $2 billion or less for each of the next three years. The formula is simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should improve free cash flow at any point in business cycles. Let me summarize the year's highlights and outlook with Slide 20. During 2020 LyondellBasell remained true to our strategy of capturing value and delivering resilient results at all points in the cycle. We delivered on our commitments to investors, served our customers and supported our employees, while moving forward on sustainability initiatives. By maximizing cash generation and prioritizing liquidity, we maintained our investment grade rating and extended the continuity of our dividend. Demand for consumer-driven goods remained strong and durable goods markets are rebounding with increased industrial activity. As global mobility improves, we expect that demand and margin for fuels from our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses will follow. Over the past several years LyondellBasell has captured opportunities through disciplined and profitable growth investments whether building, acquiring or partnering on assets. Our company focused on leveraging our technology, building on our advantages and increasing our earnings capacity. Our path is clear. LyondellBasell will remain focused on meeting our commitments and pursuing a disciplined financial strategy. With robust cash generation and ample liquidity, we plan to continue strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio during 2021. We look forward to sharing our progress toward developing more circular business models for our industry and creating a more supportive culture for our workforce that will allow all of us to continue delivering sustainable results for years to come. In summary, our strategy has served us well and now LyondellBasell is poised to emerge from this pandemic with more earnings power and free cash flow potential. We are now pleased to take your questions.\nDavid Kinney: Hello, Amanda, are you on mute?\nOperator: Can you hear me, sir?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, we can.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Steve Byrne. Your line is open.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you. On the topic of sustainability, I'm curious to hear your estimate of your - can you hear me okay?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. Yes. Go ahead. There is a bit of background noise. Amanda, perhaps this is on your side. Go ahead Steve.\nSteve Byrne: Okay. The - what fraction of your polyethylene volumes are sold in their end markets, where customers are asking for some type of a sustainable product? I'm curious to hear your view, whether this is a push by your initiatives or is this being pulled by the end market customers that you're selling into? And of that fraction, how would you split it into the three buckets that you're working in? You have the mechanical recycling JV with SUEZ, you have the pyrolysis molecular recycling project, and then you also have the bio-based feedstock project with Neste. Which of those three do you think are really driving us? Or do you think those end market customers are really above the line?\nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Steve. Good morning. First of all, in terms of how much of our polyethylene demand our customers are asking for sustainable products, I mean, if you think about our sales of polyethylene more than half of it goes in the packaging, whether it's flexible or blow molded bottles or those sorts of things. So I think it's safe to say more than half, probably close two thirds over time, we'll want to have sustainable products as part of the mix that we sell them. In terms of their preference, for food packaging, clearly, the molecular recycling would be the most desirable because essentially what we're doing is we're creating new feedstock and producing FDA approved resin. So our molecular recycling will be the most important development as we look at the next five to seven years, but I think mechanical recycling will continue to play a role. And that's where we're capturing the near-term opportunities. And as you know, we have a molecular recycling pilot plant that we built in Italy. We're working - I had a review with my R&D team, in fact, this week, and they are working diligently to perfect the technology and get to semi works as soon as possible.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort. Your line is open. Bob Koort, your line is open.\nBob Koort: Thanks very much. Bob, I was hoping you could give us an update on how the commercialization of your two new JVs is progressing, and maybe some milestones there?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, so good morning, Bob. Things are going very well. So I'll start with Bora. We have - we've stacked up in the marketing side, both sales and customer service. We have a full-fledged organization. Local leadership in China ramping up our marketing efforts to sell more directly rather than through trading activities. So we're selling 100% of the polymer output over there in Bora, and things are going quite well. I will tell you it's increased our visibility on the market and demand trends. And so all the things we thought would occur when we had a bigger presence. We're starting to see that. Sasol JV, we're operating the facility as part of the agreement. We have - the site manager is a LyondellBasell employee. He was a site manager of one of our sites here in Houston. The marketing of the products is just part of our usual marketing that we do on other polyethylene grades that we already producing. So my sense is that the integration has been very seamless. And both JVs are really now part of the system.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan. Your line is open.\nArun Viswanathan: All right. Thanks for taking my question. Good morning. I guess I just wanted to get your thoughts on, again the polyethylene market as well as the polypropylene markets. So in polyethylene, I guess, conditions have definitely held up a lot better than what lot of us had thought. And now with the durables, market kind of recovering. I guess, do you expect maybe a little bit of give back in Q2 as operating rates pick up, and we see little bit more supply coming to the market? Or do you expect kind of price resilience? And then in polypropylene, maybe similar questions we've seen a real surge in monomer. And so how does that kind of translate to your outlook for polymer pricing and margins downstream? Thanks.\nBhavesh Patel: Good morning, Arun. Both are very tight. So let me talk about polyethylene first. Speaking for ourselves and inventory is still very low. In fact, we're looking for opportunities to build back some inventory, but because demand is so strong, we're not able to do that. On the pricing front January price increase discussions are essentially finished and the implementation of the increase is going to occur. The next increase for February is on the table and likely there will be very good discussion about that as well. If you think about markets being tight in January, typically as we go into the spring, we see a seasonal uptick in demand. And so I think that supply-demand fundamentals are going to remain tight through the first half of the year for polyethylene. And polypropylene, similarly, as you said, propylene prices run up quite a lot. But inventories are still low, we're struggling to build inventory because demand is so good. And as you said about durables, probably applies more to polypropylene. As the economic recovery really takes hold in Europe and U.S., I think we're going to see probably more pool from durable goods end uses. So we're quite constructive of about both frankly. It looks tight through the first half of the year. And the other thing I would add is, there is quite a bit of downtime on - a planned downtime in the industry for crackers. So that's going to keep monomer prices probably high through the first half of the year. There is also a very large PDH turnaround here on the Gulf Coast. So that will keep propylene pretty strong through May, I would imagine.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews. Your line is open.\nVincent Andrews: Bob maybe just to follow up on the polyethylene demand. In one of the slides, the capacity utilization slide, you put the scenario out there where demand could grow 7% in 2021. And I'm just wondering if you could bridge us between the sort of 4% expectation and what would get it up to 7%. And within that, as a follow-up to one of your earlier comments on sort of expecting the normal seasonal improvement in demand in the second and third quarter, does the COVID environment minimize that at all with everybody at home, and what have you or do you think we'll still see the same seasonality in demand? Thanks.\nBhavesh Patel: Sure, Vincent. So, first of all, what we were trying to illustrate with that chart is that it won't take much for the operating rates to just go flat from here, 3% additional demand in one year. Now, typically in recovery years, we've seen demand growth above trend line in the first year or even two post recessions. To your question about how do you bridge the 4 to the 7, first of all, in polyethylene, here in the U.S. the pipe market has been very, very weak. And if there is an infrastructure bill as oil and gas starts to come back a bit, I think that could help demand growth here in the U.S. and likely if there's infrastructure spending in Europe in China, I mean you could really see that market contribute to bringing the 4 to 7. The other is --there still enough durable goods content or industrial demand or for example like industrial bulk containers. As industrial activity picks up, I think, we'll see recovery or higher demand rates for polyethylene. So I don't think it would take much to get to the 7%. And when you factor that in, it looks like operating rates could stay elevated through over the next few years.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison. Your line is open.\nMike Sison: Nice end of the year. Bob, it sounds like Schulman worked out really well, I guess, similar to our brands, so hopefully enjoyed the season. But are there any other opportunities for bolt-on acquisitions? Your balance sheet is in good shape, maybe to add to that advanced materials segment.\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So we are pleased with how the APS segment has really evolved. What I'm most pleased about is that the integration is essentially complete. And so now as we face into recovering markets, the increase in volume should increase earning will see those synergies go straight to the bottom line. And that's really ahead of us. So the best is in still in part of us for APS, hopefully the same for our brands. In terms of bolt-on acquisitions, yes, I mean, we're out - we now that the platform is essentially set. It would be very natural if we could find opportunities to bolt-on and add to the segments that are most attractive to us. So we're keeping a watchful eye for that and we'll keep you updated. But given the kind of acquisitions that are possible, the size will be very modest, and it will be more about just roll-ups.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy. Your line is open.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. Bob, with regards to propylene, the three explanations that we often hear for supply constraints are low refinery operating rates, PDH outages and a light feedstock mix yielding diminish quantities of propylene co-product. Can you speak to those and your view of the sustainability of this tightness in propylene monomer? It's not often we see prices rise $0.22 a pound over a two month period. And so I'm just curious to hear your view on that.\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, Kevin, it's kind of reminiscent of like 10 years ago when we used to see a lot more volatility, and generally when propylene gets close to being sold out any outage causes these kinds of burst in price. I would add a fourth item to your list, which is very robust demand for the derivatives of propylene, not just polypropylene, but the other propylene derivatives, cumene and derivatives and so on. So we've really had a strong pull from all propylene derivatives, which has helped. I think until the PDH outages or turnarounds are behind us, I think we're going to have tightness in propylene. The other thing is propane is very far out today, so - as economic feedstock. So maybe if propane cracking returns in the summer when propane gets cheaper, you could see a little bit more propylene supply. But my sense is that we have a pretty tight propylene market, probably through May.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas. Your line is open.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Bob I was just wondering if you could discuss business conditions in Olefins and Polyolefins in Europe and maybe compare them to what they were like in 2019? That is - what is it about the European market going into 2021 that seems to be so strong? And do you see that sustainably strong?\nBhavesh Patel: Sure. Great question. So as you've probably read Jeff that there has been higher incidence of COVID in Europe, lockdowns in various countries, but we've not seen significant impact on demand for Polyolefins. So Polyolefins demand has been has been still very resilient. If you look at EAI across the board and, of course, a lot of that Europe, if you think about our volume - if you compare Q1 '21, how our book is building compared to Q1 '19, we expect that ethylene is going to be up about 15% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21, polyethylene up 17%, polypropylene up 12%, Q1 '19 to Q1 '21. So it really points to very resilient demand. And as you look forward into the turnaround season, very heavy turnaround season also in Europe, in fact, in April, about 13% of the ethylene capacity is expected to be offline on a planned basis. So I mean, I think we could see tightness through a good bit of the first half of the year based on demand hanging in there even when there spike of COVID rates in various countries. And as the vaccine is distributed, I would think, all of that will settle down and the demand growth we should see year-over-year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer. Your line is open.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes, good morning guys. First question just around polyethylene capacity globally. So how much of effective new polyethylene capacity do you think ran in 2020 versus '19? And then does that number get bigger or smaller on your numbers as we go into 2020? And then the second one is, with Shell Pennsylvania plant, when that comes on, just because of its geographic advantage to some customers, do you think that will be more disruptive than an average plant that would start up in the Gulf Coast?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So Duffy, your first question, 2020 was a pretty heavy year for start-ups. So, including our new Hyperzone Polyethylene plant here in La Porte, I think '21, at least based on the schedules that we've seen that are publicly available, '21 should be lighter. And then in '22, we'll see more expansions come through. And that's what's reflected in that supply demand graph on Page 11 of our earnings materials on our slides. So I mean, I think, again, if you go back to what we talked about in the prepared materials, if we have recovery kind of growth in '21, at 7% or something, I think we essentially can absorb what's coming globally. Your question about the Shell plant that we'll start up in Pennsylvania, yes, I mean, certainly there will be temporary dislocation. They'll have to - they will find their way into the market, they'll export some product. But much like when, for example, Sasol started up, there was a quarter - there was a - for quarter, for a month or two, when these large plant start-up. But eventually as long as kind of the overall demand is such that the supply is needed, it tends to find its way to where the demand is. So I don't expect a massive disruption, but I would imagine we'll see some bumps when they do start up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed. Your line is open.\nHassan Ahmed: Bob question around two commodities, one on ethylene. As you take a look at the cost curve right now, who would you think is setting the ethylene price? And only reason I asked that is that obviously we've seen a major escalation in the price of Chinese coal? So that's one part. And the other question is around styrene. It seems Q4 volumes are very strong. What are you guys seeing in the near term as far as the styrene market goes as well?\nBhavesh Patel: Okay. So first of all, your question about the prices that are - you're right, the coal price has gone up quite a lot. So I would say CTO and MTO are probably setting the price. It's quite close. And given the high level of demand for ethylene derivatives, some MTO-based ethylene is still needed in China. So I would say those are the price setters. And your second question about styrene. We've already seen styrene come back off again. So we had really nice period in November or early December, but styrene has come back off. I think the way to think about styrene is when all the units are running, the margins will be pretty weak in styrene. Think when there are outages, we could see some improvement, but we're not expecting a lot in terms of contribution from styrene in 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from PJ Juvekar. Your line is open.\nPJ Juvekar: Bob, this strong pricing in polyethylene in December, January and February, three sort of unseasonal months, is that driven by global inventory build, if underlying demand is flat sequentially from 3Q to 4Q? And if it is - that inventory build, usually converters try to buy ahead of this price increases. So I guess my question is, are they trying to scramble to buy right now? And if they buy too much, do we end up with too much inventory in second half? Thank you.\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. Good question. I mean it is - the price strength has been somewhat unusual. But I think, the supply side, so we looked at carefully with the hurricanes that came through the U.S., there were some unplanned outages in Europe, there was just enough to really firm up the market. Speaking for ourselves, we can barely keep up with orders let alone allow any kind of pre-buy. So our team is essentially under pretty strict instructions to not allow pre-buy because we simply don't have the inventory to do it. We're just trying to meet the demand for customers. And many customers are saying, hey, if you're three days late, we're going to run out of product. So I think we find ourselves in a really tight environment. And I think if there is some softness, let's say in February, I can tell you for us, we're going to take the opportunity to selectively build back inventory and get ready for the spring season, which we expect to be robust like usual.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter. Your line is open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Bob, how are you thinking about Refining and Oxyfuels profitability as the world comes - gets back to normal? And '22, if it is a normal year, how do you think about the return to earnings of those two businesses?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, I mean, we're looking forward to and both are contributing again. It's been, as you know, a pretty challenging period. In Oxyfuels we had trouble moving the volume. It's just the margins and have been essentially zero. So part of what I think we - how you should think about LyondellBasell is that recovery and the related earnings are still in front of us. So as driving recovers, we don't even need air travel to recover back to the original or pre-COVID levels. If driving recovers with vaccinations and more domestic travel, we could really see both Refining and Oxyfuels contribute in the second half. And I think that's part of the earnings growth story as vaccinations become more common.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard. Your line is open.\nJonas Oxgaard: I was wondering about your feed slate, propane spike and the relative profitability seems to have flipped very rapidly. So question is what does that do to your Q1 margins? And how is your feed slate evolving here?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. It's good question. So we're really minimizing propane if cracking any at all. We have kind of what we call a barbell feed slate today, it's ethane and it's liquids. So gasoline, naphtha still look decent. And so we're either in ethane or with the other end of the spectrum. And both are profitable given where propylene is and butadiene - you know it's come off a little bit, but still hanging in there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Yefremov. Your line is open.\nAlex Yefremov: So I've noticed, typically U.S. exports about half of produced polyethylene. When global freight rates went up, it didn't seem to hurt U.S. polyethylene supply-demand dynamics, but only help that. Could you explain why?\nBhavesh Patel: So, first of all, I mean, I think you have to look at overall demand globally. And if the demand is such that the supply is needed, we find ways to get to meet the demand. Our - so you may be referring, a little bit to the container dislocations and so on. For us, we've not really been impacted by that much. We have long-term contracts. We've been able to continue our exports, primarily down to Latin America and Mexico, but also to Asia. So our exports have been uninterrupted and not really impacted by the spot freight rates or container rates. So we continue this business as usual for us.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch. Your line is open.\nFrank Mitsch: Bob, I wanted to come back to the polyethylene Slide 11, you mentioned that 2020 global demand growth was 4%. You guys sold 8% as I do the math between the U.S. and Europe. So could you talk about your operating rate? I mean, obviously, some of that is a Hyperzone capacity that was added. But I was wondering where you're operating rates were and if you could say that relative to the industry average in the sector? And as I'm looking at this chart, is this factoring in any delays whatsoever in terms of Chinese capacity? Or are you factoring in what the press releases have said there?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, so good morning Frank, or good afternoon. We - so, operating rates in the second half of the year for us in polyethylene were essentially unconstrained. We ran as much as we could. We had some unplanned downtime in Europe and the U.S., but we've essentially been running full since about July-August timeframe. And we expect to do that for the foreseeable future. And, yes, the volume growth was related to Hyperzone operating for part of the year. Your question about the supply side, on that chart on Page 11, we have not put any delays in for Chinese capacity. So it's essentially - we're assuming it's going to come on as advertised in IHS. It's really - that's to illustrate the impact of 7% growth versus 4% growth. How close we are to really having absorbing all of the capacity that's in front of us if we just have one year of more typical economic recovery type growth at 7%.\nOperator:  Our next question comes from John Roberts. Your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: You indicated that the balance sheet focus was going to be on debt reduction. Would it be helpful to your credit metrics if the Sasol option came earlier to you and you get full access to the cash flow there? Or would it be better if that comes later given you got to focus on getting your debt down right now?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, John, I mean, I think, clearly, our focus is to get the debt down now. I don't think that option is going to come sooner. So I think it's a very low probability. Given kind of the earnings profile, I think we could manage, but I don't think that's a plausible scenario. So our focus in terms of capital allocation is debt reduction, first and foremost the modest increases in the dividend and then perhaps buybacks, but those are pretty far away I think.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blair: Bob could you talk about your net long ethylene position in the U.S.? Are you able to capitalize on this recent spike up in spot ethylene? And then also, have you started to explore ethylene just given the startup of some new export facilities?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So, Matthew it's our Sasol acquisition. There has been - we've been fortunate with the timing because ethylene values have gone up, and we've increased our merchant position as a result of acquiring half of that facility. We are not exporting, but we have benefited from the increase in spot price. First and foremost, as you know, has a spot price moves that impacts the contract negotiations. So contract price has been moving up. Most of our formulas have spot contract plans. So we benefit that way. And some of - quite a bit of Sasol volume does have spot sales in it. So we've been able to capitalize on this improvement in ethylene margins that I think we'll probably be persistent through most of the first half of the year because of this very high unplanned turnaround schedule starting in March.\nOperator: And our last question comes from John McNulty. Your line is open.\nBhavesh Mahesh Lodaya: This is Mahesh Lodaya up for John. When we look at the volume recovery for polypropylene, we are back to a close to pre-pandemic levels. However, we are obviously still going to see demand recovery from some of the key autos, commercial construction in some of those end markets. So how much of the pre-pandemic base demand has now recovered? And then how much of new permanent ongoing demand was created by the pandemic itself? Thank you.\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. Great question. So I'm going to give you statistics for the first part of your question, and then I'll talk kind of qualitatively about the second half. So if you look at our polypropylene volumes, I'll tell you how Q1 '21, we think is shaping up compared to Q1 '19. In the U.S., we're likely up 14% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21, and in EAI, up 12%. Another sort of data point is that polypropylene demand in China grew about 10% from 2019 to '20. Now, your second question about pandemic-related, certainly the masks and the medical gowns and all of that, it's been pretty important driver. And frankly, I think even after vaccinations are more widespread, use of masks will still be pretty and I think for most of this year and maybe even into next year. So it's - I don't have a number for you on what percent of the growth was accounted for by the masks. But if I were to estimate, maybe 1% to 2% of the growth is related to masks of the 14% that I mentioned for the Americas polypropylene growth.\nBhavesh Patel: All right. So I think that was our last question. I'd like to just offer a few closing remarks before I let you all go. Thank you for hanging in there. So first of all, with the completion of 2020, you've seen the resilient performance from our company through the first significant downturn since our emergence back in 2010. Our fourth quarter results have given you a preview of our increased earnings power. Going into 2021, we have more assets, strong order books, tight markets and rising economic activity. All of which should provide confidence for continuing improvement into the first quarter. While much of our industry is scheduling high levels of second quarter maintenance, LyondellBasell's planned downtime for 2021 is relatively light. Our assets are ready to capture improving seasonal demand, Refining and Oxyfuels businesses are poised to benefit from increased mobility during the second half of the year. I think all of this positions us well to increase cash flow and continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we work our way through 2021. So thank you for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you in about 90 days. Have a great weekend.\nOperator: That concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bhavesh Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us to discuss our fourth quarter and full year results for 2020. Let's turn to Slide 3. 2020 was unlike anything we have ever seen or experienced, oil price volatility, a global pandemic and an associated recession. To call this year unprecedented would be an understatement. So before we get into the results today, I want to take a few minutes to provide some context around our approach to navigating the past year, because I think it speaks well to who we are as a company and the character and talent of our team. Early in the year, as it became clear that the virus is becoming more widespread, our leadership team established three guiding principles for the short term; number one, protect our employees and communities; two, keep our commitments to our investors; and three, take actions to strengthen the company for the future. In past earnings calls, I've talked about some attributes of our culture; operational and commercial excellence, cost management and capital discipline. These qualities served us particularly well during 2020 as we bolstered liquidity by rapidly accessing capital markets, minimizing working capital and efficiently generating cash. Importantly, we honored our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating and continue to fund dividends and capital investments with cash from operations. As we review our results today, I hope the outcome of these priorities and the benefits of this culture will be clear. Beyond the strategy itself, I also want to take a moment to acknowledge our global team that delivered our results. These individuals, both those who were able to work remotely and those who continue to work on the front lines at our manufacturing sites form a strong and nimble team. They have my sincere and deepest gratitude. If the pandemic reinforced anything, it is the value of our products and industry in serving modern society's needs. Knowing that the materials produced by our plants go into end products like face masks, medical gowns and COVID-19 test kits, our team took immediate action to ensure our manufacturing sites would continue to supply our customers, while prioritizing the safety of our workforce. I'm very proud to say that not only did we continue to operate reliably, but to date there have been no cases of workplace virus transmission among our employees. Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10, which illustrates our quarterly profitability over the past five quarters. Unlike a typical year where LyondellBasell's business portfolio would follow a seasonal trend with peak earnings occurring midyear, the pattern seen in 2020 are reversed with higher profitability in the first and fourth quarters. The rebound in profitability since the second quarter has been remarkable as the global economy proceeds on a path to recovery. EBITDA in the final quarter of 2020 was $1.3 billion, the highest for any fourth quarter since 2017, and more than $375 million higher than the prior quarter. The trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter. Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments served strong consumer-driven demand for packaging and non-durable products throughout the year, while our Intermediates and Derivatives and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments benefited from improving industrial sector demand for durable goods during the second half of the year. We have only seen modest recovery in the demand for transportation fuels. Our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses continued to experience headwinds from excess capacity and slack demand due to persistently low global mobility. While we would naturally prefer to see strength in all of the markets we serve, the geographic and end-market diversity of our product portfolio continues to provide offsets that help to dampen business cycles. Let's turn to Slide 11, and look at the latest thoughts from consultants on the global polyethylene business cycle. Industry consultants have forecasted that capacity additions, especially in China, could outpace global demand over the next four years. These predictions seem reminisce in the forecast from consulting reports published in 2016 depicted by the dotted blue line, which predicted global operating rates would get due to the capacity additions on the U.S. Gulf Coast from 2017 through 2018. The actual operating rate depicted by the solid line demonstrates that press releases announcing capacity additions often have ambitious timelines and typical delays in construction and commissioning can allow consistent demand growth to absorb capacity additions with less impact on operating rates and margins than predicted. In addition to delays in capacity additions, we believe recent forecast underestimate growth in demand. Early in the pandemic many predicted declines in PV demand for 2020. By the middle of the year, forecast improved to flat demand, most consultants now believe that global PV demand grew by approximately 4% in 2020, similar to growth rate seen consistently over the past 30 years. Adjusting these forecast to 4% demand growth for both 2020 and 2021 results in a predicted operating rate depicted in the dotted gray line. If 2021 follows pattern seen after prior recessions and demand growth rebounds to levels higher than 4%, then operating rates would accordingly move upward. Our rebounding economy that increases 2021 global polyethylene demand by 7% followed by a reversion to consultant forecast of 4% growth thereafter would generate the robust operating rate forecast depicted by the dotted orange line. In summary, we believe the next wave of capacity additions will result in operating rates within the boundaries of a balanced market. The next wave of capacity additions will undoubtedly occur, but we believe that typical project delays, a few project cancellations and perhaps increased demand from a recovering economy could contribute to a more orderly absorption of the new capacity by the global markets. Let's review the fourth quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston Refinery. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 12. Fourth quarter 2020 EBITDA was $722 million, $318 million higher than the third quarter. Margins improved on higher pricing driven by higher demand for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefins results increased $185 million compared to the third quarter of 2020. Margin improved on higher ethylene and propylene pricing. Volume increased with improved demand. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $65 million higher than the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. For the full year, results decreased by $514 million, margins declined for both Olefins and Polyolefins, driven by lower prices for Olefins co-products and polyethylene, despite lower feedstock costs. Lifestyle changes associated with the pandemic drove increases in demand for non-durable packaging and consumer goods providing strength in the polyethylene market and increased volumes for ethylene and polyethylene. Based on strong February orders, increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the fourth quarter, EBITDA was $251 million, an increase of $120 million compared to the third quarter. Improving demand for polyolefin and a full quarter of contribution from our Bora joint venture increased both polyolefin volumes and equity income. Olefins results were relatively unchanged with lower margins due to increased maintenance expense, partially offset by increased volume. Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million, driven by higher demand and volumes from our Bora joint venture. Equity income increased about $60 million with more than half of that improvement arising from Bora. Full year EBITDA was $236 million lower than 2019. Margins declined in both Olefins and Polyolefins due to lower polyolefin and ethylene prices outpacing lower feedstock costs. Polyolefin demand remained relatively stable with increased sales from the start-up of our Bora joint venture during the fourth quarter. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. Please turn to Slide 14. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $196 million, a decline of $49 million from the third quarter 2020. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products, driven by weaker gasoline demand and prices muted the margin improvement in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business. Fourth quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to significantly higher Asia propylene oxide pricing, driven by strong demand and tight markets supplies. Intermediate Chemicals results were relatively unchanged. Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased by approximately $10 million, a small volume improvements or more than offset by margin declines due to continued lower gasoline prices and higher butane feedstock costs. During 2020 EBITDA declined $714 million compared to 2019. Margin declined in most businesses, primarily in the Oxyfuels & Related Products and Intermediate Chemicals businesses. Volumes for most businesses also declined due to lower demand, partially offset by increased Asia demand for our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives products. In the first quarter of 2021, we expect margins to be relatively flat as market tightness in Asia is alleviated by higher industry supply. Our volumes will be impacted during the first quarter due to planned maintenance at our Channelview propylene oxide and styrene monomer unit. Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $126 million, a $9 million increase over the third quarter 2020. Volumes increased with improved demand in the automotive sector partially offset by lower margins. Results for both Compounding & Solutions and Advanced Polymer businesses were relatively unchanged. Within our Compounding & Solutions business volumes increased as automotive manufacturers ramped up production. Margins declined as a result of product prices lagging price increases for propylene feedstocks. Full year EBITDA for the segment was $381 million, a $51 million decline over 2019. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from an $80 million reduction in integration costs. Volumes decline would significantly lower automotive, appliance and construction demand, partially offset by higher margins as a result of product mix. We expect continued recovery in industrial durable goods demand, particularly for products from our Advanced Polymers business during the spring. At our Investor Day in 2019, we announced an increased target of $200 million of synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition. We have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we are beginning to capture an annual run rate of more than $200 million, which will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Now let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery in durable goods demand is playing out in the polypropylene and compounds markets for our company on Slide 16. China's rapid response to control COVID transmission and stimulate industrial production resulted in strong demand growth despite the pandemic. Automotive production in China was up 6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter last year, and China polypropylene demand for the full year 2020 increased by 10% over 2019. The strength in durable goods markets is also evident in LyondellBasell's metrics. Our polypropylene inventory levels hit all time lows in both North America and Europe on strong market demand. In North America, construction activities increased in the fourth quarter with a 5% year-over-year increase in demand for single-ply thermoplastic roofing materials that utilize our Catalloy advanced polymers. Looking at our own order books for polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy within the EPS segment a nice V-shaped recovery is shown in the chart where the forecast for January suggests the first quarter that is nearly the same level seen in the first quarter of 2019. Tight markets, low inventory and strong orders indicate that markets for polypropylene-based durable goods are showing strength going into the first quarter 2021. The increased demand for our polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics and Catalloy products should benefit the EPS segment in 2021. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was negative $74 million, a $47 million improvement versus the third quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and impairment of the Houston Refinery in the third quarter. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to lower fixed costs and improved margin capture Improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread were more than offset by increased costs for Renewable, Identification, Number of credits, or RINs. Similar to the prior period, we operate the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity to match with its demand with an average crude throughput of 214,000 barrels per day. Full-year EBITDA was negative $289 million, $224 million lower than 2019. Refining margins were compressed due to pandemic driven reductions in demand for gasoline and jet fuel. The Maya 2-1-1 spread was at a historically low point during the year and averaged $12.63 per barrel. 2020 crude throughput was limited to an average of 223,000 barrels per day as we actively managed operations to match the reduced market demand. Refining margins are expected to move sideways until demand for gasoline and jet fuel improves. We plan to continue operating the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. We remain diligent with efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at our Houston Refinery and we'll continue to evaluate production decisions as the market evolves. Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. EBITDA was $45 million during the fourth quarter and was $324 million for the full year. Fourth quarter Technology profitability declined due to a lower number of licensing revenue recognition milestones. Catalyst margins increased due to inventory mix improvements probably offset by decrease in volumes as customers managed year-end inventories. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones and improving catalyst demand, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability to improve to a similar level as in the first quarter of 2019. Please turn to Slide 19 for a refreshed view of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a clear and straightforward strategy to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation, while moderating our capital expenditure budget to $2 billion or less for each of the next three years. The formula is simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should improve free cash flow at any point in business cycles. Let me summarize the year's highlights and outlook with Slide 20. During 2020 LyondellBasell remained true to our strategy of capturing value and delivering resilient results at all points in the cycle. We delivered on our commitments to investors, served our customers and supported our employees, while moving forward on sustainability initiatives. By maximizing cash generation and prioritizing liquidity, we maintained our investment grade rating and extended the continuity of our dividend. Demand for consumer-driven goods remained strong and durable goods markets are rebounding with increased industrial activity. As global mobility improves, we expect that demand and margin for fuels from our Refinery and Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses will follow. Over the past several years LyondellBasell has captured opportunities through disciplined and profitable growth investments whether building, acquiring or partnering on assets. Our company focused on leveraging our technology, building on our advantages and increasing our earnings capacity. Our path is clear. LyondellBasell will remain focused on meeting our commitments and pursuing a disciplined financial strategy. With robust cash generation and ample liquidity, we plan to continue strengthening our balance sheet and optimizing our portfolio during 2021. We look forward to sharing our progress toward developing more circular business models for our industry and creating a more supportive culture for our workforce that will allow all of us to continue delivering sustainable results for years to come. In summary, our strategy has served us well and now LyondellBasell is poised to emerge from this pandemic with more earnings power and free cash flow potential. We are now pleased to take your questions. Yes, we can. Yes. Yes. Go ahead. There is a bit of background noise. Amanda, perhaps this is on your side. Go ahead Steve. Thank you, Steve. Good morning. First of all, in terms of how much of our polyethylene demand our customers are asking for sustainable products, I mean, if you think about our sales of polyethylene more than half of it goes in the packaging, whether it's flexible or blow molded bottles or those sorts of things. So I think it's safe to say more than half, probably close two thirds over time, we'll want to have sustainable products as part of the mix that we sell them. In terms of their preference, for food packaging, clearly, the molecular recycling would be the most desirable because essentially what we're doing is we're creating new feedstock and producing FDA approved resin. So our molecular recycling will be the most important development as we look at the next five to seven years, but I think mechanical recycling will continue to play a role. And that's where we're capturing the near-term opportunities. And as you know, we have a molecular recycling pilot plant that we built in Italy. We're working - I had a review with my R&D team, in fact, this week, and they are working diligently to perfect the technology and get to semi works as soon as possible. Yes, so good morning, Bob. Things are going very well. So I'll start with Bora. We have - we've stacked up in the marketing side, both sales and customer service. We have a full-fledged organization. Local leadership in China ramping up our marketing efforts to sell more directly rather than through trading activities. So we're selling 100% of the polymer output over there in Bora, and things are going quite well. I will tell you it's increased our visibility on the market and demand trends. And so all the things we thought would occur when we had a bigger presence. We're starting to see that. Sasol JV, we're operating the facility as part of the agreement. We have - the site manager is a LyondellBasell employee. He was a site manager of one of our sites here in Houston. The marketing of the products is just part of our usual marketing that we do on other polyethylene grades that we already producing. So my sense is that the integration has been very seamless. And both JVs are really now part of the system. Good morning, Arun. Both are very tight. So let me talk about polyethylene first. Speaking for ourselves and inventory is still very low. In fact, we're looking for opportunities to build back some inventory, but because demand is so strong, we're not able to do that. On the pricing front January price increase discussions are essentially finished and the implementation of the increase is going to occur. The next increase for February is on the table and likely there will be very good discussion about that as well. If you think about markets being tight in January, typically as we go into the spring, we see a seasonal uptick in demand. And so I think that supply-demand fundamentals are going to remain tight through the first half of the year for polyethylene. And polypropylene, similarly, as you said, propylene prices run up quite a lot. But inventories are still low, we're struggling to build inventory because demand is so good. And as you said about durables, probably applies more to polypropylene. As the economic recovery really takes hold in Europe and U.S., I think we're going to see probably more pool from durable goods end uses. So we're quite constructive of about both frankly. It looks tight through the first half of the year. And the other thing I would add is, there is quite a bit of downtime on - a planned downtime in the industry for crackers. So that's going to keep monomer prices probably high through the first half of the year. There is also a very large PDH turnaround here on the Gulf Coast. So that will keep propylene pretty strong through May, I would imagine. Sure, Vincent. So, first of all, what we were trying to illustrate with that chart is that it won't take much for the operating rates to just go flat from here, 3% additional demand in one year. Now, typically in recovery years, we've seen demand growth above trend line in the first year or even two post recessions. To your question about how do you bridge the 4 to the 7, first of all, in polyethylene, here in the U.S. the pipe market has been very, very weak. And if there is an infrastructure bill as oil and gas starts to come back a bit, I think that could help demand growth here in the U.S. and likely if there's infrastructure spending in Europe in China, I mean you could really see that market contribute to bringing the 4 to 7. The other is --there still enough durable goods content or industrial demand or for example like industrial bulk containers. As industrial activity picks up, I think, we'll see recovery or higher demand rates for polyethylene. So I don't think it would take much to get to the 7%. And when you factor that in, it looks like operating rates could stay elevated through over the next few years. Yes. So we are pleased with how the APS segment has really evolved. What I'm most pleased about is that the integration is essentially complete. And so now as we face into recovering markets, the increase in volume should increase earning will see those synergies go straight to the bottom line. And that's really ahead of us. So the best is in still in part of us for APS, hopefully the same for our brands. In terms of bolt-on acquisitions, yes, I mean, we're out - we now that the platform is essentially set. It would be very natural if we could find opportunities to bolt-on and add to the segments that are most attractive to us. So we're keeping a watchful eye for that and we'll keep you updated. But given the kind of acquisitions that are possible, the size will be very modest, and it will be more about just roll-ups. Yes, Kevin, it's kind of reminiscent of like 10 years ago when we used to see a lot more volatility, and generally when propylene gets close to being sold out any outage causes these kinds of burst in price. I would add a fourth item to your list, which is very robust demand for the derivatives of propylene, not just polypropylene, but the other propylene derivatives, cumene and derivatives and so on. So we've really had a strong pull from all propylene derivatives, which has helped. I think until the PDH outages or turnarounds are behind us, I think we're going to have tightness in propylene. The other thing is propane is very far out today, so - as economic feedstock. So maybe if propane cracking returns in the summer when propane gets cheaper, you could see a little bit more propylene supply. But my sense is that we have a pretty tight propylene market, probably through May. Sure. Great question. So as you've probably read Jeff that there has been higher incidence of COVID in Europe, lockdowns in various countries, but we've not seen significant impact on demand for Polyolefins. So Polyolefins demand has been has been still very resilient. If you look at EAI across the board and, of course, a lot of that Europe, if you think about our volume - if you compare Q1 '21, how our book is building compared to Q1 '19, we expect that ethylene is going to be up about 15% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21, polyethylene up 17%, polypropylene up 12%, Q1 '19 to Q1 '21. So it really points to very resilient demand. And as you look forward into the turnaround season, very heavy turnaround season also in Europe, in fact, in April, about 13% of the ethylene capacity is expected to be offline on a planned basis. So I mean, I think we could see tightness through a good bit of the first half of the year based on demand hanging in there even when there spike of COVID rates in various countries. And as the vaccine is distributed, I would think, all of that will settle down and the demand growth we should see year-over-year. Yes. So Duffy, your first question, 2020 was a pretty heavy year for start-ups. So, including our new Hyperzone Polyethylene plant here in La Porte, I think '21, at least based on the schedules that we've seen that are publicly available, '21 should be lighter. And then in '22, we'll see more expansions come through. And that's what's reflected in that supply demand graph on Page 11 of our earnings materials on our slides. So I mean, I think, again, if you go back to what we talked about in the prepared materials, if we have recovery kind of growth in '21, at 7% or something, I think we essentially can absorb what's coming globally. Your question about the Shell plant that we'll start up in Pennsylvania, yes, I mean, certainly there will be temporary dislocation. They'll have to - they will find their way into the market, they'll export some product. But much like when, for example, Sasol started up, there was a quarter - there was a - for quarter, for a month or two, when these large plant start-up. But eventually as long as kind of the overall demand is such that the supply is needed, it tends to find its way to where the demand is. So I don't expect a massive disruption, but I would imagine we'll see some bumps when they do start up. Okay. So first of all, your question about the prices that are - you're right, the coal price has gone up quite a lot. So I would say CTO and MTO are probably setting the price. It's quite close. And given the high level of demand for ethylene derivatives, some MTO-based ethylene is still needed in China. So I would say those are the price setters. And your second question about styrene. We've already seen styrene come back off again. So we had really nice period in November or early December, but styrene has come back off. I think the way to think about styrene is when all the units are running, the margins will be pretty weak in styrene. Think when there are outages, we could see some improvement, but we're not expecting a lot in terms of contribution from styrene in 2021. Yes. Good question. I mean it is - the price strength has been somewhat unusual. But I think, the supply side, so we looked at carefully with the hurricanes that came through the U.S., there were some unplanned outages in Europe, there was just enough to really firm up the market. Speaking for ourselves, we can barely keep up with orders let alone allow any kind of pre-buy. So our team is essentially under pretty strict instructions to not allow pre-buy because we simply don't have the inventory to do it. We're just trying to meet the demand for customers. And many customers are saying, hey, if you're three days late, we're going to run out of product. So I think we find ourselves in a really tight environment. And I think if there is some softness, let's say in February, I can tell you for us, we're going to take the opportunity to selectively build back inventory and get ready for the spring season, which we expect to be robust like usual. Yes, I mean, we're looking forward to and both are contributing again. It's been, as you know, a pretty challenging period. In Oxyfuels we had trouble moving the volume. It's just the margins and have been essentially zero. So part of what I think we - how you should think about LyondellBasell is that recovery and the related earnings are still in front of us. So as driving recovers, we don't even need air travel to recover back to the original or pre-COVID levels. If driving recovers with vaccinations and more domestic travel, we could really see both Refining and Oxyfuels contribute in the second half. And I think that's part of the earnings growth story as vaccinations become more common. Yes. It's good question. So we're really minimizing propane if cracking any at all. We have kind of what we call a barbell feed slate today, it's ethane and it's liquids. So gasoline, naphtha still look decent. And so we're either in ethane or with the other end of the spectrum. And both are profitable given where propylene is and butadiene - you know it's come off a little bit, but still hanging in there. So, first of all, I mean, I think you have to look at overall demand globally. And if the demand is such that the supply is needed, we find ways to get to meet the demand. Our - so you may be referring, a little bit to the container dislocations and so on. For us, we've not really been impacted by that much. We have long-term contracts. We've been able to continue our exports, primarily down to Latin America and Mexico, but also to Asia. So our exports have been uninterrupted and not really impacted by the spot freight rates or container rates. So we continue this business as usual for us. Yes, so good morning Frank, or good afternoon. We - so, operating rates in the second half of the year for us in polyethylene were essentially unconstrained. We ran as much as we could. We had some unplanned downtime in Europe and the U.S., but we've essentially been running full since about July-August timeframe. And we expect to do that for the foreseeable future. And, yes, the volume growth was related to Hyperzone operating for part of the year. Your question about the supply side, on that chart on Page 11, we have not put any delays in for Chinese capacity. So it's essentially - we're assuming it's going to come on as advertised in IHS. It's really - that's to illustrate the impact of 7% growth versus 4% growth. How close we are to really having absorbing all of the capacity that's in front of us if we just have one year of more typical economic recovery type growth at 7%. Yes, John, I mean, I think, clearly, our focus is to get the debt down now. I don't think that option is going to come sooner. So I think it's a very low probability. Given kind of the earnings profile, I think we could manage, but I don't think that's a plausible scenario. So our focus in terms of capital allocation is debt reduction, first and foremost the modest increases in the dividend and then perhaps buybacks, but those are pretty far away I think. Yes. So, Matthew it's our Sasol acquisition. There has been - we've been fortunate with the timing because ethylene values have gone up, and we've increased our merchant position as a result of acquiring half of that facility. We are not exporting, but we have benefited from the increase in spot price. First and foremost, as you know, has a spot price moves that impacts the contract negotiations. So contract price has been moving up. Most of our formulas have spot contract plans. So we benefit that way. And some of - quite a bit of Sasol volume does have spot sales in it. So we've been able to capitalize on this improvement in ethylene margins that I think we'll probably be persistent through most of the first half of the year because of this very high unplanned turnaround schedule starting in March. Yes. Great question. So I'm going to give you statistics for the first part of your question, and then I'll talk kind of qualitatively about the second half. So if you look at our polypropylene volumes, I'll tell you how Q1 '21, we think is shaping up compared to Q1 '19. In the U.S., we're likely up 14% from Q1 '19 to Q1 '21, and in EAI, up 12%. Another sort of data point is that polypropylene demand in China grew about 10% from 2019 to '20. Now, your second question about pandemic-related, certainly the masks and the medical gowns and all of that, it's been pretty important driver. And frankly, I think even after vaccinations are more widespread, use of masks will still be pretty and I think for most of this year and maybe even into next year. So it's - I don't have a number for you on what percent of the growth was accounted for by the masks. But if I were to estimate, maybe 1% to 2% of the growth is related to masks of the 14% that I mentioned for the Americas polypropylene growth. All right. So I think that was our last question. I'd like to just offer a few closing remarks before I let you all go. Thank you for hanging in there. So first of all, with the completion of 2020, you've seen the resilient performance from our company through the first significant downturn since our emergence back in 2010. Our fourth quarter results have given you a preview of our increased earnings power. Going into 2021, we have more assets, strong order books, tight markets and rising economic activity. All of which should provide confidence for continuing improvement into the first quarter. While much of our industry is scheduling high levels of second quarter maintenance, LyondellBasell's planned downtime for 2021 is relatively light. Our assets are ready to capture improving seasonal demand, Refining and Oxyfuels businesses are poised to benefit from increased mobility during the second half of the year. I think all of this positions us well to increase cash flow and continue to strengthen our balance sheet as we work our way through 2021. So thank you for your interest in our company and we look forward to updating you in about 90 days. Have a great weekend."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7, and let me begin by highlighting our track record of improving cash conversion. The benefit of efficient cash conversion becomes more apparent during periods of economic downturns when liquidity provides defense against risk from volatility and uncertainty. Over the past year LyondellBasell converted 88% of our EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. As a result of the challenging market dynamics in 2020, our business teams took aggressive actions in managing inventories to drive free cash flow and maximize liquidity to release more than $300 million of cash from working capital. We are pleased to report that despite the downturn, we've fully funded $1.4 billion in dividends and our $1.9 billion capital investment program through cash generated from operating activities in 2020. The $4.20 per share of dividends paid by our company during the year extends LyondellBasell's track record of consistently paying and increasing our base dividend over the past 10 years. Let's continue to Slide 8 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment throughout the year. As you can see, we increased the amount of cash in our balance sheet by approximately $1.4 billion during 2020, to end the year with $2.5 billion in cash and liquid investments. Cash from operations fully funded a small amount of share repurchases in the first quarter of 2020 as well as the full year's dividends and capital expenditures. In 2020, we accessed very attractive debt capital markets to extend maturities of existing debt, fund acquisitions and bolster liquidity. These borrowings increased gross debt by $3.9 billion relative to the prior year. A portion of the new bonds funded the $470 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China, and the $2 billion acquisition of our 50% share of the Louisiana integrated polyethylene joint venture with Sasol. We incurred about $70 million in pre-tax cost due to our fourth quarter refinancing activities. We ended the year with $5.2 billion of cash and available liquidity that enabled us to reduce the balance of our term loan by $500 million in January of 2021. We will continue to prioritize deleveraging over the course of this year, which should allow us to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\n I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. \nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator. Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Third Quarter 2020 Teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer.\n Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com.\n Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website.\n Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until November 30 by calling (888) 566-0568 in the United States and 203-369-3064 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 6541.\n During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives.\n Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the recent volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. During the third quarter, we recognized pretax LCM benefits totaling $160 million compared to LCM charges of $323 million during the first half of 2020. During the third quarter, we also recognized a noncash impairment of $582 million that reflects our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments.\n With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. \nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We hope that you, your colleagues and your families are all staying healthy and safe during these challenging times. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results.\n Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses benefited from improving volumes during the initial months of a recovering global economy. After excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory benefits and an impairment of our refinery, third quarter EBITDA was approximately $900 million, an improvement of more than $200 million relative to the second quarter. We continued to focus on cash generation and retention by efficiently converting more than 90% of our EBITDA into cash from operating activities and by carefully managing our working capital to end the quarter with approximately $5.5 billion of cash and available liquidity.\n Our strong balance sheet has served us well by allowing the company to capture opportunity during this downturn through the establishment and start-up of a new integrated polyolefin joint venture in China, followed by the announcement in October of our intent to form another integrated polyethylene joint venture in Louisiana before the end of this year. Both of these joint ventures offer unique opportunities for LyondellBasell to grow one of the core areas of our business by investing in new, already operating, high-quality assets that have significant upside as market conditions continue to improve. These transactions are prime examples of our strategy to identify, develop and capture opportunities through business cycles.\n Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. Our employees and contractors maintain their focus on performing work safely to eliminate injuries, prevent virus spread and minimize emissions from our assets. During September, we had one recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. Although our goal is always 0 injuries, the September year-to-date recordable injury rate across both our employees and contractors is on track to improve upon the top decile industry performance we achieved in 2019.\n Our protocols for workplace sanitization, facial covering, social distancing, health screening and contact tracing have been successful in minimizing the spread of coronavirus across our global facilities. We have no evidence of work-related COVID infections across our global workforce. Our major manufacturing locations operated continuously throughout the pandemic as an essential industry. Our office workers have returned to work in Asia, and we are gradually increasing our office populations across the rest of the world in accordance with local regulations and safety metrics, driven by both employee and community infection rates. We are using a safe and responsible approach to gradually increase the number of personnel at our Houston headquarters during the fourth quarter.\n In September, our company released our annual sustainability report, the cover of which is shown on Slide 5. We hope that you will all take some time to review the report. You will note that the cover image of our report does not depict images of solar arrays, wind mills or a pristine beach. Our products make modern life possible and often have a favorable environmental footprint relative to the alternatives. We recognize that plastic waste represents a substantial challenge for society, and our goal is to play a central role in developing pragmatic solutions that balance the needs for environmental, economic and social sustainability.\n Our sustainability report describes the actions we will take as a company to help tackle 3 global challenges: eliminating plastic waste, addressing climate change and supporting a thriving society. Over the next decade, we will continue to develop successful waste management projects through the Alliance to End Plastic Waste that will recover and reuse millions of tons of plastic waste. By 2030, we aim to produce 2 million tons of recycled and renewable polymers across our asset base. We are targeting a CO2 intensity that will be 15% lower by 2030 than it was in 2015. And the events of this year have led us to redouble our efforts to ensure a culture of inclusion across our diverse global workforce. We hope you will find that this year's report not only tracks our progress on meaningful metrics for investors, but also describes the increasing scope of our company's ambitions and strategies to support the transition to a low-carbon circular economy and drive solutions for a more sustainable and thriving society.\n Let's turn to Slide 6 and briefly review how we are advancing on our growth strategy with the Sasol joint venture that we announced on October 2. In summary, LyondellBasell has agreed to purchase a 50% interest in a newly built ethylene cracker, 2 polyethylene units and the associated utilities and infrastructure located in Lake Charles, Louisiana for $2 billion. LyondellBasell will operate the assets and market all of the polyethylene produced by this joint venture. As we discussed a few weeks ago, this transaction will enable both partners to maximize the value of these world-class assets while advancing our respective strategic objectives. While no formal process is set out in the agreements, LyondellBasell will have the potential to acquire the JV assets in full at some point in the future.\n In addition to the Louisiana joint venture, we also established and started up a joint venture with Bora in China just a few weeks ago. We have been very clear that we have no intention of building a new integrated ethylene cracker on our own for the foreseeable future. But when these 2 JVs in China and Louisiana are taken together, we are essentially acquiring the full capacity and immediate financial benefits of a new and operational world-scale integrated cracker complex with minimal exposure to the risk from project execution, timing uncertainty and opportunity costs that are typically incurred during the multiyear construction of these types of facilities. Plus, we are acquiring this world-scale integrated cracker at a very attractive valuation. With respect to our joint venture with Sasol, both partners are working diligently and making good progress towards obtaining the required approvals that should allow us to close the transaction before the end of this calendar year.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial results over the past quarter. \nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.\n Please turn to Slide 7. While the recession and subsequent recovery has presented challenges for our business, we have also found great opportunities in the debt capital markets to reduce our interest costs and extend maturities by refinancing some of our debt as we raise capital to support the formation of the Louisiana joint venture. Immediately after announcing our agreement with Sasol, we renegotiated covenants, extended our revolving credit facility by 1 year and issued $3.9 billion in new bonds. These bonds were very well received by the market with an order book that was more than 5x oversubscribed. We locked in favorable rates with a weighted average coupon of 2.72% across 6 tranches with maturities ranging from 3 to 40 years. The new bonds serve to reduce the weighted average interest rate across our debt portfolio by 34 basis points. After redemptions planned for the coming days, we will have both accessible near-term maturities as well as staggered long-term maturities without any large maturity towers.\n With the completion of the Sasol joint venture, we will prioritize deleveraging over share repurchases and work toward improving debt ratios to levels consistent with a stronger investment-grade credit rating. We expect to continue to fund our dividend primarily from operating cash flows. One more modeling item, in the fourth quarter, we'll have a charge of approximately $80 million for loss on extinguishment of debt associated with our refinancing activities.\n As Bob mentioned, our cash conversion remained strong in the third quarter. On Slide 8, you can see that over the last 12 months, more than 100% of our EBITDA was converted into nearly $4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our business teams remain highly focused on aggressively managing inventories through these dynamic markets while prioritizing cash generation and liquidity.\n Now please turn to Slide 9, where we provide further details on cash generation during the third quarter. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $2.8 billion. Capital expenditures of $425 million declined more than 25% relative to the second quarter, largely due to the reduced pace of construction on our new PO/TBA facility in Houston.\n In March, we announced that we were reducing activity on the PO/TBA project to both prevent virus spread at the construction site and conserve capital as we prepared for an uncertain economic environment from the pandemic. We have recently begun to reactivate the project and expect to return to a full pace over the coming weeks. We now expect the project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately 1 year later than our original schedule. The delayed timing of the start-up should provide benefits from a more fully recovered global economy as well as another year of global demand growth for the products. Higher costs arising from the delayed project execution, more extensive civil construction and unexpected tariffs on materials are expected to add at least 30% to our original cost estimate of $2.4 billion. We plan to provide a more definitive update on the estimated cost after activity is fully restored on the project early next year.\n In the third quarter, we also funded the $472 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China and paid $352 million in dividends to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash and available liquidity.\n The recognition of the impairment of our refinery during the third quarter has substantially changed the math for computing our 2020 forecasted tax rate. We now believe that our effective tax rate will be significantly lower than our prior guidance of a less than mid-teens percentage rate. Due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of the CARES Act and the timing of certain discrete events, we will not be providing more specific guidance at this time. On the other hand, the refinery impairment has resulted in our cash tax rate being higher than previously communicated. While it's difficult to forecast a specific percentage, we expect that our cash tax payments, net of refunds for 2020, will be approximately $200 million.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. \nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our third quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the noncash LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery.\n Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continued to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the third quarter was nearly $900 million, more than $200 million higher than the prior quarter. The upward trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter. Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments continue to serve strong consumer demand for products used in packaging and health care markets, while demand increased for intermediates and polymers used in durable goods applications. Volumes rebounded for compounded polymers from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment as automotive manufacturing reopened. Our Refining segment and the Oxyfuels & Related Products business continued to be challenged by decreased mobility that has reduced demand for transportation fuels. We expect that our diverse portfolio of businesses will see further improvement over the coming quarters as global economies continue on the path to recovery.\n Let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery is playing out in 2 significant markets for our company: polyethylene and transportation fuels. Let's turn to Slide 11 and review the growth in polyethylene demand during the pandemic. In a typical year, global polyethylene growth rate is approximately 4%. As you can see from the chart, in spite of the pandemic and recession, global polyethylene demand has still grown by 1% over the first 9 months of this year. As expected, Europe has seen a decline, but polyethylene demand in the U.S. and Canada and Northeast Asia regions has grown. Despite capacity additions, China demand will continue to far exceed its domestic production and incentivize North American exports. Low industry operating rates during the second quarter, along with Hurricane Laura in August and strong demand, tightened supply on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which led to polyethylene contract price increases totaling $420 per ton over the months of June through September. The recovery in demand for transportation fuels continues to be stubbornly slow.\n On Slide 12, you can see that while U.S. passenger and commercial vehicle travel has returned to within 10% of 2019 levels, U.S. flights and associated jet fuel consumption is still down by 40%. In March and April, refiners reduced operating rates in response to low demand and shifted distillate production from jet fuel to diesel. While gasoline and jet fuel inventories are currently at manageable levels, the excess distillate capacity has driven diesel inventories to levels 30% above the same period last year. Industry consultants believe that up to 3 million barrels of global refining capacity will need to be rationalized over the coming years to support more normalized margins since it is unlikely for airline travel to rebound to full utilization of the available refining capacity. As a result of an extended challenging outlook for refined product demand and margins, we recognized an impairment of the value of our refinery during the third quarter.\n Now let me summarize how these trends have come together for our company on Slide 13. In these initial months of economic recovery following the pandemic lockdowns, demand for our products has proven to be resilient. As you can see in the comparison to the third quarter of last year in the top chart, our sales volumes are largely intact. Further progress is needed to drive margin recovery.\n Comparing our performance relative to the second quarter in the bottom chart, you see the stepwise improvement. Volumes are up and margins have improved in all of our businesses, except for those serving transportation fuels markets. With continuing recovery in gasoline demand from passenger cars, we expect that our Oxyfuels business should recover more quickly than the broader refining market.\n Let's review the third quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment on Slide 14.\n Third quarter EBITDA was $404 million, $194 million higher than the second quarter. Improved demand for polyethylene and higher ethylene prices resulted in higher margins and volumes. Olefins results increased approximately $220 million compared to the second quarter. Industry ethylene supply tightened, which led to price increase that improved olefins margins. Volume increased due to higher demand and the completion of planned maintenance at our Channelview cracker in the second quarter. Polyolefin results increased by about $25 million during the third quarter. Increased polyethylene demand drove higher margin and volume, partially offset by a decrease in polypropylene margin. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P-Americas segment during the fourth quarter. Recent polyolefins price increases are expected to find support from industry supply constraints and robust demand. If global economies continue to improve, this momentum could persist for the remainder of the year.\n Now please turn to Slide 15 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $131 million, $88 million lower than the second quarter. Integrated profit margins were impacted by rising feedstock costs. Olefins results decreased approximately $30 million, driven by a decrease in margin. Ethylene margin decreased as higher feedstock costs outpaced an increase in ethylene prices. Combined polyolefins results decreased $20 million compared to the prior quarter. Polyethylene volume decreased due to summer demand and polypropylene margin declined on lower spreads. Although equity income decreased by approximately $10 million during the quarter, we were pleased to record a positive contribution for our Bora joint venture in September, the very first month of its operations. In October, we've seen a slight decline in integrated polyethylene margin. Over the fourth quarter, we expect a typical seasonal decline in demand as we approach the year-end holiday season.\n Please turn to Slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $245 million, $124 million higher than the prior quarter. Volumes rebounded with increased demand from durable goods markets in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business and the completion of planned maintenance in the Intermediate Chemicals business. Third quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased by approximately $45 million, driven by higher volumes from increased demand for polyurethanes in automotive, construction and furniture markets. Intermediate Chemicals results increased about $40 million, mostly driven by higher volumes after the completion of our planned maintenance. Oxyfuels & Related Products results increased approximately $10 million as a result of slightly higher margins due to higher product prices. In the coming quarter, stable demand for durable goods should continue to support profitability across most of the businesses in this segment. In October, oxyfuels prices and margins have come under additional pressure with lower seasonal driving demand.\n Now let's move on and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 17. Third quarter EBITDA was $117 million, $94 million higher than the second quarter. Volumes rebounded significantly, driven by higher demand for our products. Third quarter integration costs were $7 million. Compounding & Solutions results increased approximately $90 million due to higher volumes driven by increased demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end markets. Advanced Polymer's results were relatively unchanged. Although the demand for our products is improving, we expect typical seasonality to affect fourth quarter profitability for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment as activities in the automotive and construction market slowdown at the end of each calendar year.\n At our Investor Day last September, we updated our targets for synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition to $200 million. I'm happy to say that we have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we believe that the annual run rate of more than $200 million will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in this segment.\n Now let's turn to Slide 18 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was negative $121 million, a $107 million decrease versus the second quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and the onetime impairment of the Houston refinery. Results for the quarter were pressured by excess industry capacity and reduced demand for transportation fuels.\n In the third quarter, lower demand for gasoline and jet fuel negatively impacted both margins and volumes. Margins declined in the third quarter due to the absence of a hedging gain recorded in the second quarter, unfavorable byproduct spreads and a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread. During the quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread decreased to as low as $7.75 per barrel and ended at a historically low quarterly average of $9.89 per barrel. In response to sluggish demand, we reduced the utilization rate at the refinery to 81%, with an average crude throughput of 216,000 barrels per day. Refining margins are expected to remain compressed until demand for gasoline and jet fuel returns closer to pre-COVID levels. We plan to operate the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the fourth quarter.\n Let me be clear that we are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at the refinery. We are deferring nonsafety-related discretionary activities and reducing the salaried workforce by approximately 10% at our refinery through early retirements and potential worker redeployments to our other facilities in the Houston area. We are evaluating every possible option with regard to procuring crude oil and optimizing production from this asset.\n Please turn to Slide 19 as we review the results of our Technology segment. Third quarter Technology segment EBITDA was comparable to the prior quarter at $111 million. Licensing revenues increased, while catalyst margin and volume decreased. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that the fourth quarter Technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter of this year.\n Please turn to Slide 20 and allow me to review the progress of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a very clear and simple strategy: to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation while moderating our capital expenditures. Earlier this year, we accelerated our plans to reduce capital expenditures to $2 billion or less. We intend to maintain our capital budget at these levels for the next 3 years.\n In the second quarter, we started a 500,000-ton per year polyethylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone HDPE technology. At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this asset is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA.\n On September 1, we established a new joint venture in Northeastern China with Bora. This investment has already contributed earnings in September, and recent margins indicate the joint venture is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our company.\n In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and we formed the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. With integration completed, we are on track to capture $200 million in estimated synergies that should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the markets served by this segment.\n We expect to close the transaction for the Louisiana joint venture with Sasol before the end of this year. At full capacity and historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA to our company.\n In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, the combination of 2 new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023 could together add almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. The formula is very simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should result in higher free cash flow at any point in the business cycle.\n Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook with Slide 21. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged global positions enabled us to capture value and deliver resilient results. We demonstrated commercial agility by matching production with continued demand from packaging and health care markets and increasing volumes from automotive and other durable goods markets. We are seeing higher demand for our products from recovering global economies. Our North America polyethylene exports are increasing to support growing demand in Asia. Markets for discretionary durable goods are improving.\n As global mobility increases, the demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually show improvement. Our financial strategy continues to support our commitment to an investment-grade rating. With sound cash generation and disciplined capital deployment decisions, we are focused on maintaining the continuity of our dividend and prioritizing deleveraging upon completion of the Sasol transaction. Our goal at LyondellBasell is to capture opportunities throughout all points of business cycles. Over the past several years, we have carefully planted the seeds for profit-generating growth by building, acquiring and partnering on assets that expand our reach with new capabilities to sustainably harvest profitability from advantaged feedstocks, expanded product ranges and an increased footprint in the world's fastest-growing markets. We look forward to discussing our progress on maximizing cash flow from these investments over the coming quarters.\n We are now pleased to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] First question in the queue is from John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. \nJohn McNulty: So it looks like there's -- normally, you have a seasonal dip as you go from kind of 3Q levels to 4Q for a whole host of reasons. But it seems like given this year is a little bit of an atypical year, we'll call it, where you've got polyethylene prices surging throughout the third quarter and into the fourth and you've got maybe not quite as big of a delta around transportation fuels and that type of thing, I guess, how should we be thinking about your ability to maybe buck the trend of the normal seasonal dip going into 4Q? Is that something that's possible as the economies are recovering or is that maybe too much of a stretch? \nBhavesh Patel: John, indeed, especially in polyethylene, as you noted, this year -- and polypropylene, to an extent, this year, because of the hurricanes, and prior to that, the inventory reduction that we undertook as a company and generally as an industry, likely if there's some slowdown in demand, certainly, we, as a company, will take the opportunity to rebuild some inventory. We're at very, very low levels today and really kind of hand to mouth on many products. And I suspect that, that will get us through the seasonally soft period and get into next year. So I suspect that will be the case in polyolefins for the most part. \nOperator: Next question is from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. \nSteve Byrne: Just curious about this Bora JV. Is the $150 million EBITDA projection, is that effectively a net income number, kind of how would you compare that to your other assets in terms of the margin? And the reason I ask is, naphtha pricing has been pretty volatile over there, and I don't know whether that's fair to be looking at for that joint venture. Is it more likely that you're really getting the naphtha linked to oil prices from your refinery JV partner? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So Steve, the $150 million will be at the EBITDA level. So it's like equity earnings. Think of it that way. We do not expect dividends from Bora for a couple of years because the priority will be to delever. You will recall that the financing was roughly 1/3 equity, 2/3 debt for Bora. So the way we've outlined the joint venture and how the bank covenants work, we need to prioritize delevering first. We'll get some incremental commission income from the sales of polyolefins. The likely dividend income will come in year 3, 4 and onwards. \nOperator: Next question is from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. \nJeffrey Zekauskas: Brent prices have moved down from about, I don't know, $44 a barrel to $37 over the past month. Do you think that will make a difference to global petrochemical prices? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes, Jeff. So it may, but I think right now what's driving global petrochemical prices and especially polyolefin prices, it's more about the heightened level of demand that we've seen, very low levels of inventory. And I think that's really what's going to drive near-term pricing and provide support potentially for the final increase that's been announced here in the U.S.\n The other thing to note about a falling oil price is that it should benefit our European business. Because typically when oil price declines, we see margins open up in Europe. We saw the opposite of that in Q3 as oil prices actually increased, and we saw a bit of margin squeeze as we couldn't pass all of that through to the end users. So I think net, probably a benefit for Europe and near-term supply/demand likely drives pricing more so than Brent price. \nOperator: Next question is from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. \nAleksey Yefremov: Your O&P-Europe EBITDA has been sort of all over the place over the last 4 quarters with crude oil moving around, just like you just said, Bob. What's a good normalized number for the current environment for this segment? Is this closer to $130 million, $140 million that you just printed in the third quarter or maybe around $220 million EBITDA that you had in the first half of this year? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. Aleksey, right now because there's so many moving parts, I hesitate to give you a normalized number. I think you've put your finger on a few of the drivers, which is the direction of oil price. Also, Europe has been one of the softer regions in the world. We've seen improvement in Europe from Q2 to Q3, but it has not been to the degree that we've seen in China and the U.S. So I would say more of a mixed market in Europe and more clear strength in the U.S. and in China. Well, let's wait until next quarter and we'll try to help you with that normalized number, but today I hesitate just given all the moving parts. \nOperator: Next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. \nDuffy Fischer: Question about 2 of your assets. So first one is just the refinery. With the write-down, what is the current book value of that asset? And are we in the ZIP code where we're actually thinking about maybe shuttering the asset? And then the second one is just PO/TBA, the increase in costs there and the delay. What's that going to do to the return on that project? \nBhavesh Patel: Duffy, on the refinery, book value will be a little over $500 million, and we'll post that in our Q later today or Monday. So that's after the write-down. On the PO/TBA project, certainly, returns will be lower, we think, probably in the 10% range on returns for PO/TBA. I think in the end, we're going to net out kind of the delay of the project in this way. I think, first of all, it gave us some cushion on cash flow this year that given the uncertainty at the time we made the decision back in Q2, I still continue to believe it was the right thing to do. Secondly, when we do start up, it will be timed better when markets are recovering or fully recovered, hopefully by then. And we'll be bringing new capacity online at a time where it's more likely to be needed. So in the end, I think balancing near-term needs with long-term market demand, I think this was the right call to make, and we continue to believe it was the right call. \nOperator: Next question is from P.J. Juvekar with Citigroup. \nP.J. Juvekar: Polyethylene goes in disposables like plastic bags and packaging. So the European PE demand, down 3% versus North America up 4%, that was quite a stark difference between the 2. And I thought Europeans stuck at home would be doing the similar things like ordering from home and packaging demand goes up with that. Is there something underlying in Europe that's going on besides just the weak economy? \nBhavesh Patel: So from our perspective, we really saw the industrial part of the demand be very weak. And you will recall that the automotive sector was essentially shut down. For example, we produce polyethylene that goes into fuel tanks. And so that's continued to be weak. The automotive sector has not come back in Europe as strongly as it has in the U.S., industrial bulk containers, things like that. So the industrial part of demand was softer in Europe.\n I think on the packaging side, we saw similar strength of what we've seen in the U.S. So it's more about the level of activity. It didn't resume to the rate that we had expected. And lastly, in Q3, we still saw some seasonal slowdown from a typical European holiday season. There's the European kind of vacation season where some of the factories shut down. There was still some of that and enough that it caused some seasonality in Q3. \nOperator: Next question is from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. \nRobert Koort: Bob, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on ethane. I was looking at the nat gas markets are up 80% or 90% from the summer and the ethane markets look like they're only up about $0.10. The strip on ethane looks fairly subdued. But I guess if the oil markets are terrible, maybe there's less drilling and there's some more -- the downtime curtailments start to dissipate. Do you see a potential run on ethane in the first quarter? And is there something you guys can do proactively to insulate yourself if that were to happen? \nBhavesh Patel: Bob, so first of all, we estimate that ethane rejection rates are still pretty high, probably north of 500,000 barrels per day. I've heard numbers much higher, almost double that. But likely, the rejection is probably happening in regions that are further away from the Gulf Coast. So there's probably some in the Permian, but probably more as you get out towards the Rockies and certainly in the Marcellus. So today, you see ethane in the low 20s. I wouldn't be surprised to see ethane move to the mid-20s, especially here in the winter as natural gas prices rise a little bit more. I don't think we'll see a spike only because higher prices will likely incent more supply to come online. And maybe, as you say, with more crackers starting up, we may, on the margin, need more supply from further away regions. And if that were to happen, then maybe ethane does move to the mid-20s. But I still think there's so much rejection out there that a little bit of price will incent more supply. \nOperator: Next question is from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. \nDavid Begleiter: Bob, just on polyethylene for the October increase. One of the leading consultancies have declared that increase not successful. Do you agree with that assessment? \nBhavesh Patel: Well, so David, first of all, there are kind of timing effects on when these price increases get implemented, and it's phased over a 2-month period depending on contracts and size of buyer and that sort of thing. But if you kind of step back and look at the market environment today, as I mentioned earlier, inventories are still really low. And in fact, this morning, I was just looking at ACC data and days on hand is like 10% lower than where it was last year. And that's days on hand, so including a lower sales rate, the absolute inventory levels are incredibly low today. So I think that points to a tighter market.\n Secondly, we don't see demand really letting up yet. Our order books are filling up quickly for November. And as I said earlier, likely if there's some softness, certainly, our approach is going to be, we're going to have to build back a bit of inventory because of the impacts of weather and also just stronger demand. So let's see how it plays out, but it seems to me that, from our perspective, the increase is still on the table. \nOperator: Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. \nVincent Andrews: Just getting back to the polyethylene demand dynamics. If this year, let's just say, it finishes the year plus 1%, it's supposed to grow 4%. How do you think about next year? Do we have an above 4% year next year because some of the rebound maybe in the auto and industrial part as you suggested or do we just have had this air pocket this year and we don't make any of it up? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So Vincent, so U.S. PE demand so far year-to-date has grown about 1.7%. And if you look at Q3, the year-over-year is like 2.5%. So you can really see the higher level of demand growth post the low Q2. So I think Q2 was kind of a lost quarter.\n Just to kind of round out the regional look. In Europe, demand is up 2.5% year-to-date. And in China, it's up almost 5% year-to-date. And in China, imports are up about 5% year-to-date as well. So a really good growth rate globally in polyethylene. And to your point about, is there some catch-up growth next year, I do think in the industrial and auto areas. Now auto impacts polypropylene more than it does polyethylene. But I think when the recovery really takes hold, we should see above trend line growth for a year to 18 months. And I still expect that to be the case. We'll probably see that more dramatic in polypropylene just given that there's more durable good end-use in polypropylene. \nOperator: Next question is from Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. \nHassan Ahmed: Bob, wanted to sort of continue with some of your thoughts around polyethylene. I was taking a quick look at Chinese polyethylene import data that just came out for September. Imports were up 36% year-on-year. Month-on-month, they were up 17%. And obviously, that's with the backdrop of continued sort of supply additions out there. So as you look at the near term, call it, 2021 and things start sort of normalizing, but obviously, more capacity keeps coming online, how should we be thinking about the pace of Chinese polyethylene imports? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So if you look over the next 2 to 3 years, it seems that if you use historical demand growth, the new capacity likely won't be enough to meet demand growth. And so they're going to need to incrementally import more polyethylene. And we don't think imports have leveled out yet in China. And we think that will be the case. I don't know about next year because of timing of projects, whether they're delayed or not. But if I look over the next 2-, 3-year horizon, likely their import needs grow.\n Another thing to think about, Hassan, is that if you look at Q2 to Q3, as U.S. demand came back in polyethylene, exports actually declined significantly from Q2 to Q3 out of the U.S. And if you look at U.S. next year, there's very little new capacity in polyethylene coming online. So speaking to the prior question about, will we see higher demand growth in the U.S. if there's catch up demand, I think if that's the case, there will be less being exported out of the U.S. and likely that will create a tighter global market.\n And lastly, if you look out further on polyethylene supply/demand, you're already seeing many projects that are being canceled or delayed. So it seems to me that we're seeing kind of a classic setup of a cycle here as we sit in the trough. You're starting to see delays, starting see cancellations. And let's assume China brings on all of the capacity that's announced, they still need to import more. \nOperator: Next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. \nArun Viswanathan: I guess, I just wanted to go back to polypropylene. Could you just remind us how much of your portfolio is levered there across O&P-Americas, Europe and APS? And what is your outlook there? I guess you mentioned a lot of durables exposure, obviously, could remain quite depressed, especially if we go into another round of lockdowns. But maybe you can just offer your thoughts on the polypropylene market and the impact on LyondellBasell. \nBhavesh Patel: Certainly. So Arun, at a high level, polyethylene certainly is a bigger driver than polypropylene if I look globally. In the U.S., polyethylene is a bigger business for us than polypropylene. In Europe, polypropylene is a bit bigger than polyethylene, not by a lot. And in APS, post the acquisition of A. Schulman, we're much more diversified. Prior to the acquisition of A. Schulman, right, 100% of our compounding was essentially polypropylene and about 90% was automotive. And you will recall back when we announced that transaction, that was part of the rationale was to have more diversity and participation in the end use segments, in packaging, in medical and have more polyethylene content. So I'd say on APS, we're probably still 60% polypropylene, 40% other, just as kind of a rough breakdown.\n On the polypropylene outlook, certainly, polypropylene has struggled this year, especially in Q2 because of the higher durable good and auto content. Polypropylene demand is down year-to-date by 1% to 2% in Europe and U.S., up significantly, though, in China. So China polypropylene demand is up some 15%. It's a very, very large increase. So our view is that polypropylene will be very constructive. We don't see kind of a wall of supply. And actually, I think that as the economies recover around the world, durable goods will likely grow faster into a growing economy and a recovering economy, which probably favors polypropylene even more than polyethylene. \nOperator: Next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. \nKevin McCarthy: A financial question for you. It looks like your net debt balance increased about $425 million on a sequential basis. I heard you call out the payments to Bora. So if I adjust for that, the net debt would have trended flat to down, let's say. My question is, are there other issues, I don't know, working capital, timing issues, other onetime events that would have prevented you from deleveraging more in the third quarter? \nMichael McMurray: Yes, it's Michael. Yes, really Bora is the big one to call out. There's really nothing else of any significance to call out. \nBhavesh Patel: Kevin, if you look at this year, our operating cash flow will more than cover dividend and all the ongoing expenses. So we should have a surplus pre the Bora equity infusion. \nMichael McMurray: Yes. \nOperator: Next question is from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. \nFrank Mitsch: If I could just follow-up on that. Bob, you mentioned when you were talking about the Sasol JV that perhaps in the future you might acquire all of those assets. And obviously, you also discussed that the priority right now is to delever. How should we think about the potential timing of doing something with Sasol in the future? And then I guess, just kind of an overarching theme, should we think that Lyondell might do some more M&A in terms of making acquisitions in '21 or really will the delevering be front and center? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. Frank, so first of all, I just want to be real clear on our capital allocation priorities. Maximize cash flow, continuity of the dividend and solid investment-grade rating through the cycle, we're committed. Whatever we decide to do, we're committed to the dividend and the investment-grade rating. Having said all that, timing of a Step 2, probably 3 to 5 years out. So I think we have a window to delever before that decision is upon us.\n Now of course, a lot of that depends on the pace of the recovery, how much excess free cash flow we generate in '21, '22 and '23. But remember that Sasol, the first half of the JV will be contributing excess cash flow beyond the additional interest expense that we'll take on. So we think that will be accretive or additive to cash flow for next year. Based on our current outlook, we think next year we can cover the dividend from operating cash flow. So I think our priorities are going to be to delever, first and foremost. And I think there's enough time before the Step 2 will be upon us. We'll be able to delever meaningfully. \nOperator: Next question is from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. \nMichael Sison: I apologize if I misheard this, but I thought you mentioned that OP Americas would improve in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Hopefully, The Browns continue that rout as well. But when you think about that margin green in Slide 14, was the bulk of that achieved in September? And is that sort of the run rate as we head into the fourth quarter? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes, Mike. So the -- indeed, the timing of price increases, except for that last 5, most of it was implemented kind of later in the quarter as the way it all lays out. So I think that's probably a reasonable way to look at it is the September would be the run rate going into Q4. I think the thing we'll have to watch for is the seasonality. As I mentioned earlier in response to some of the other questions, my sense is that the market is so tight and the inventories are so low that I don't think we'll see the degree of seasonal softness that we've seen in past years this year, but let's see.\n And to your comment about The Browns, let's hope they continue to strengthen as we go into Q4. \nOperator: Next question is from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. \nJonas Oxgaard: Looking at the compounding business. So it sounds like your synergies are captured and automotive is coming back. Polymer prices are, for lack of a better word, normalizing. So can you give us a sense for how do you think about sustained or sustainable earnings in that business? And how are you thinking about a strategic outlook for it? Is this something you're looking at adding to? \nBhavesh Patel: Jonas, so first of all, on APS, I think you're really in Q3 starting to see what a fully synergized APS represents and the earnings power. As volume grows, more of those dollars will flow straight to the bottom line in a much more efficient platform post our synergies. If you go back to pre-COVID and around the time of the acquisition, the LyondellBasell business that was in APS, that is in APS today was earning at that time about $375 million of EBITDA. We acquired $200 million from A. Schulman, and we achieved $200 million of synergies. So nearly $800 million of EBITDA, that was kind of the run rate back in '18.\n So the question now is, what's the trajectory to get back to that kind of earnings rate? And I think, as you mentioned earlier, a lot of that will be tied to the recovery in automotive, looks very good in U.S. and in China. Europe needs to improve meaningfully for us to firmly be on the path to get to those kind of numbers that we had back in '18. But again, I think as volume increases, we should see a large part of that revenue fall to the bottom line on the margin because the fixed costs are now all covered and we have a synergized platform. So normalized earnings, if you go back to '18 conditions, should be closer to $800 million. \nOperator: Next question is from John Roberts with UBS. \nJohn Roberts: Do you need to write down the TBA assets as well like you wrote down the refinery? Or because it's integrated into the PO operations, the value doesn't need impairment? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So exactly, as you said, first of all, it's a co-product in our I&D business. But more importantly, John, the market characteristics for TBA are a bit different than what we see for our refinery because the margin in TBA is based on upgrading butane to MTBE. So whereas in the refinery, part of our margin is the light-heavy differential. And there, we think there's a longer road to recovery to get more sour crude back on the market. I would characterize the TBA downturn as cyclical and perhaps part of the refining downturn as being a little bit more lasting because of this lack of supply of sour crude. So we will not be writing down our PO/TBA or our TBA assets. Think of that as being more cyclical. \nOperator: The last question in the queue is from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. \nMatthew Blair: Are you still planning a refinery turnaround in 2021? And if so, can you share any details on the cost and the scope? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So Matthew, you've got us in the middle of thinking through that. So I'll be able to give you a definitive answer at the next earnings call. We're thinking through our cash needs for the company, how the markets will develop. We want to make a really thoughtful decision because we still think that our refinery is an asset that makes it through this downturn. So partly what I'm trying to balance here is near term versus long term and how do we position the refinery best for when markets do return. So we're going through all that math now. And certainly, we're going to do whatever we need to do to manage the regulatory requirements and all of the safety-related projects that we need to do. And those are a primary focus for us. And then beyond that, the turnaround timing is part of a broader set of decisions that we're trying to make next year for the refinery. So stay tuned. \nOperator: I'm showing no further questions at this time. \nBhavesh Patel: All right. Well, thank you. Well, let me offer a few closing remarks.\n Our team at LyondellBasell, we're continuing to focus on near term maximizing free cash flow, continue the dividend and maintaining a solid investment-grade rating through the cycle, as I've consistently mentioned over the past few calls. At the same time, I think we're really well positioned to emerge stronger from the pandemic because we'll have a lot more assets, a synergized APS platform, we'll have lower CapEx as we come out of the pandemic as well. And I think all that sets us up to really accelerate on free cash flow generation with our initial focus being on delevering. But I think our company is really setting up for coming out of this downturn in a very good way, much stronger than when we entered.\n So thank you for your interest in our company, and we'll look forward to updating you at the end of January, have a great weekend and be safe. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bhavesh Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. We hope that you, your colleagues and your families are all staying healthy and safe during these challenging times. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results.\n Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses benefited from improving volumes during the initial months of a recovering global economy. After excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory benefits and an impairment of our refinery, third quarter EBITDA was approximately $900 million, an improvement of more than $200 million relative to the second quarter. We continued to focus on cash generation and retention by efficiently converting more than 90% of our EBITDA into cash from operating activities and by carefully managing our working capital to end the quarter with approximately $5.5 billion of cash and available liquidity.\n Our strong balance sheet has served us well by allowing the company to capture opportunity during this downturn through the establishment and start-up of a new integrated polyolefin joint venture in China, followed by the announcement in October of our intent to form another integrated polyethylene joint venture in Louisiana before the end of this year. Both of these joint ventures offer unique opportunities for LyondellBasell to grow one of the core areas of our business by investing in new, already operating, high-quality assets that have significant upside as market conditions continue to improve. These transactions are prime examples of our strategy to identify, develop and capture opportunities through business cycles.\n Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. Our employees and contractors maintain their focus on performing work safely to eliminate injuries, prevent virus spread and minimize emissions from our assets. During September, we had one recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. Although our goal is always 0 injuries, the September year-to-date recordable injury rate across both our employees and contractors is on track to improve upon the top decile industry performance we achieved in 2019.\n Our protocols for workplace sanitization, facial covering, social distancing, health screening and contact tracing have been successful in minimizing the spread of coronavirus across our global facilities. We have no evidence of work-related COVID infections across our global workforce. Our major manufacturing locations operated continuously throughout the pandemic as an essential industry. Our office workers have returned to work in Asia, and we are gradually increasing our office populations across the rest of the world in accordance with local regulations and safety metrics, driven by both employee and community infection rates. We are using a safe and responsible approach to gradually increase the number of personnel at our Houston headquarters during the fourth quarter.\n In September, our company released our annual sustainability report, the cover of which is shown on Slide 5. We hope that you will all take some time to review the report. You will note that the cover image of our report does not depict images of solar arrays, wind mills or a pristine beach. Our products make modern life possible and often have a favorable environmental footprint relative to the alternatives. We recognize that plastic waste represents a substantial challenge for society, and our goal is to play a central role in developing pragmatic solutions that balance the needs for environmental, economic and social sustainability.\n Our sustainability report describes the actions we will take as a company to help tackle 3 global challenges: eliminating plastic waste, addressing climate change and supporting a thriving society. Over the next decade, we will continue to develop successful waste management projects through the Alliance to End Plastic Waste that will recover and reuse millions of tons of plastic waste. By 2030, we aim to produce 2 million tons of recycled and renewable polymers across our asset base. We are targeting a CO2 intensity that will be 15% lower by 2030 than it was in 2015. And the events of this year have led us to redouble our efforts to ensure a culture of inclusion across our diverse global workforce. We hope you will find that this year's report not only tracks our progress on meaningful metrics for investors, but also describes the increasing scope of our company's ambitions and strategies to support the transition to a low-carbon circular economy and drive solutions for a more sustainable and thriving society.\n Let's turn to Slide 6 and briefly review how we are advancing on our growth strategy with the Sasol joint venture that we announced on October 2. In summary, LyondellBasell has agreed to purchase a 50% interest in a newly built ethylene cracker, 2 polyethylene units and the associated utilities and infrastructure located in Lake Charles, Louisiana for $2 billion. LyondellBasell will operate the assets and market all of the polyethylene produced by this joint venture. As we discussed a few weeks ago, this transaction will enable both partners to maximize the value of these world-class assets while advancing our respective strategic objectives. While no formal process is set out in the agreements, LyondellBasell will have the potential to acquire the JV assets in full at some point in the future.\n In addition to the Louisiana joint venture, we also established and started up a joint venture with Bora in China just a few weeks ago. We have been very clear that we have no intention of building a new integrated ethylene cracker on our own for the foreseeable future. But when these 2 JVs in China and Louisiana are taken together, we are essentially acquiring the full capacity and immediate financial benefits of a new and operational world-scale integrated cracker complex with minimal exposure to the risk from project execution, timing uncertainty and opportunity costs that are typically incurred during the multiyear construction of these types of facilities. Plus, we are acquiring this world-scale integrated cracker at a very attractive valuation. With respect to our joint venture with Sasol, both partners are working diligently and making good progress towards obtaining the required approvals that should allow us to close the transaction before the end of this calendar year.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial results over the past quarter. Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our third quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the noncash LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery.\n Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continued to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the third quarter was nearly $900 million, more than $200 million higher than the prior quarter. The upward trajectory supports our belief that pandemic-driven reductions in demand for our products bottomed during the second quarter. Our Olefins and Polyolefins segments continue to serve strong consumer demand for products used in packaging and health care markets, while demand increased for intermediates and polymers used in durable goods applications. Volumes rebounded for compounded polymers from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment as automotive manufacturing reopened. Our Refining segment and the Oxyfuels & Related Products business continued to be challenged by decreased mobility that has reduced demand for transportation fuels. We expect that our diverse portfolio of businesses will see further improvement over the coming quarters as global economies continue on the path to recovery.\n Let's dig a little deeper on how the recovery is playing out in 2 significant markets for our company: polyethylene and transportation fuels. Let's turn to Slide 11 and review the growth in polyethylene demand during the pandemic. In a typical year, global polyethylene growth rate is approximately 4%. As you can see from the chart, in spite of the pandemic and recession, global polyethylene demand has still grown by 1% over the first 9 months of this year. As expected, Europe has seen a decline, but polyethylene demand in the U.S. and Canada and Northeast Asia regions has grown. Despite capacity additions, China demand will continue to far exceed its domestic production and incentivize North American exports. Low industry operating rates during the second quarter, along with Hurricane Laura in August and strong demand, tightened supply on the U.S. Gulf Coast, which led to polyethylene contract price increases totaling $420 per ton over the months of June through September. The recovery in demand for transportation fuels continues to be stubbornly slow.\n On Slide 12, you can see that while U.S. passenger and commercial vehicle travel has returned to within 10% of 2019 levels, U.S. flights and associated jet fuel consumption is still down by 40%. In March and April, refiners reduced operating rates in response to low demand and shifted distillate production from jet fuel to diesel. While gasoline and jet fuel inventories are currently at manageable levels, the excess distillate capacity has driven diesel inventories to levels 30% above the same period last year. Industry consultants believe that up to 3 million barrels of global refining capacity will need to be rationalized over the coming years to support more normalized margins since it is unlikely for airline travel to rebound to full utilization of the available refining capacity. As a result of an extended challenging outlook for refined product demand and margins, we recognized an impairment of the value of our refinery during the third quarter.\n Now let me summarize how these trends have come together for our company on Slide 13. In these initial months of economic recovery following the pandemic lockdowns, demand for our products has proven to be resilient. As you can see in the comparison to the third quarter of last year in the top chart, our sales volumes are largely intact. Further progress is needed to drive margin recovery.\n Comparing our performance relative to the second quarter in the bottom chart, you see the stepwise improvement. Volumes are up and margins have improved in all of our businesses, except for those serving transportation fuels markets. With continuing recovery in gasoline demand from passenger cars, we expect that our Oxyfuels business should recover more quickly than the broader refining market.\n Let's review the third quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results, excluding the noncash impacts of LCM inventory changes and the impairment of the Houston refinery. I will begin with our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment on Slide 14.\n Third quarter EBITDA was $404 million, $194 million higher than the second quarter. Improved demand for polyethylene and higher ethylene prices resulted in higher margins and volumes. Olefins results increased approximately $220 million compared to the second quarter. Industry ethylene supply tightened, which led to price increase that improved olefins margins. Volume increased due to higher demand and the completion of planned maintenance at our Channelview cracker in the second quarter. Polyolefin results increased by about $25 million during the third quarter. Increased polyethylene demand drove higher margin and volume, partially offset by a decrease in polypropylene margin. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P-Americas segment during the fourth quarter. Recent polyolefins price increases are expected to find support from industry supply constraints and robust demand. If global economies continue to improve, this momentum could persist for the remainder of the year.\n Now please turn to Slide 15 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. During the third quarter, EBITDA was $131 million, $88 million lower than the second quarter. Integrated profit margins were impacted by rising feedstock costs. Olefins results decreased approximately $30 million, driven by a decrease in margin. Ethylene margin decreased as higher feedstock costs outpaced an increase in ethylene prices. Combined polyolefins results decreased $20 million compared to the prior quarter. Polyethylene volume decreased due to summer demand and polypropylene margin declined on lower spreads. Although equity income decreased by approximately $10 million during the quarter, we were pleased to record a positive contribution for our Bora joint venture in September, the very first month of its operations. In October, we've seen a slight decline in integrated polyethylene margin. Over the fourth quarter, we expect a typical seasonal decline in demand as we approach the year-end holiday season.\n Please turn to Slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $245 million, $124 million higher than the prior quarter. Volumes rebounded with increased demand from durable goods markets in our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business and the completion of planned maintenance in the Intermediate Chemicals business. Third quarter Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results increased by approximately $45 million, driven by higher volumes from increased demand for polyurethanes in automotive, construction and furniture markets. Intermediate Chemicals results increased about $40 million, mostly driven by higher volumes after the completion of our planned maintenance. Oxyfuels & Related Products results increased approximately $10 million as a result of slightly higher margins due to higher product prices. In the coming quarter, stable demand for durable goods should continue to support profitability across most of the businesses in this segment. In October, oxyfuels prices and margins have come under additional pressure with lower seasonal driving demand.\n Now let's move on and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 17. Third quarter EBITDA was $117 million, $94 million higher than the second quarter. Volumes rebounded significantly, driven by higher demand for our products. Third quarter integration costs were $7 million. Compounding & Solutions results increased approximately $90 million due to higher volumes driven by increased demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end markets. Advanced Polymer's results were relatively unchanged. Although the demand for our products is improving, we expect typical seasonality to affect fourth quarter profitability for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment as activities in the automotive and construction market slowdown at the end of each calendar year.\n At our Investor Day last September, we updated our targets for synergies from the A. Schulman acquisition to $200 million. I'm happy to say that we have successfully implemented our synergy plan, and we believe that the annual run rate of more than $200 million will become increasingly visible with volume recovery in this segment.\n Now let's turn to Slide 18 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was negative $121 million, a $107 million decrease versus the second quarter of 2020. As I discussed earlier, this excludes the impact of both LCM and the onetime impairment of the Houston refinery. Results for the quarter were pressured by excess industry capacity and reduced demand for transportation fuels.\n In the third quarter, lower demand for gasoline and jet fuel negatively impacted both margins and volumes. Margins declined in the third quarter due to the absence of a hedging gain recorded in the second quarter, unfavorable byproduct spreads and a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread. During the quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread decreased to as low as $7.75 per barrel and ended at a historically low quarterly average of $9.89 per barrel. In response to sluggish demand, we reduced the utilization rate at the refinery to 81%, with an average crude throughput of 216,000 barrels per day. Refining margins are expected to remain compressed until demand for gasoline and jet fuel returns closer to pre-COVID levels. We plan to operate the refinery at about 80% of nameplate crude capacity during the fourth quarter.\n Let me be clear that we are leaving no stone unturned in our efforts to reduce expenses and minimize losses at the refinery. We are deferring nonsafety-related discretionary activities and reducing the salaried workforce by approximately 10% at our refinery through early retirements and potential worker redeployments to our other facilities in the Houston area. We are evaluating every possible option with regard to procuring crude oil and optimizing production from this asset.\n Please turn to Slide 19 as we review the results of our Technology segment. Third quarter Technology segment EBITDA was comparable to the prior quarter at $111 million. Licensing revenues increased, while catalyst margin and volume decreased. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that the fourth quarter Technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter of this year.\n Please turn to Slide 20 and allow me to review the progress of our value-driven growth investments. Our company is executing on a very clear and simple strategy: to increase free cash flow by harvesting new sources of EBITDA generation while moderating our capital expenditures. Earlier this year, we accelerated our plans to reduce capital expenditures to $2 billion or less. We intend to maintain our capital budget at these levels for the next 3 years.\n In the second quarter, we started a 500,000-ton per year polyethylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation Hyperzone HDPE technology. At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this asset is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA.\n On September 1, we established a new joint venture in Northeastern China with Bora. This investment has already contributed earnings in September, and recent margins indicate the joint venture is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our company.\n In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and we formed the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. With integration completed, we are on track to capture $200 million in estimated synergies that should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the markets served by this segment.\n We expect to close the transaction for the Louisiana joint venture with Sasol before the end of this year. At full capacity and historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA to our company.\n In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, the combination of 2 new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023 could together add almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. The formula is very simple. More EBITDA and moderating capital expenditures should result in higher free cash flow at any point in the business cycle.\n Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook with Slide 21. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged global positions enabled us to capture value and deliver resilient results. We demonstrated commercial agility by matching production with continued demand from packaging and health care markets and increasing volumes from automotive and other durable goods markets. We are seeing higher demand for our products from recovering global economies. Our North America polyethylene exports are increasing to support growing demand in Asia. Markets for discretionary durable goods are improving.\n As global mobility increases, the demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually show improvement. Our financial strategy continues to support our commitment to an investment-grade rating. With sound cash generation and disciplined capital deployment decisions, we are focused on maintaining the continuity of our dividend and prioritizing deleveraging upon completion of the Sasol transaction. Our goal at LyondellBasell is to capture opportunities throughout all points of business cycles. Over the past several years, we have carefully planted the seeds for profit-generating growth by building, acquiring and partnering on assets that expand our reach with new capabilities to sustainably harvest profitability from advantaged feedstocks, expanded product ranges and an increased footprint in the world's fastest-growing markets. We look forward to discussing our progress on maximizing cash flow from these investments over the coming quarters.\n We are now pleased to take your questions. John, indeed, especially in polyethylene, as you noted, this year -- and polypropylene, to an extent, this year, because of the hurricanes, and prior to that, the inventory reduction that we undertook as a company and generally as an industry, likely if there's some slowdown in demand, certainly, we, as a company, will take the opportunity to rebuild some inventory. We're at very, very low levels today and really kind of hand to mouth on many products. And I suspect that, that will get us through the seasonally soft period and get into next year. So I suspect that will be the case in polyolefins for the most part. Yes. So Steve, the $150 million will be at the EBITDA level. So it's like equity earnings. Think of it that way. We do not expect dividends from Bora for a couple of years because the priority will be to delever. You will recall that the financing was roughly 1/3 equity, 2/3 debt for Bora. So the way we've outlined the joint venture and how the bank covenants work, we need to prioritize delevering first. We'll get some incremental commission income from the sales of polyolefins. The likely dividend income will come in year 3, 4 and onwards. Yes, Jeff. So it may, but I think right now what's driving global petrochemical prices and especially polyolefin prices, it's more about the heightened level of demand that we've seen, very low levels of inventory. And I think that's really what's going to drive near-term pricing and provide support potentially for the final increase that's been announced here in the U.S.\n The other thing to note about a falling oil price is that it should benefit our European business. Because typically when oil price declines, we see margins open up in Europe. We saw the opposite of that in Q3 as oil prices actually increased, and we saw a bit of margin squeeze as we couldn't pass all of that through to the end users. So I think net, probably a benefit for Europe and near-term supply/demand likely drives pricing more so than Brent price. Yes. Aleksey, right now because there's so many moving parts, I hesitate to give you a normalized number. I think you've put your finger on a few of the drivers, which is the direction of oil price. Also, Europe has been one of the softer regions in the world. We've seen improvement in Europe from Q2 to Q3, but it has not been to the degree that we've seen in China and the U.S. So I would say more of a mixed market in Europe and more clear strength in the U.S. and in China. Well, let's wait until next quarter and we'll try to help you with that normalized number, but today I hesitate just given all the moving parts. Duffy, on the refinery, book value will be a little over $500 million, and we'll post that in our Q later today or Monday. So that's after the write-down. On the PO/TBA project, certainly, returns will be lower, we think, probably in the 10% range on returns for PO/TBA. I think in the end, we're going to net out kind of the delay of the project in this way. I think, first of all, it gave us some cushion on cash flow this year that given the uncertainty at the time we made the decision back in Q2, I still continue to believe it was the right thing to do. Secondly, when we do start up, it will be timed better when markets are recovering or fully recovered, hopefully by then. And we'll be bringing new capacity online at a time where it's more likely to be needed. So in the end, I think balancing near-term needs with long-term market demand, I think this was the right call to make, and we continue to believe it was the right call. So from our perspective, we really saw the industrial part of the demand be very weak. And you will recall that the automotive sector was essentially shut down. For example, we produce polyethylene that goes into fuel tanks. And so that's continued to be weak. The automotive sector has not come back in Europe as strongly as it has in the U.S., industrial bulk containers, things like that. So the industrial part of demand was softer in Europe.\n I think on the packaging side, we saw similar strength of what we've seen in the U.S. So it's more about the level of activity. It didn't resume to the rate that we had expected. And lastly, in Q3, we still saw some seasonal slowdown from a typical European holiday season. There's the European kind of vacation season where some of the factories shut down. There was still some of that and enough that it caused some seasonality in Q3. Bob, so first of all, we estimate that ethane rejection rates are still pretty high, probably north of 500,000 barrels per day. I've heard numbers much higher, almost double that. But likely, the rejection is probably happening in regions that are further away from the Gulf Coast. So there's probably some in the Permian, but probably more as you get out towards the Rockies and certainly in the Marcellus. So today, you see ethane in the low 20s. I wouldn't be surprised to see ethane move to the mid-20s, especially here in the winter as natural gas prices rise a little bit more. I don't think we'll see a spike only because higher prices will likely incent more supply to come online. And maybe, as you say, with more crackers starting up, we may, on the margin, need more supply from further away regions. And if that were to happen, then maybe ethane does move to the mid-20s. But I still think there's so much rejection out there that a little bit of price will incent more supply. Well, so David, first of all, there are kind of timing effects on when these price increases get implemented, and it's phased over a 2-month period depending on contracts and size of buyer and that sort of thing. But if you kind of step back and look at the market environment today, as I mentioned earlier, inventories are still really low. And in fact, this morning, I was just looking at ACC data and days on hand is like 10% lower than where it was last year. And that's days on hand, so including a lower sales rate, the absolute inventory levels are incredibly low today. So I think that points to a tighter market.\n Secondly, we don't see demand really letting up yet. Our order books are filling up quickly for November. And as I said earlier, likely if there's some softness, certainly, our approach is going to be, we're going to have to build back a bit of inventory because of the impacts of weather and also just stronger demand. So let's see how it plays out, but it seems to me that, from our perspective, the increase is still on the table. Yes. So Vincent, so U.S. PE demand so far year-to-date has grown about 1.7%. And if you look at Q3, the year-over-year is like 2.5%. So you can really see the higher level of demand growth post the low Q2. So I think Q2 was kind of a lost quarter.\n Just to kind of round out the regional look. In Europe, demand is up 2.5% year-to-date. And in China, it's up almost 5% year-to-date. And in China, imports are up about 5% year-to-date as well. So a really good growth rate globally in polyethylene. And to your point about, is there some catch-up growth next year, I do think in the industrial and auto areas. Now auto impacts polypropylene more than it does polyethylene. But I think when the recovery really takes hold, we should see above trend line growth for a year to 18 months. And I still expect that to be the case. We'll probably see that more dramatic in polypropylene just given that there's more durable good end-use in polypropylene. Yes. So if you look over the next 2 to 3 years, it seems that if you use historical demand growth, the new capacity likely won't be enough to meet demand growth. And so they're going to need to incrementally import more polyethylene. And we don't think imports have leveled out yet in China. And we think that will be the case. I don't know about next year because of timing of projects, whether they're delayed or not. But if I look over the next 2-, 3-year horizon, likely their import needs grow.\n Another thing to think about, Hassan, is that if you look at Q2 to Q3, as U.S. demand came back in polyethylene, exports actually declined significantly from Q2 to Q3 out of the U.S. And if you look at U.S. next year, there's very little new capacity in polyethylene coming online. So speaking to the prior question about, will we see higher demand growth in the U.S. if there's catch up demand, I think if that's the case, there will be less being exported out of the U.S. and likely that will create a tighter global market.\n And lastly, if you look out further on polyethylene supply/demand, you're already seeing many projects that are being canceled or delayed. So it seems to me that we're seeing kind of a classic setup of a cycle here as we sit in the trough. You're starting to see delays, starting see cancellations. And let's assume China brings on all of the capacity that's announced, they still need to import more. Certainly. So Arun, at a high level, polyethylene certainly is a bigger driver than polypropylene if I look globally. In the U.S., polyethylene is a bigger business for us than polypropylene. In Europe, polypropylene is a bit bigger than polyethylene, not by a lot. And in APS, post the acquisition of A. Schulman, we're much more diversified. Prior to the acquisition of A. Schulman, right, 100% of our compounding was essentially polypropylene and about 90% was automotive. And you will recall back when we announced that transaction, that was part of the rationale was to have more diversity and participation in the end use segments, in packaging, in medical and have more polyethylene content. So I'd say on APS, we're probably still 60% polypropylene, 40% other, just as kind of a rough breakdown.\n On the polypropylene outlook, certainly, polypropylene has struggled this year, especially in Q2 because of the higher durable good and auto content. Polypropylene demand is down year-to-date by 1% to 2% in Europe and U.S., up significantly, though, in China. So China polypropylene demand is up some 15%. It's a very, very large increase. So our view is that polypropylene will be very constructive. We don't see kind of a wall of supply. And actually, I think that as the economies recover around the world, durable goods will likely grow faster into a growing economy and a recovering economy, which probably favors polypropylene even more than polyethylene. Kevin, if you look at this year, our operating cash flow will more than cover dividend and all the ongoing expenses. So we should have a surplus pre the Bora equity infusion. Yes. Frank, so first of all, I just want to be real clear on our capital allocation priorities. Maximize cash flow, continuity of the dividend and solid investment-grade rating through the cycle, we're committed. Whatever we decide to do, we're committed to the dividend and the investment-grade rating. Having said all that, timing of a Step 2, probably 3 to 5 years out. So I think we have a window to delever before that decision is upon us.\n Now of course, a lot of that depends on the pace of the recovery, how much excess free cash flow we generate in '21, '22 and '23. But remember that Sasol, the first half of the JV will be contributing excess cash flow beyond the additional interest expense that we'll take on. So we think that will be accretive or additive to cash flow for next year. Based on our current outlook, we think next year we can cover the dividend from operating cash flow. So I think our priorities are going to be to delever, first and foremost. And I think there's enough time before the Step 2 will be upon us. We'll be able to delever meaningfully. Yes, Mike. So the -- indeed, the timing of price increases, except for that last 5, most of it was implemented kind of later in the quarter as the way it all lays out. So I think that's probably a reasonable way to look at it is the September would be the run rate going into Q4. I think the thing we'll have to watch for is the seasonality. As I mentioned earlier in response to some of the other questions, my sense is that the market is so tight and the inventories are so low that I don't think we'll see the degree of seasonal softness that we've seen in past years this year, but let's see.\n And to your comment about The Browns, let's hope they continue to strengthen as we go into Q4. Jonas, so first of all, on APS, I think you're really in Q3 starting to see what a fully synergized APS represents and the earnings power. As volume grows, more of those dollars will flow straight to the bottom line in a much more efficient platform post our synergies. If you go back to pre-COVID and around the time of the acquisition, the LyondellBasell business that was in APS, that is in APS today was earning at that time about $375 million of EBITDA. We acquired $200 million from A. Schulman, and we achieved $200 million of synergies. So nearly $800 million of EBITDA, that was kind of the run rate back in '18.\n So the question now is, what's the trajectory to get back to that kind of earnings rate? And I think, as you mentioned earlier, a lot of that will be tied to the recovery in automotive, looks very good in U.S. and in China. Europe needs to improve meaningfully for us to firmly be on the path to get to those kind of numbers that we had back in '18. But again, I think as volume increases, we should see a large part of that revenue fall to the bottom line on the margin because the fixed costs are now all covered and we have a synergized platform. So normalized earnings, if you go back to '18 conditions, should be closer to $800 million. Yes. So exactly, as you said, first of all, it's a co-product in our I&D business. But more importantly, John, the market characteristics for TBA are a bit different than what we see for our refinery because the margin in TBA is based on upgrading butane to MTBE. So whereas in the refinery, part of our margin is the light-heavy differential. And there, we think there's a longer road to recovery to get more sour crude back on the market. I would characterize the TBA downturn as cyclical and perhaps part of the refining downturn as being a little bit more lasting because of this lack of supply of sour crude. So we will not be writing down our PO/TBA or our TBA assets. Think of that as being more cyclical. Yes. So Matthew, you've got us in the middle of thinking through that. So I'll be able to give you a definitive answer at the next earnings call. We're thinking through our cash needs for the company, how the markets will develop. We want to make a really thoughtful decision because we still think that our refinery is an asset that makes it through this downturn. So partly what I'm trying to balance here is near term versus long term and how do we position the refinery best for when markets do return. So we're going through all that math now. And certainly, we're going to do whatever we need to do to manage the regulatory requirements and all of the safety-related projects that we need to do. And those are a primary focus for us. And then beyond that, the turnaround timing is part of a broader set of decisions that we're trying to make next year for the refinery. So stay tuned. All right. Well, thank you. Well, let me offer a few closing remarks.\n Our team at LyondellBasell, we're continuing to focus on near term maximizing free cash flow, continue the dividend and maintaining a solid investment-grade rating through the cycle, as I've consistently mentioned over the past few calls. At the same time, I think we're really well positioned to emerge stronger from the pandemic because we'll have a lot more assets, a synergized APS platform, we'll have lower CapEx as we come out of the pandemic as well. And I think all that sets us up to really accelerate on free cash flow generation with our initial focus being on delevering. But I think our company is really setting up for coming out of this downturn in a very good way, much stronger than when we entered.\n So thank you for your interest in our company, and we'll look forward to updating you at the end of January, have a great weekend and be safe."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.\n Please turn to Slide 7. While the recession and subsequent recovery has presented challenges for our business, we have also found great opportunities in the debt capital markets to reduce our interest costs and extend maturities by refinancing some of our debt as we raise capital to support the formation of the Louisiana joint venture. Immediately after announcing our agreement with Sasol, we renegotiated covenants, extended our revolving credit facility by 1 year and issued $3.9 billion in new bonds. These bonds were very well received by the market with an order book that was more than 5x oversubscribed. We locked in favorable rates with a weighted average coupon of 2.72% across 6 tranches with maturities ranging from 3 to 40 years. The new bonds serve to reduce the weighted average interest rate across our debt portfolio by 34 basis points. After redemptions planned for the coming days, we will have both accessible near-term maturities as well as staggered long-term maturities without any large maturity towers.\n With the completion of the Sasol joint venture, we will prioritize deleveraging over share repurchases and work toward improving debt ratios to levels consistent with a stronger investment-grade credit rating. We expect to continue to fund our dividend primarily from operating cash flows. One more modeling item, in the fourth quarter, we'll have a charge of approximately $80 million for loss on extinguishment of debt associated with our refinancing activities.\n As Bob mentioned, our cash conversion remained strong in the third quarter. On Slide 8, you can see that over the last 12 months, more than 100% of our EBITDA was converted into nearly $4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our business teams remain highly focused on aggressively managing inventories through these dynamic markets while prioritizing cash generation and liquidity.\n Now please turn to Slide 9, where we provide further details on cash generation during the third quarter. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $2.8 billion. Capital expenditures of $425 million declined more than 25% relative to the second quarter, largely due to the reduced pace of construction on our new PO/TBA facility in Houston.\n In March, we announced that we were reducing activity on the PO/TBA project to both prevent virus spread at the construction site and conserve capital as we prepared for an uncertain economic environment from the pandemic. We have recently begun to reactivate the project and expect to return to a full pace over the coming weeks. We now expect the project to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022, approximately 1 year later than our original schedule. The delayed timing of the start-up should provide benefits from a more fully recovered global economy as well as another year of global demand growth for the products. Higher costs arising from the delayed project execution, more extensive civil construction and unexpected tariffs on materials are expected to add at least 30% to our original cost estimate of $2.4 billion. We plan to provide a more definitive update on the estimated cost after activity is fully restored on the project early next year.\n In the third quarter, we also funded the $472 million equity contribution for our joint venture with Bora in China and paid $352 million in dividends to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with $5.5 billion of cash and available liquidity.\n The recognition of the impairment of our refinery during the third quarter has substantially changed the math for computing our 2020 forecasted tax rate. We now believe that our effective tax rate will be significantly lower than our prior guidance of a less than mid-teens percentage rate. Due to the uncertainty regarding the impact of the CARES Act and the timing of certain discrete events, we will not be providing more specific guidance at this time. On the other hand, the refinery impairment has resulted in our cash tax rate being higher than previously communicated. While it's difficult to forecast a specific percentage, we expect that our cash tax payments, net of refunds for 2020, will be approximately $200 million.\n With that, I'll turn the call over to Bob. Yes, it's Michael. Yes, really Bora is the big one to call out. There's really nothing else of any significance to call out. Yes."

[Operator Instructions] \n I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. \nDavid Kinney: Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Second Quarter 2020 Teleconference. I am joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. \n Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. \n We will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. \n Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until September 1 by calling (800) 879-4299 in the United States and (203) 369-3561 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 7410. \n During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. \n Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower op cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last-in, first-out or LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the second quarter, we've recognized pretax LCM benefits totaling $96 million compared to LCM charges of $419 million in the first quarter. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. \n With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob. \nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. I hope that you, your colleagues and your families are all staying healthy during these challenging times. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. \n Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. LyondellBasell's employees leveraged our core strengths in operational excellence, cost management and commercial agility to generate $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities during an extremely challenging quarter. This represents an improvement of over $100 million relative to the second quarter of 2019 despite our significantly lower earnings. \n During the second quarter, our team rapidly responded to weakening market conditions by aggressively reducing inventory to match lower levels of demand that reduced cash working capital by $575 million. We developed plans to reduce CapEx by approximately $500 million during the year. This includes slowing down of our PO/TBA project. We also made significant progress on cost-reduction efforts towards our goal of a run rate of $150 million to $200 million in recurring annual savings by the end of this year. \n We have quickly adapted to changing conditions in our markets, workplaces and communities to ensure that our assets continue to operate safely and serve the dynamic needs of our customers. LyondellBasell's products support many of society's critical needs such as melt-blown fibers for N95 face masks, alcohols for sanitizers and packaging that prevents the contamination and spoilage of our food I'm very thankful for the innovative thinking, tireless dedication and disciplined approach to health and safety exhibited by our employees around the world to ensure that we continue to serve our customers and protect our communities during these difficult times. \n Our second quarter EBITDA of nearly $700 million represents a decline of nearly 40% relative to the first quarter and almost 60% relative to the second quarter of last year. These results are reflective of pandemic-driven declines in demand and margins across many of the markets we serve, especially in transportation fuels and products used in automotive manufacturing and other durable goods end markets. \n Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to health and safety has become even more relevant to our employees, contractors and communities during the coronavirus pandemic. We leveraged the early experience from our employees in the Asia Pacific region to develop protocols for workplace sanitization, facial covering, social distancing, health screening and contact tracing to minimize the spread of virus across our global facilities. \n Although we have limited influence in our surrounding communities, our processes have proven highly effective in limiting virus spread within our workplaces. Our employees have continued to deliver top-quartile, if not top-decile, safety performance while adopting these additional pandemic-related protocols. \n In June, our company was honored to receive the American Chemistry Council's highest distinction the Responsible Care Company of the Year award. The award recognized our innovative practices and leadership in the areas of environmental, health, safety and security. This honor is a direct reflection of the dedication of our entire LyondellBasell team and their work to ensure that the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate are always our highest priorities. \n The pandemic has generated a renewed appreciation for the value of our chemical and polymer products for society. At the same time, LyondellBasell has not retreated from our commitment to developing circular and sustainable business models for our products. \n Let's turn to Slide 5, where we highlight our progress on molecular recycling. \n LyondellBasell's mechanical recycling business model is focused on forming partnerships with waste management companies who can clean and sort plastic waste, enabling the production of premium recycled plastics. Nonetheless, we recognize that many plastic products are composed of multiple materials that cannot be easily sorted in the pure waste streams.  Late last year, we announced our initiative to develop a new proprietary technology called MoReTec to convert mixed plastic waste into a feedstock we could use in our existing assets to produce new chemicals and polymers. On Slide 5, you can see we have already scaled up this technology from the laboratory to a pilot plant that we commissioned during July in Ferrara, Italy. Our aim is to advance our catalyzed process technology to an industrial scale that will enable the production of monomer feedstock from waste plastic that is competitive with naphtha-based economics. MoReTec could provide another option for satisfying growing demand for circular plastics produced without fossil-based feedstocks. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial performance. \nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our company continued to generate substantial cash during the second quarter. \n Slide 6 illustrates our cash flow performance over the past 5 years. During this time, we have consistently generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities on an annual basis. Over the last 12 months, more than 110% of our EBITDA was converted into cash from operating activities. With approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditures dedicated to maintaining our assets and $5 billion in cash from operating activities, our free operating cash flow yield remained strong at 17.6%. Our team is aggressively managing inventories through dynamic markets while prioritizing cash generation and liquidity. \n Now please turn to Slide 7, where we provide further details on cash generation during the second quarter. You can see that our businesses generated $1.3 billion cash from operating activities, up more than $100 million from 1 year ago, despite our significantly lower earnings. During the second quarter, we increased our cash on hand to $3.2 billion with a $2 billion bond issuance in April at very attractive rates. Capital expenditures of $588 million declined more than 10% compared to the first quarter as we began to slow activities on the PO/TBA plant construction. \n In the second quarter, we paid $350 million in dividends to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $5.8 billion of cash and available liquidity. With strong cash generation and ample liquidity, we remain confident in our ability to fund our dividend, primarily from operating cash flows. \n As announced during the prior quarter, we rapidly developed strategies to respond to a variety of economic scenarios. Slide 8 illustrates our actions to reduce capital expenditures in 2020 by approximately $500 million. In addition to slowing the PO/TBA activities, we have also deferred planned maintenance during the pandemic. You may recall from our Investor Day last September that our plan was to reduce capital expenditures to $1.9 billion by 2022. We are accelerating this program and now plan to achieve this target 2 years ahead of schedule. \n Let's continue to Slide 9 and summarize the impact of these initiatives. The combination of lower capital expenditures, reduced discretionary spending and cash released from working capital is expected to improve our 2020 free cash flow by as much as $1.1 billion. We are also pursuing further optimization of our low-cost structure by accelerating cost-efficiency initiatives. With our disciplined approach to capital deployment and about $5.8 billion in cash and available liquidity, we believe the company is well positioned for this dynamic market environment. \n Before I turn the call over to Bob, allow me to provide an update on the annual financial modeling guidance that we discussed last quarter. We now expect that our 2020 effective tax rate will be lower than our previous guidance of a mid-teens percentage rate. The lower effective rate is related to both reduced profitability and favorable impacts from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES Act. The net impact of the CARES Act on the company for the full year is expected to be favorable. The 2020 cash tax rate is expected to remain in line with our previously committed estimate of a mid- to high-teens percentage rate. \n With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob? \nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our second quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these  LCM inventory changes. \n Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continue to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the second quarter was nearly $700 million. The global response to limit the spread of COVID-19 reduced demand and margins for many of our products. Our Olefin and Polyolefin segments rapidly responded to increased demand for our products used in consumer-driven packaging and health care while reducing production for polymers used in durable goods applications with falling demand. \n Our Intermediates and Derivatives, Refining and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments were impacted by the significant reduction in demand for transportation fuels and polymers utilized in automotive and other durable goods segments. The resiliency of our business portfolio continues to benefit from our relatively high participation in markets with consumer-driven demand for nondurable products and our global market reach. \n Let's review our second quarter results, starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 11. Second quarter EBITDA was $210 million, $267 million lower than the first quarter. The pandemic reduced demand for polyethylene from export markets and polyolefins for durable goods markets, resulting in margin and volume declines. \n Olefins results decreased approximately $230 million compared to the first quarter. Margins declined on lower coal product prices, particularly for butadiene and other C4s. As discussed in our first quarter call, we reduced our ethylene operating rates to about 75% of nameplate capacity for the second quarter to address weaker demand. Ethane made up 60% of our ethylene cracker feed slate during the quarter as weak demand for butadiene and other coal products offset the advantages of cracking low-priced naphtha feedstock. Polyolefins results decreased about $45 million during the second quarter, driven by declines in both margins and volumes. \n We believe the pandemic-driven declines in demand bottomed during the second quarter. We are seeing improvements in pricing and volumes as global economies reopen and demand for polyethylene exports and durable goods returns. We expect to operate our U.S. ethylene crackers at nearly full rates of 95% of nameplate capacity during the third quarter. \n With that, let's turn to Slide 12 and take a look at recent developments in feedstock costs around the world. As illustrated in the chart, during 2019, the cost of ethylene production in both North America and the Middle East remain highly advantaged relative to naphtha-based costs in Europe and the rest of the world. This has been the familiar shape of the global cost curve since U.S. shale oil and gas production came online over the prior decade. \n The small amount of ethylene produced by methanol to olefins technology in China is typically on the high end of the cost curve. In March and April, crude oil prices rapidly fell in response to both reduced fuel demand from the pandemic and increased crude production as Saudi Arabia and Russia sought to pressure higher-cost oil producers. When naphtha-based costs became favored during March and April, some speculated that the curve would have remained inverted, eliminating the U.S. shale gas advantage. \n As economies began reopening during May and June, the cost curve quickly regained slope and reasserted the advantage of Middle East and North American feedstocks. North America has an abundance of ethane and other natural gas liquid resources. While events may occasionally depress oil prices and temporarily invert the cost curve, we continue to believe that North American producers will typically have advantage for the foreseeable future. \n Looking at the polypropylene market on Slide 13. We are seeing indications of increased demand from the automotive market as well as continued strength in packaging orders. Approximately 15% of LyondellBasell's North American polypropylene business serves the automotive market by either providing base resins to our downstream Advanced Polymer Solutions segment or through direct sales to third-party manufacturers of vehicle components. \n In the first half of this year, automotive manufacturers shut down production to limit virus spread and then reopened, first in China, later in Europe, and then the United States. China's progress can be seen by June 2020 new vehicle tire demand that is 11% higher than the same month last year. In Europe and the U.S., June 2020 new vehicle production remains down by 31% and 26%, respectively, relative to pre-COVID forecasts. \n The progress in North American automotive demand for polypropylene can be seen in the chart on the right that tracks our order books for these applications. Demand has risen sharply during June and July as automotive manufacturers resumed production. In addition, LyondellBasell's polypropylene orders for consumer-driven packaging applications have remained at the elevated levels we have seen through the pandemic with 20% higher demand from packaging markets during the first half of the year. \n Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was $219 million, $6 million lower than the first quarter. Despite reduced demand as a result of the pandemic, integrated profit margins remained relatively stable.  Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million driven by a decrease in both margin and volume. Ethylene margin decreased as reductions in ethylene and pulp product prices outpaced declining feedstock costs. Volume decreased following strong production in the prior quarter, coupled with lower demand in the second quarter. Our European crackers operated at 84% of capacity during the quarter. \n Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million compared to the prior quarter. Margins improved and were partially offset by a decrease in polypropylene volumes due to reduced demand from automotive and other durable goods markets. \n Higher margins in our joint ventures contributed to an increase in equity income of approximately $55 million. Increased demand for melt-blown polypropylene used in N95 face masks and other medical applications drove improved demand and margins for our PolyMirae joint venture in South Korea. \n In the coming quarter, we expect margins to decrease due to higher feedstock costs. We expect that our European crackers will operate at about 90% of nameplate capacity during the third quarter as some of our competitors in the region are expected to be down for planned maintenance. \n Please turn to Slide 15 for an update of our new Chinese integrated cracker joint venture with Bora. Over the past few weeks, the construction team handed off the project to the operations team for commissioning during August. Although most of the ethylene feedstock will be naphtha supplied by our partner's adjacent refinery, the cracker also has flexibility to utilize LPG feedstocks from global sources, and this slide shows the first delivery of an LPG cargo to the cracker a few weeks ago in preparation for our start-up. Our equity contribution to the joint venture is expected to occur during the third quarter. This joint venture investment allows LyondellBasell to rapidly expand in the world's fastest-growing market for our products. \n Please turn to Slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $121 million, $160 million lower than the prior quarter. As we expected, second quarter results reflect a significant reduction in gasoline and other durable goods demand that impacted both margins and volume for oxyfuels and related products as well as propylene oxide and derivative volumes. Second quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased approximately $55 million due to lower volumes from reduced demand for polyurethanes in automotive, construction and furniture markets. \n Intermediate chemicals results were relatively flat. Oxyfuels and related products results decreased approximately $95 million as a result of lower margins and lower volumes. Margins were compressed by lower gasoline prices. Volumes declined due to lower demand for automotive fuels and isobutylene. \n We anticipate that demand for transportation fuels will improve in the third quarter. Profitability for our oxyfuels and related products business is expected to follow but not to the typical high levels we normally realize during the summer driving season. \n With that, let's turn to Slide 17 and look at some positive indicators in the demand for transportation fuels. In the U.S., stay-at-home closures largely occurred over the months of March and April, with the reopenings beginning in May. This can be seen in the chart as vehicle miles traveled bottomed during April. Summer driving and reopening increased vehicle mileage for June to be about 95% of what it was in February. In addition, increased consumption is reducing gasoline inventories, allowing for a gradual improvement in refinery operating rates. While we may need to moderate reopening progress to control virus spread, the trends support improving supply and demand balances for transportation fuels that should be constructive for profitability going forward. \n Now let's move on and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA was $23 million, $92 million lower than the first quarter. Volumes declined significantly as a result of pandemic-related shutdowns at automotive manufacturers. We temporarily idled production at several of our small compounding plants in the APS segment to respond to reduced demand. \n Second quarter pretax integration costs were $16 million. Compounding and solutions results decreased approximately $75 million due to lower volumes driven by decreased demand for polymer compounds from the automotive sector. Advanced Polymers results decreased about $10 million due to lower demand in the construction and automotive end markets. \n Automotive manufacturers partially resumed production at their facilities in the latter part of the second quarter. As a result, we expect third quarter profitability for the segment to benefit from returning demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end markets. \n During July, we restarted most of our idle plants, and we plan to operate our compounding capacity at rates that match downstream automotive demand. \n Now let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was negative $14 million, a $66 million improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. Results were pressured by a significant reduction in transportation fuel demand as the U.S. implemented measures to reduce the spread of the virus. In the second quarter, margins improved as prices of coke and sulfur co-products from our refinery held up relative to the falling prices of crude oil. We also benefited from mark-to-market gains from a hedge on a portion of our crude oil purchases. These improvements were partially offset by a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark frac spread to an average of $13.27 per barrel. \n Average crude throughput increased by 11,000 barrels per day to 237,000 barrels per day with the resumption of operations at our fluidized catalytic factory unit during April. We anticipate that reduced demand for gasoline and jet fuel will continue to pressure our Refining margins until demand approaches pre-COVID levels. We are planning to operate the refinery at 85% to 90% of nameplate crude throughput during the third quarter. \n Please turn to Slide 20 as we review the results of our Technology segment. During the second quarter, Technology segment EBITDA was $112 million, an increase of $56 million compared to the prior quarter. Licensing revenues increased -- catalyst volumes also increased as customers stopped inventories early in the pandemic. Our Technology segment licenses polymer production technologies for new manufacturing plants that enable subsequent catalyst sales to licensing customers over the lifetime of the asset. \n Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones results in an uneven pace for licensing revenues. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming milestones, we expect that third quarter licensing profitability will be comparable to the same quarter last year. \n Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook on Slide 21. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged global positions continued to deliver resilient results during a challenging market environment. We demonstrated commercial agility by pivoting production towards increased demand from packaging and health care markets while aggressively managing inventories for products affected by shutdowns in the automotive and other durable goods manufacturing. Our foundations in leveraging low operating costs and optimal asset utilization serves us well during any point in the cycle. \n Our capital deployment strategy continues to provide support for our dividend through efficient cash generation and disciplined allocation of capital expenditures for required maintenance and selective profit-generating growth. All capital deployment decisions remain grounded in our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. \n We believe the pandemic-driven decline in demand bottomed during the second quarter. Demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually rebound as global economies continue to reopen. Markets for discretionary durable goods are improving but will likely take longer to recover from the downturn. We expect that strong consumer-driven demand for our products in packaging and medical applications will continue over the near to medium term. LyondellBasell is addressing these challenges by moving rapidly and decisively to reduce costs, minimize working capital and moderate capital expenditures while prioritizing liquidity and maximizing free cash flow. These actions to bolster cash generation, coupled with recent market improvements, position us well to maintain the continuity of our dividend through this downturn. \n We continue to look forward and position the company to benefit from opportunities as the global economy rebounds. We're now pleased to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. \nSteve Byrne: When we look at your ethylene production capacity, it looks like you're likely a producer of hydrogen, potentially hundreds of thousands of tons a year, and perhaps some of that gets used in the refinery operation, and our assumption is most of it is burned for fuel value. But I was just wondering if you had a view of whether that's the best use for all of that hydrogen potentially to qualify for a color of hydrogen other than gray, and whether you thought about that. Perhaps reducing the carbon footprint from natural gas combustion is the best use of that, but welcome your thoughts on that. \nBhavesh Patel: Steve, this is Bob. Indeed, we do produce a lot of hydrogen off of our crackers, especially the ethane crackers. We have some integration with the refinery, as you noted. We also sell some crude hydrogen to the industrial gas companies who then refine the hydrogen.  So there's a mix. Some of it is fuel. Some of it is sold to industrial gas companies, and then -- and the balance goes back to our refinery. And we'll look at that over time as we see industrial gas companies finding new uses for hydrogen to see if we can sell more to them and recover. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. \nJeffrey Zekauskas: What's the timing of the TBA plant? I think, originally, you were going to spend about $2.4 billion to build it. How much have you spent? How much more is there to go? And I think, originally, you thought that the returns were a little bit over $400 million of EBITDA. Have you changed your view of the returns? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes, Jeff. So we've essentially delayed the project by 1 year. So originally, our schedule was to complete the project in Q3 of '21 and to commence commissioning. Now we'll complete in Q3 of '22.  We're still updating our capital forecast on that project. So once we have a better number, we'll provide that to the investment community. We're not really prepared to do that today. \n And then to your question about earnings. So indeed, I mean, we've talked about $400 million to $450 million of EBITDA. And so if you consider 2023 as the first full year of operation, we would expect that kind of that mid-cycle margins for PO and for MTBE, then we should be in that range of $400 million to $450 million of EBITDA contribution. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bhavesh Lodaya from BMO Capital Bank. \nBhavesh Lodaya: This is Bhavesh for John. So Bob, as we think about your different businesses, it seems like most of them are prime for a nice snapback in terms of earnings from the 2Q levels. So from what you are seeing this month, where do you expect the fastest recovery in terms of the businesses? And what's the magnitude of earnings recovery we should think about as you think about the near term? \nBhavesh Patel: Sure. So there's a lot there, and I'll give you kind of the puts and takes. So if you think about our O&P business, that was running well kind of through the lockdown period, especially for end uses like packaging and medical. As we sit here today, we're running in the U.S. basically at full rates. In Europe, we're running between 85% and 90% on our O&P assets. And I would expect that should hold through the quarter. \n I&D, we're running between 85% and 90%, depending on the region and the product. Remember that in I&D, our PO goes into more durable good-type applications tied to auto as well. And that recovery, while it's occurring, it's happening at a slower pace. \n Same with fuel demand. It has recovered off the lows, but we're far from where we were at -- in pre-pandemic levels. \n And then with the refinery, our challenge really is twofold. One is demand recovery for gasoline and for jet fuel, still a long way away from where we were before the pandemic set in. And then the light heavy differential is still very, very narrow, which is hugely leveraging for our refinery. So I think we'll be -- continue to see challenges in the Refining segment for sure. \nOperator: Next question is from Alex Yefremov from KeyBanc. \nAleksey Yefremov: Did you see any feedstock limitations at your Middle Eastern joint ventures? And did you see this issue impact the industry overall? \nBhavesh Patel: Alex, not really. We didn't see much impact. If there was, it was marginal for maybe a week or 2, but not sustained. The challenge for our Middle East assets, really in the early part of Q2, was the flatter cost curve and also lower relative prices in China for polyethylene, which both have now moved in the right direction. So we see full availability of feedstock today and much better margins in our Middle East assets. \nOperator: Next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citigroup. \nP.J. Juvekar: So the question on Slide 12, which is quite helpful when you show the regional production costs, you show that ethane advantage sort of returning back from April to June time period. But on the same slide, the delta between the low cost and the high cost has come down, especially if you compare that back to 2019 levels on that chart. What does that mean to you? I mean does that mean that the profit available for the low-cost player are less than what they were before? Can you just interpret that slide for us in terms of sort of the slope? \nBhavesh Patel: Sure. So certainly, the slope is not as great as it was 2 or 3 years ago. But we still think there's enough advantage. And I think today, P.J., margins are really more driven by the dynamics in China. And what we're seeing today is that polyethylene demand is quite strong. In fact, there's very significant year-over-year growth when we look at -- through Q2 for China polyethylene. And prices have responded quite a lot. \n So I think probably that will be a bigger driver of global polyethylene prices in the near term, is the continued robust demand growth in China. And until oil price moves up further, likely, we have a cost curve that's similar to what it is today. \nDavid Kinney: Yes. And P.J., this is Dave. I think what catches your eye on that chart is the MTO coming down sharply with lower methanol prices here in July. And as you know, that's a relatively small portion of global ethylene supply. So not as impactful as it might look on that chart. \nOperator: Next question is from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. \nVincent Andrews: Bob, could you give us your view on ethane prices sort of what's happened over the last quarter in terms of the increase and the widening of frac spreads and what you think is going to happen in the back half of the year with ethane exports and maybe propane exports and how the U.S. NGL feedstock price perspective could be in the second half? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. Vincent, so on ethane, we had a run-up in price about midway through the quarter. And I think part of that was related to certain producing basins, either shutting in and others restarting, so that it was an effect of the timing of when certain basins were rejecting and certain were in recovery mode. \n I think as we look at the outlook, it's reasonable to assume that ethane prices will remain kind of in the range where they are today. There's already some talk about some of the drilled but uncompleted wells coming back online in the Permian. And so that could boost supply of ethane. Today, there's still 500,000 barrels a day of rejection of ethane. So we think there's enough ethane available. It's more about local sort of dislocations that have impacted the price. \n In terms of propane, propane exports have been fairly strong. There's a lot of propane in the world today. So it seems to me that given more modest demand for propane globally, given kind of the economic situation we find ourselves in, I don't think propane can rise a lot relative to ethane. So we think probably kind of where we are today in terms of feedstocks is the right way to think about it going into -- even into Q4. \nOperator: Next question is from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. \nKevin McCarthy: Bob, as ethylene chain margins have compressed, what impacts do you anticipate on the new supply of ethylene in coming years? Perhaps you could comment on what you see happening with new projects in the U.S., China and elsewhere and also in terms of existing high-cost assets like MTO and some of the higher-cost naphtha-based production in Asia and Europe? \nBhavesh Patel: Sure. So coming back to one of the prior questions about the cost curve, I think that if we look at IHS or others who forecast oil price, it seems that the recovery will take some time to get back to the kind of cost curve that we had back in '16 or '17 even. And so likely, with less slope on the cost curve, there will be less investment. We've already seen some delays in the U.S. that have been announced of new projects. I would expect that, that would continue. \n In China, our working assumption is that largely what's been announced will get built. Now there could be a little bit of delay, but I think it's fair to assume that what's on the books will come online. \n Elsewhere in the world, though, whether it's the Middle East or it's U.S., I would expect very modest, if any, expansion, given the outlook for especially advantaged feedstocks. \n And then with MTO, as Dave mentioned earlier, it represents a very small percentage of global capacity, and it always tends to be the swing. When it's in the money, it will run; when it's not, it will shut down. \nOperator: Next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche. \nDavid Begleiter: Bob, some of the recent U.S. polyethylene price strains has been due to strong U.S. exports. But we are going to see about 3 to 4 ethylene crackers, including yours, come on stream in the back half of the year. Do you think that could weaken U.S. exports and then weaken U.S. polyethylene pricing as a result? \nBhavesh Patel: Well, David, I think that given that where inventories are in Asia today, they're at -- in China. China port inventory is at 5-year lows, and U.S. exports are at maximum today. Very high level of imports from other parts as well into China. I don't think these couple of 3 crackers will really kind of disturb the environment that we find ourselves in. As I mentioned earlier, growth has resumed in China. We're finding that growth rates are in the 4% to 6% range on polyethylene year-over-year. So -- and still recovery in front of us because even in China, there are hotspots in terms of the virus. So I'm pretty constructive about the outlook through Q3. \nOperator: Next question is from Hassan Ahmed, Alembic Global Advisors. \nHassan Ahmed: Bob, a question around the I&D segment. Obviously, historically, it was one of those segments which quarter after quarter, showed pretty stable margins. And obviously, things have changed over, call it, the last 2 quarters. My question is, as I take a look at the volumes by product within that segment, the styrene side of things, the asset use side of things continues to be stable. But obviously, PO/TBA and the like have seen significant sort of corrections, right? So now the question is that, is this primarily because of the unique nature of this downtake, i.e. it's obviously the auto industry that's gotten hit fairly hard. And as we are seeing signs of recovery in that industry, should we expect a snapback in these products? And should we expect a reversal or -- to those sort of stable margin levels? And how quickly should we expect to see that? \nBhavesh Patel: Sure, Hassan. Absolutely. We've always thought of our I&D segment as being one of the more stable segments in the company. And I think it will resume that profile post the virus and after we have vaccines. \n We've not had a period where both U.S. and European auto manufacturers were completely shut down. So we have no kind of historical reference for that. And now we are seeing demand come back in the auto sector, but it's not back to where it was. \n And then for the TBA, the fuels demand has been hit very hard because of the lockdowns. Again, something that we don't have any historical context for. So both, I think, will correct post pandemic, if you will. And I do think that I&D will return to its stable profile that we've come to like about that business. \n Now timing for that, I do think that it's -- of course, it's tied to development of vaccines and therapeutics and, of course, distribution of that. So not just when one is discovered, but when they're actually distributed and given to people. \n I mean I think the recovery, really, we need to be thinking about second half '21, perhaps even into '22 before we see a full recovery. \nDavid Kinney: Hassan, this is Dave. And I'd just add that even though the vehicle miles traveled has returned to what was in January and February before the pandemic, it's nowhere near than the typical summer driving season. And that's what we really need to get those oxyfuels margins back. We're currently in maybe winter-like oxyfuels margins, and it would be nice to be in a typical summer season. \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. And lastly, oil prices also help on oxyfuel margins. So higher oil is better for oxyfuel as well. \nOperator: Our next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. \nArun Viswanathan: I guess I just wanted to ask about -- get your perspective on polyethylene. I guess maybe -- could you help us understand the market? Maybe the increase in June, what kind of led to success there? And I guess, how are you thinking about July and maybe the persistence and holding on to some of this price that we've gotten recently, do you think that's possible? Or do you think maybe that it was mainly the export market kind of improving that drove the price? And so if there's weakening there, maybe we don't see it, or if there's increased supply, maybe we don't see it. So maybe just get your thoughts on polyethylene. \nBhavesh Patel: Sure. So the June increase really was underpinned with lower inventories and the return of exports. So we really, as an industry, ramped up exports in May, June. And I think that continues.  So let me give you some context on inventories. \n Today, the industry inventories, as reported, are somewhere between 3 and 5 days below previous kind of median values. So very low inventories. I think that the $0.04, of course, is in. $0.05, we think, it looks very firm. Operating rates are very high across the industry. That also helps to support the increase. \n And then the next $0.05, beyond the $0.04 and the $0.05 that are already kind of implemented, we think given kind of the backdrop and the improvement in demand, and as I mentioned, strong exports, we think that, that $0.05 also has pretty good chance of going through. And by the way, the $0.04 and the $0.05 that have been implemented, most of the realization will be in Q3 for those increases given kind of how the market works. \nOperator: Next question is from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. \nFrank Mitsch: Congratulations on the Responsible Care Company of the Year. \nBhavesh Patel: Thank you. \nFrank Mitsch: I wanted to follow up on the cash generation. You obviously had a nice quarter in the second quarter, and you've been taking steps to build up a nice cash hoard here. So it kind of begs a question of uses of cash. You had also established a nice track record of raising the dividend. And obviously, Lyondell has been known historically for buying back stock. I was wondering what your latest thoughts on potentially dividend hikes and/or buying back stocks. When might you be in a position given your outlook? And given the success of the $0.05 that you just talked about, might we see some action on that front? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes, Frank. Thank you. So let me first more broadly answer that question by talking about our capital allocation priorities. So our priorities are very simple. It's investment-grade rating through the cycle and continuity of the dividend through the cycle. So those are the 2 most important things that we're solving for as we kind of run the company through this unusual period. \n So in terms of dividend, I think, Frank, given the uncertain outlook, too early to really say whether we would do something to increase the dividend or not. Our priority is about continuity of the $4.20 that we paid today. \n Buybacks. Again, same thing. There's quite a bit of uncertainty until there's a vaccine available and disseminated around the world. So we're going to be somewhat conservative when it comes to increasing dividend or buybacks, just given the uncertain outlook and to make sure that we deliver on the 2 priorities that I mentioned. So that's kind of how I think about uses of cash. \nOperator: The next question is from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. \nDuffy Fischer: Just a question on the China JV, so as it's ramping up now. First one is just the map the contract you have with your partner, how is that going to get priced? And then as it ramps up, how should we think about that impacting your results? How long will it take for it to start kind of dividend-ing to you guys? And then do you have any offtake that would actually impact your sales number? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So Duffy, on the naphtha pricing itself, you should assume it's plus or minus at market essentially for Northeast Asia. And in terms of earnings impact, really minimal earnings this year because we're going to be in the commissioning stage. And just given our experience with our Hyperzone plant that we've been  ramping up rates on, we shouldn't expect earnings from Bora for the remainder of the year. But the commissioning is underway at that JV. \nOperator: The next question is from John Roberts with UBS. \nJohn Roberts: Similar question. Are you exporting any polyolefins to Bora to help them seed the market in advance of the start-up? And did the improvement in the Technology segment also include Bora? \nBhavesh Patel: So Technology segment did not include any benefits from Bora because they've essentially -- they've paid us on our licensing progress payments a while ago. \n And then in terms of premarketing, as you know, we market polyethylene and polypropylene in Asia today. So we have a decent view of how we can place the additional volume. And so we didn't need to send more volume for seeding the market. We've been exporting to Asia, just a matter of normal course. \nOperator: Next question is from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. \nMichael Sison: For OP Americas, your EBITDA margin was in the mid-teens. I would imagine it was a lot better in June. Any help in understanding how much better it was? And as you think about you running your plants, I think you said at near 100 -- or nameplate, whatever, in July, how much better should EBITDA margins improve in third quarter versus second quarter? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. Mike, I think you can look at IHS-posted price change, if you will, on polyethylene. That will be a guide. \n Now the $0.04, some of that tends to be realized in July as well. So not all of the $0.04 will be realized in June. And same with the next $0.05 that's being implemented now. It kind of goes across 2 months. \n Probably the biggest improvement in margin that we're seeing is from the C4 market improving somewhat. It's coming off bottom. It's not great, to be frank, but it's better than what it was back in  March, April. So a combination of stabilizing ethane price, better C4 and higher polyethylene as we realize these increases as kind of the drivers for polyethylene margin. \nOperator: Next question is from Jonas Oxgaard with Bernstein. \nJonas Oxgaard: Just wanted to ask about like after the pandemic is all over. We've seen increased demand from packaging, decreased  trend from industrial so far and decreased recycling. But as we're looking, say, 6 months from now, how do you see this sort of squaring out? Is this packaging demand permanent? Can we actually see a sustained boost? And what about the other pieces? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So Jonas, I think some of the packaging demand will be more permanent. And as you've probably noted, some of the single-use plastic bans have been reversed because of the benefits of -- in terms of hygiene of single-use bags and so on. So I think there will be some lasting benefit, but I wouldn't bank all of it in packaging. There will be some improvement. \n Then as for the other segments like auto and so on, I mean, we would expect there to be a rapid recovery once a vaccine is developed and we're clearly behind -- the pandemic is behind us. So I think net-net, probably positive for packaging and medical. \nOperator: The last question in the queue is from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. \nMatthew Blair: So your Refining results came in better than our expectations. I was hoping you could quantify the hedge benefit in Q2 and just talk about whether that might reverse in Q3, just given higher crude prices. And then also, could you talk about what's allowing you to run the refinery at levels so much higher than the U.S.? I think in Q2, you were at 88% utilization. U.S. is closer to 72%. So I guess, is that a function of like any Middle Eastern barrels or any sort of wider crude discounts rolling through? \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So I'm going to ask Michael to answer the first question on the results. \nMichael McMurray: Matthew, so it's Michael. Yes, so earlier in the year, we locked in a favorable Maya-Brent differential, hedged out roughly kind of 10% to 15% of our volumes from April through December. At the end of the quarter, had a positive mark of about $3 to $4. That was -- we did not achieve hedge accounting, so that was all in the quarter itself. So that should kind of give you a little bit of color. We would not expect that to kind of recur in the third and fourth quarter, obviously, because we marked it in the second quarter. \nBhavesh Patel: Yes. And then in terms of the crude run rates, Matthew, it's more about the configuration of our refinery and the fact that we don't make as much jet or gasoline because we're a heavy crude processing refinery. So for us, it was more about finding incremental barrels to get from 85% to 90% that had positive contribution margin. But I think the heavy processing setup of our refinery probably favored us incrementally. \nOperator: And that was the final question in the queue. \nBhavesh Patel: Okay. Thank you. Well, let me offer a few closing remarks. Our consistent focus on cash generation and disciplined capital allocation will help us steer through any point in the cycle. We're really well equipped for the current challenges. We've leveraged our leading portfolio, our advantaged positions toward our goal of delivering sustainable value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call in October. Thank you. And with that, we're adjourned. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bhavesh Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and good day to all of you participating around the world. I hope that you, your colleagues and your families are all staying healthy during these challenging times. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. \n Let's begin with Slide 3 and review the highlights. LyondellBasell's employees leveraged our core strengths in operational excellence, cost management and commercial agility to generate $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities during an extremely challenging quarter. This represents an improvement of over $100 million relative to the second quarter of 2019 despite our significantly lower earnings. \n During the second quarter, our team rapidly responded to weakening market conditions by aggressively reducing inventory to match lower levels of demand that reduced cash working capital by $575 million. We developed plans to reduce CapEx by approximately $500 million during the year. This includes slowing down of our PO/TBA project. We also made significant progress on cost-reduction efforts towards our goal of a run rate of $150 million to $200 million in recurring annual savings by the end of this year. \n We have quickly adapted to changing conditions in our markets, workplaces and communities to ensure that our assets continue to operate safely and serve the dynamic needs of our customers. LyondellBasell's products support many of society's critical needs such as melt-blown fibers for N95 face masks, alcohols for sanitizers and packaging that prevents the contamination and spoilage of our food I'm very thankful for the innovative thinking, tireless dedication and disciplined approach to health and safety exhibited by our employees around the world to ensure that we continue to serve our customers and protect our communities during these difficult times. \n Our second quarter EBITDA of nearly $700 million represents a decline of nearly 40% relative to the first quarter and almost 60% relative to the second quarter of last year. These results are reflective of pandemic-driven declines in demand and margins across many of the markets we serve, especially in transportation fuels and products used in automotive manufacturing and other durable goods end markets. \n Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our recent safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to health and safety has become even more relevant to our employees, contractors and communities during the coronavirus pandemic. We leveraged the early experience from our employees in the Asia Pacific region to develop protocols for workplace sanitization, facial covering, social distancing, health screening and contact tracing to minimize the spread of virus across our global facilities. \n Although we have limited influence in our surrounding communities, our processes have proven highly effective in limiting virus spread within our workplaces. Our employees have continued to deliver top-quartile, if not top-decile, safety performance while adopting these additional pandemic-related protocols. \n In June, our company was honored to receive the American Chemistry Council's highest distinction the Responsible Care Company of the Year award. The award recognized our innovative practices and leadership in the areas of environmental, health, safety and security. This honor is a direct reflection of the dedication of our entire LyondellBasell team and their work to ensure that the health and safety of our people and the communities where we operate are always our highest priorities. \n The pandemic has generated a renewed appreciation for the value of our chemical and polymer products for society. At the same time, LyondellBasell has not retreated from our commitment to developing circular and sustainable business models for our products. \n Let's turn to Slide 5, where we highlight our progress on molecular recycling. \n LyondellBasell's mechanical recycling business model is focused on forming partnerships with waste management companies who can clean and sort plastic waste, enabling the production of premium recycled plastics. Nonetheless, we recognize that many plastic products are composed of multiple materials that cannot be easily sorted in the pure waste streams.  Late last year, we announced our initiative to develop a new proprietary technology called MoReTec to convert mixed plastic waste into a feedstock we could use in our existing assets to produce new chemicals and polymers. On Slide 5, you can see we have already scaled up this technology from the laboratory to a pilot plant that we commissioned during July in Ferrara, Italy. Our aim is to advance our catalyzed process technology to an industrial scale that will enable the production of monomer feedstock from waste plastic that is competitive with naphtha-based economics. MoReTec could provide another option for satisfying growing demand for circular plastics produced without fossil-based feedstocks. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial performance. Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 10 and review our second quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of these  LCM inventory changes. \n Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continue to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the second quarter was nearly $700 million. The global response to limit the spread of COVID-19 reduced demand and margins for many of our products. Our Olefin and Polyolefin segments rapidly responded to increased demand for our products used in consumer-driven packaging and health care while reducing production for polymers used in durable goods applications with falling demand. \n Our Intermediates and Derivatives, Refining and Advanced Polymer Solutions segments were impacted by the significant reduction in demand for transportation fuels and polymers utilized in automotive and other durable goods segments. The resiliency of our business portfolio continues to benefit from our relatively high participation in markets with consumer-driven demand for nondurable products and our global market reach. \n Let's review our second quarter results, starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 11. Second quarter EBITDA was $210 million, $267 million lower than the first quarter. The pandemic reduced demand for polyethylene from export markets and polyolefins for durable goods markets, resulting in margin and volume declines. \n Olefins results decreased approximately $230 million compared to the first quarter. Margins declined on lower coal product prices, particularly for butadiene and other C4s. As discussed in our first quarter call, we reduced our ethylene operating rates to about 75% of nameplate capacity for the second quarter to address weaker demand. Ethane made up 60% of our ethylene cracker feed slate during the quarter as weak demand for butadiene and other coal products offset the advantages of cracking low-priced naphtha feedstock. Polyolefins results decreased about $45 million during the second quarter, driven by declines in both margins and volumes. \n We believe the pandemic-driven declines in demand bottomed during the second quarter. We are seeing improvements in pricing and volumes as global economies reopen and demand for polyethylene exports and durable goods returns. We expect to operate our U.S. ethylene crackers at nearly full rates of 95% of nameplate capacity during the third quarter. \n With that, let's turn to Slide 12 and take a look at recent developments in feedstock costs around the world. As illustrated in the chart, during 2019, the cost of ethylene production in both North America and the Middle East remain highly advantaged relative to naphtha-based costs in Europe and the rest of the world. This has been the familiar shape of the global cost curve since U.S. shale oil and gas production came online over the prior decade. \n The small amount of ethylene produced by methanol to olefins technology in China is typically on the high end of the cost curve. In March and April, crude oil prices rapidly fell in response to both reduced fuel demand from the pandemic and increased crude production as Saudi Arabia and Russia sought to pressure higher-cost oil producers. When naphtha-based costs became favored during March and April, some speculated that the curve would have remained inverted, eliminating the U.S. shale gas advantage. \n As economies began reopening during May and June, the cost curve quickly regained slope and reasserted the advantage of Middle East and North American feedstocks. North America has an abundance of ethane and other natural gas liquid resources. While events may occasionally depress oil prices and temporarily invert the cost curve, we continue to believe that North American producers will typically have advantage for the foreseeable future. \n Looking at the polypropylene market on Slide 13. We are seeing indications of increased demand from the automotive market as well as continued strength in packaging orders. Approximately 15% of LyondellBasell's North American polypropylene business serves the automotive market by either providing base resins to our downstream Advanced Polymer Solutions segment or through direct sales to third-party manufacturers of vehicle components. \n In the first half of this year, automotive manufacturers shut down production to limit virus spread and then reopened, first in China, later in Europe, and then the United States. China's progress can be seen by June 2020 new vehicle tire demand that is 11% higher than the same month last year. In Europe and the U.S., June 2020 new vehicle production remains down by 31% and 26%, respectively, relative to pre-COVID forecasts. \n The progress in North American automotive demand for polypropylene can be seen in the chart on the right that tracks our order books for these applications. Demand has risen sharply during June and July as automotive manufacturers resumed production. In addition, LyondellBasell's polypropylene orders for consumer-driven packaging applications have remained at the elevated levels we have seen through the pandemic with 20% higher demand from packaging markets during the first half of the year. \n Now please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. During the second quarter, EBITDA was $219 million, $6 million lower than the first quarter. Despite reduced demand as a result of the pandemic, integrated profit margins remained relatively stable.  Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million driven by a decrease in both margin and volume. Ethylene margin decreased as reductions in ethylene and pulp product prices outpaced declining feedstock costs. Volume decreased following strong production in the prior quarter, coupled with lower demand in the second quarter. Our European crackers operated at 84% of capacity during the quarter. \n Combined polyolefin results increased more than $20 million compared to the prior quarter. Margins improved and were partially offset by a decrease in polypropylene volumes due to reduced demand from automotive and other durable goods markets. \n Higher margins in our joint ventures contributed to an increase in equity income of approximately $55 million. Increased demand for melt-blown polypropylene used in N95 face masks and other medical applications drove improved demand and margins for our PolyMirae joint venture in South Korea. \n In the coming quarter, we expect margins to decrease due to higher feedstock costs. We expect that our European crackers will operate at about 90% of nameplate capacity during the third quarter as some of our competitors in the region are expected to be down for planned maintenance. \n Please turn to Slide 15 for an update of our new Chinese integrated cracker joint venture with Bora. Over the past few weeks, the construction team handed off the project to the operations team for commissioning during August. Although most of the ethylene feedstock will be naphtha supplied by our partner's adjacent refinery, the cracker also has flexibility to utilize LPG feedstocks from global sources, and this slide shows the first delivery of an LPG cargo to the cracker a few weeks ago in preparation for our start-up. Our equity contribution to the joint venture is expected to occur during the third quarter. This joint venture investment allows LyondellBasell to rapidly expand in the world's fastest-growing market for our products. \n Please turn to Slide 16. Let's take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $121 million, $160 million lower than the prior quarter. As we expected, second quarter results reflect a significant reduction in gasoline and other durable goods demand that impacted both margins and volume for oxyfuels and related products as well as propylene oxide and derivative volumes. Second quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results decreased approximately $55 million due to lower volumes from reduced demand for polyurethanes in automotive, construction and furniture markets. \n Intermediate chemicals results were relatively flat. Oxyfuels and related products results decreased approximately $95 million as a result of lower margins and lower volumes. Margins were compressed by lower gasoline prices. Volumes declined due to lower demand for automotive fuels and isobutylene. \n We anticipate that demand for transportation fuels will improve in the third quarter. Profitability for our oxyfuels and related products business is expected to follow but not to the typical high levels we normally realize during the summer driving season. \n With that, let's turn to Slide 17 and look at some positive indicators in the demand for transportation fuels. In the U.S., stay-at-home closures largely occurred over the months of March and April, with the reopenings beginning in May. This can be seen in the chart as vehicle miles traveled bottomed during April. Summer driving and reopening increased vehicle mileage for June to be about 95% of what it was in February. In addition, increased consumption is reducing gasoline inventories, allowing for a gradual improvement in refinery operating rates. While we may need to moderate reopening progress to control virus spread, the trends support improving supply and demand balances for transportation fuels that should be constructive for profitability going forward. \n Now let's move on and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA was $23 million, $92 million lower than the first quarter. Volumes declined significantly as a result of pandemic-related shutdowns at automotive manufacturers. We temporarily idled production at several of our small compounding plants in the APS segment to respond to reduced demand. \n Second quarter pretax integration costs were $16 million. Compounding and solutions results decreased approximately $75 million due to lower volumes driven by decreased demand for polymer compounds from the automotive sector. Advanced Polymers results decreased about $10 million due to lower demand in the construction and automotive end markets. \n Automotive manufacturers partially resumed production at their facilities in the latter part of the second quarter. As a result, we expect third quarter profitability for the segment to benefit from returning demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end markets. \n During July, we restarted most of our idle plants, and we plan to operate our compounding capacity at rates that match downstream automotive demand. \n Now let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was negative $14 million, a $66 million improvement versus the first quarter of 2020. Results were pressured by a significant reduction in transportation fuel demand as the U.S. implemented measures to reduce the spread of the virus. In the second quarter, margins improved as prices of coke and sulfur co-products from our refinery held up relative to the falling prices of crude oil. We also benefited from mark-to-market gains from a hedge on a portion of our crude oil purchases. These improvements were partially offset by a decrease in the Maya 2-1-1 industry benchmark frac spread to an average of $13.27 per barrel. \n Average crude throughput increased by 11,000 barrels per day to 237,000 barrels per day with the resumption of operations at our fluidized catalytic factory unit during April. We anticipate that reduced demand for gasoline and jet fuel will continue to pressure our Refining margins until demand approaches pre-COVID levels. We are planning to operate the refinery at 85% to 90% of nameplate crude throughput during the third quarter. \n Please turn to Slide 20 as we review the results of our Technology segment. During the second quarter, Technology segment EBITDA was $112 million, an increase of $56 million compared to the prior quarter. Licensing revenues increased -- catalyst volumes also increased as customers stopped inventories early in the pandemic. Our Technology segment licenses polymer production technologies for new manufacturing plants that enable subsequent catalyst sales to licensing customers over the lifetime of the asset. \n Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones results in an uneven pace for licensing revenues. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming milestones, we expect that third quarter licensing profitability will be comparable to the same quarter last year. \n Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook on Slide 21. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged global positions continued to deliver resilient results during a challenging market environment. We demonstrated commercial agility by pivoting production towards increased demand from packaging and health care markets while aggressively managing inventories for products affected by shutdowns in the automotive and other durable goods manufacturing. Our foundations in leveraging low operating costs and optimal asset utilization serves us well during any point in the cycle. \n Our capital deployment strategy continues to provide support for our dividend through efficient cash generation and disciplined allocation of capital expenditures for required maintenance and selective profit-generating growth. All capital deployment decisions remain grounded in our commitment to an investment-grade credit rating. \n We believe the pandemic-driven decline in demand bottomed during the second quarter. Demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually rebound as global economies continue to reopen. Markets for discretionary durable goods are improving but will likely take longer to recover from the downturn. We expect that strong consumer-driven demand for our products in packaging and medical applications will continue over the near to medium term. LyondellBasell is addressing these challenges by moving rapidly and decisively to reduce costs, minimize working capital and moderate capital expenditures while prioritizing liquidity and maximizing free cash flow. These actions to bolster cash generation, coupled with recent market improvements, position us well to maintain the continuity of our dividend through this downturn. \n We continue to look forward and position the company to benefit from opportunities as the global economy rebounds. We're now pleased to take your questions. Steve, this is Bob. Indeed, we do produce a lot of hydrogen off of our crackers, especially the ethane crackers. We have some integration with the refinery, as you noted. We also sell some crude hydrogen to the industrial gas companies who then refine the hydrogen.  So there's a mix. Some of it is fuel. Some of it is sold to industrial gas companies, and then -- and the balance goes back to our refinery. And we'll look at that over time as we see industrial gas companies finding new uses for hydrogen to see if we can sell more to them and recover. Yes, Jeff. So we've essentially delayed the project by 1 year. So originally, our schedule was to complete the project in Q3 of '21 and to commence commissioning. Now we'll complete in Q3 of '22.  We're still updating our capital forecast on that project. So once we have a better number, we'll provide that to the investment community. We're not really prepared to do that today. \n And then to your question about earnings. So indeed, I mean, we've talked about $400 million to $450 million of EBITDA. And so if you consider 2023 as the first full year of operation, we would expect that kind of that mid-cycle margins for PO and for MTBE, then we should be in that range of $400 million to $450 million of EBITDA contribution. Sure. So there's a lot there, and I'll give you kind of the puts and takes. So if you think about our O&P business, that was running well kind of through the lockdown period, especially for end uses like packaging and medical. As we sit here today, we're running in the U.S. basically at full rates. In Europe, we're running between 85% and 90% on our O&P assets. And I would expect that should hold through the quarter. \n I&D, we're running between 85% and 90%, depending on the region and the product. Remember that in I&D, our PO goes into more durable good-type applications tied to auto as well. And that recovery, while it's occurring, it's happening at a slower pace. \n Same with fuel demand. It has recovered off the lows, but we're far from where we were at -- in pre-pandemic levels. \n And then with the refinery, our challenge really is twofold. One is demand recovery for gasoline and for jet fuel, still a long way away from where we were before the pandemic set in. And then the light heavy differential is still very, very narrow, which is hugely leveraging for our refinery. So I think we'll be -- continue to see challenges in the Refining segment for sure. Alex, not really. We didn't see much impact. If there was, it was marginal for maybe a week or 2, but not sustained. The challenge for our Middle East assets, really in the early part of Q2, was the flatter cost curve and also lower relative prices in China for polyethylene, which both have now moved in the right direction. So we see full availability of feedstock today and much better margins in our Middle East assets. Sure. So certainly, the slope is not as great as it was 2 or 3 years ago. But we still think there's enough advantage. And I think today, P.J., margins are really more driven by the dynamics in China. And what we're seeing today is that polyethylene demand is quite strong. In fact, there's very significant year-over-year growth when we look at -- through Q2 for China polyethylene. And prices have responded quite a lot. \n So I think probably that will be a bigger driver of global polyethylene prices in the near term, is the continued robust demand growth in China. And until oil price moves up further, likely, we have a cost curve that's similar to what it is today. Yes. Vincent, so on ethane, we had a run-up in price about midway through the quarter. And I think part of that was related to certain producing basins, either shutting in and others restarting, so that it was an effect of the timing of when certain basins were rejecting and certain were in recovery mode. \n I think as we look at the outlook, it's reasonable to assume that ethane prices will remain kind of in the range where they are today. There's already some talk about some of the drilled but uncompleted wells coming back online in the Permian. And so that could boost supply of ethane. Today, there's still 500,000 barrels a day of rejection of ethane. So we think there's enough ethane available. It's more about local sort of dislocations that have impacted the price. \n In terms of propane, propane exports have been fairly strong. There's a lot of propane in the world today. So it seems to me that given more modest demand for propane globally, given kind of the economic situation we find ourselves in, I don't think propane can rise a lot relative to ethane. So we think probably kind of where we are today in terms of feedstocks is the right way to think about it going into -- even into Q4. Sure. So coming back to one of the prior questions about the cost curve, I think that if we look at IHS or others who forecast oil price, it seems that the recovery will take some time to get back to the kind of cost curve that we had back in '16 or '17 even. And so likely, with less slope on the cost curve, there will be less investment. We've already seen some delays in the U.S. that have been announced of new projects. I would expect that, that would continue. \n In China, our working assumption is that largely what's been announced will get built. Now there could be a little bit of delay, but I think it's fair to assume that what's on the books will come online. \n Elsewhere in the world, though, whether it's the Middle East or it's U.S., I would expect very modest, if any, expansion, given the outlook for especially advantaged feedstocks. \n And then with MTO, as Dave mentioned earlier, it represents a very small percentage of global capacity, and it always tends to be the swing. When it's in the money, it will run; when it's not, it will shut down. Well, David, I think that given that where inventories are in Asia today, they're at -- in China. China port inventory is at 5-year lows, and U.S. exports are at maximum today. Very high level of imports from other parts as well into China. I don't think these couple of 3 crackers will really kind of disturb the environment that we find ourselves in. As I mentioned earlier, growth has resumed in China. We're finding that growth rates are in the 4% to 6% range on polyethylene year-over-year. So -- and still recovery in front of us because even in China, there are hotspots in terms of the virus. So I'm pretty constructive about the outlook through Q3. Sure, Hassan. Absolutely. We've always thought of our I&D segment as being one of the more stable segments in the company. And I think it will resume that profile post the virus and after we have vaccines. \n We've not had a period where both U.S. and European auto manufacturers were completely shut down. So we have no kind of historical reference for that. And now we are seeing demand come back in the auto sector, but it's not back to where it was. \n And then for the TBA, the fuels demand has been hit very hard because of the lockdowns. Again, something that we don't have any historical context for. So both, I think, will correct post pandemic, if you will. And I do think that I&D will return to its stable profile that we've come to like about that business. \n Now timing for that, I do think that it's -- of course, it's tied to development of vaccines and therapeutics and, of course, distribution of that. So not just when one is discovered, but when they're actually distributed and given to people. \n I mean I think the recovery, really, we need to be thinking about second half '21, perhaps even into '22 before we see a full recovery. Yes. And lastly, oil prices also help on oxyfuel margins. So higher oil is better for oxyfuel as well. Sure. So the June increase really was underpinned with lower inventories and the return of exports. So we really, as an industry, ramped up exports in May, June. And I think that continues.  So let me give you some context on inventories. \n Today, the industry inventories, as reported, are somewhere between 3 and 5 days below previous kind of median values. So very low inventories. I think that the $0.04, of course, is in. $0.05, we think, it looks very firm. Operating rates are very high across the industry. That also helps to support the increase. \n And then the next $0.05, beyond the $0.04 and the $0.05 that are already kind of implemented, we think given kind of the backdrop and the improvement in demand, and as I mentioned, strong exports, we think that, that $0.05 also has pretty good chance of going through. And by the way, the $0.04 and the $0.05 that have been implemented, most of the realization will be in Q3 for those increases given kind of how the market works. Thank you. Yes, Frank. Thank you. So let me first more broadly answer that question by talking about our capital allocation priorities. So our priorities are very simple. It's investment-grade rating through the cycle and continuity of the dividend through the cycle. So those are the 2 most important things that we're solving for as we kind of run the company through this unusual period. \n So in terms of dividend, I think, Frank, given the uncertain outlook, too early to really say whether we would do something to increase the dividend or not. Our priority is about continuity of the $4.20 that we paid today. \n Buybacks. Again, same thing. There's quite a bit of uncertainty until there's a vaccine available and disseminated around the world. So we're going to be somewhat conservative when it comes to increasing dividend or buybacks, just given the uncertain outlook and to make sure that we deliver on the 2 priorities that I mentioned. So that's kind of how I think about uses of cash. Yes. So Duffy, on the naphtha pricing itself, you should assume it's plus or minus at market essentially for Northeast Asia. And in terms of earnings impact, really minimal earnings this year because we're going to be in the commissioning stage. And just given our experience with our Hyperzone plant that we've been  ramping up rates on, we shouldn't expect earnings from Bora for the remainder of the year. But the commissioning is underway at that JV. So Technology segment did not include any benefits from Bora because they've essentially -- they've paid us on our licensing progress payments a while ago. \n And then in terms of premarketing, as you know, we market polyethylene and polypropylene in Asia today. So we have a decent view of how we can place the additional volume. And so we didn't need to send more volume for seeding the market. We've been exporting to Asia, just a matter of normal course. Yes. Mike, I think you can look at IHS-posted price change, if you will, on polyethylene. That will be a guide. \n Now the $0.04, some of that tends to be realized in July as well. So not all of the $0.04 will be realized in June. And same with the next $0.05 that's being implemented now. It kind of goes across 2 months. \n Probably the biggest improvement in margin that we're seeing is from the C4 market improving somewhat. It's coming off bottom. It's not great, to be frank, but it's better than what it was back in  March, April. So a combination of stabilizing ethane price, better C4 and higher polyethylene as we realize these increases as kind of the drivers for polyethylene margin. Yes. So Jonas, I think some of the packaging demand will be more permanent. And as you've probably noted, some of the single-use plastic bans have been reversed because of the benefits of -- in terms of hygiene of single-use bags and so on. So I think there will be some lasting benefit, but I wouldn't bank all of it in packaging. There will be some improvement. \n Then as for the other segments like auto and so on, I mean, we would expect there to be a rapid recovery once a vaccine is developed and we're clearly behind -- the pandemic is behind us. So I think net-net, probably positive for packaging and medical. Yes. So I'm going to ask Michael to answer the first question on the results. Yes. And then in terms of the crude run rates, Matthew, it's more about the configuration of our refinery and the fact that we don't make as much jet or gasoline because we're a heavy crude processing refinery. So for us, it was more about finding incremental barrels to get from 85% to 90% that had positive contribution margin. But I think the heavy processing setup of our refinery probably favored us incrementally. Okay. Thank you. Well, let me offer a few closing remarks. Our consistent focus on cash generation and disciplined capital allocation will help us steer through any point in the cycle. We're really well equipped for the current challenges. We've leveraged our leading portfolio, our advantaged positions toward our goal of delivering sustainable value for our shareholders. We look forward to updating you on our next earnings call in October. Thank you. And with that, we're adjourned."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, our company continued to generate substantial cash during the second quarter. \n Slide 6 illustrates our cash flow performance over the past 5 years. During this time, we have consistently generated $5 billion to $6 billion of cash from operating activities on an annual basis. Over the last 12 months, more than 110% of our EBITDA was converted into cash from operating activities. With approximately $1.1 billion of capital expenditures dedicated to maintaining our assets and $5 billion in cash from operating activities, our free operating cash flow yield remained strong at 17.6%. Our team is aggressively managing inventories through dynamic markets while prioritizing cash generation and liquidity. \n Now please turn to Slide 7, where we provide further details on cash generation during the second quarter. You can see that our businesses generated $1.3 billion cash from operating activities, up more than $100 million from 1 year ago, despite our significantly lower earnings. During the second quarter, we increased our cash on hand to $3.2 billion with a $2 billion bond issuance in April at very attractive rates. Capital expenditures of $588 million declined more than 10% compared to the first quarter as we began to slow activities on the PO/TBA plant construction. \n In the second quarter, we paid $350 million in dividends to our shareholders. We ended the quarter with about $5.8 billion of cash and available liquidity. With strong cash generation and ample liquidity, we remain confident in our ability to fund our dividend, primarily from operating cash flows. \n As announced during the prior quarter, we rapidly developed strategies to respond to a variety of economic scenarios. Slide 8 illustrates our actions to reduce capital expenditures in 2020 by approximately $500 million. In addition to slowing the PO/TBA activities, we have also deferred planned maintenance during the pandemic. You may recall from our Investor Day last September that our plan was to reduce capital expenditures to $1.9 billion by 2022. We are accelerating this program and now plan to achieve this target 2 years ahead of schedule. \n Let's continue to Slide 9 and summarize the impact of these initiatives. The combination of lower capital expenditures, reduced discretionary spending and cash released from working capital is expected to improve our 2020 free cash flow by as much as $1.1 billion. We are also pursuing further optimization of our low-cost structure by accelerating cost-efficiency initiatives. With our disciplined approach to capital deployment and about $5.8 billion in cash and available liquidity, we believe the company is well positioned for this dynamic market environment. \n Before I turn the call over to Bob, allow me to provide an update on the annual financial modeling guidance that we discussed last quarter. We now expect that our 2020 effective tax rate will be lower than our previous guidance of a mid-teens percentage rate. The lower effective rate is related to both reduced profitability and favorable impacts from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security, or CARES Act. The net impact of the CARES Act on the company for the full year is expected to be favorable. The 2020 cash tax rate is expected to remain in line with our previously committed estimate of a mid- to high-teens percentage rate. \n With that, I'll turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob? Matthew, so it's Michael. Yes, so earlier in the year, we locked in a favorable Maya-Brent differential, hedged out roughly kind of 10% to 15% of our volumes from April through December. At the end of the quarter, had a positive mark of about $3 to $4. That was -- we did not achieve hedge accounting, so that was all in the quarter itself. So that should kind of give you a little bit of color. We would not expect that to kind of recur in the third and fourth quarter, obviously, because we marked it in the second quarter."

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell's First Quarter 2020 Teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings which are available at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with other disclosures including the earnings release are also currently available on our website. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 P.M. Eastern Time today until June 1st by calling 866-397-1431 in the United States and 203-369-0538 outside the United States. The passcode for both numbers is 1160. During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results the current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in first out or LIFO accounting and the recent decline in prices of our raw materials and finished goods inventories. During the first quarter, we recognized pretax LCM charges totaling $419 million. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results excluding the impacts of these LCM inventory charges. With that being said I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Patel: Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you participating around the world. I hope that you, your colleagues, and your families are all staying healthy during these difficult times. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today as we discuss our Q1 results. Let's begin with slide three and review the first quarter highlights. LyondellBasell's business portfolio continued to deliver relatively resilient performance amid challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic, rapidly falling oil prices, and deteriorating economic activity. Our global asset footprint, feedstock flexibility, and disciplined financial strategies are serving us well and enabling us to navigate through these unprecedented market conditions. Our first quarter EBITDA $1.1 billion represents a decline of approximately 12% relative to the fourth quarter and 25% relative to the first quarter of the prior year. Despite robust demand for our polymers used in consumer packaging and medical applications, profitability was impacted by soft demand for our transportation fuels and products used in automotive and other durable goods end markets. Events surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and the drop in oil prices continue to evolve and impact global markets for our products. Let's turn to slide four and review our approach to mitigate the effects from these headwinds. Currently, all of our major manufacturing sites are operating. In response to lower demand for certain products, we temporarily idled production at several small plants in our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment serving automotive end-markets and appropriately decreased production rates and other plans to match reduced end-market demand. Industry consultants estimate that petrochemical and refining assets in various parts of the world are running at 60% to 80% of nameplate capacity. We expect that the majority of LyondellBasell's capacity will also operate within that range during the second quarter. Our manufacturing operations have been declared as an essential industry, supporting society's needs to fight the pandemic in the majority of the regions in which we operate. We implemented best practices recommended by medical professionals and governmental bodies to protect our employees, contractors, assets, and the communities where we operate around the world, while maintaining business continuity with our customers and suppliers. Since the activation of our global pandemic response team in late January, we instituted social distancing practices, escalated our sanitization protocols, and increased employee health monitoring at all of our manufacturing sites. Our office-based employees worked productively from home as the pandemic spread from Asia to Europe then to the Americas. We are implementing processes to enable a safe and full return to workplaces as conditions permit around the world. The majority of our 1,000 employees in China are now back in our plants and offices. I want to thank and acknowledge our over 19,000 LyondellBasell employees for their tireless innovation, dedication, and sense of ownership they have exhibited for our company during these difficult times. Since the full extent of the pandemic, the drop in oil prices and the economic downturn remains uncertain. We are acting on strategies to respond to a range of economic scenarios. Over the past few quarters, we have been working on meaningful cost-saving initiatives across the company. Those initiatives have been accelerated. In response to falling demand, we instituted more aggressive inventory management policies. When combined with lower prices for raw materials and products, we expect these actions will provide a meaningful release of cash from working capital, during 2020. In order to reduce operational and financial risk, we postponed selected growth projects and planned maintenance, including slowing construction activities, on our PO/TBA plant. We currently expect these actions will reduce 2020 capital expenditures by approximately 20%, from our prior guidance of $2.4 billion to our current outlook of $1.9 billion. During April, strong demand for our investment-grade bonds enabled us to increase liquidity by $2 billion, with a successful offering that resulted in the lowest U.S. dollar interest rates in the history of our company. We remain confident that our resilient cash generation and disciplined approach to capital deployment will serve us well during these challenging times. Our focus on funding the dividend, while remaining committed to a strong investment-grade balance sheet, plays an integral role to our shareholder value proposition. We believe that our actions to reduce operating costs, capital expenditures and working capital will generate sufficient free cash flow over the coming quarters. In the event of a prolonged or deeper downturn, we will act pragmatically and evaluate all prudent options. In March, lower oil prices and reduced demand for transportation fuels, negatively impacted both volumes and margins for our Refining segment and our Oxyfuels & Related Products business within the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Global shutdowns by automotive manufacturers, sharply reduced demand for our polypropylene compounds within the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Consumer-driven demand for polyolefins used in packaging and health care products, supported relatively stable integrated polyethylene margins, in the Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. Lower feedstock prices resulted in higher integrated polyethylene margins for our O&P \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. While we expect that demand for durable goods will take some time to recover lasting changes in consumer lifestyles may have beneficial mid-term implications for some of our large end-use markets. On slide 5, we show some recent North American market research that suggests changes in consumer buying habits that could endure beyond the current crisis. As you may have experienced consumer stockpiled home pantries as it became clear that societal restrictions were required to slow the spread of the virus. LyondellBasell felt this surge for our polymers used in consumer packaging to safely deliver food, medicines and other essential products to households around the world. The need for plastic packaging increased as society moved from bulk volumes used in workplaces and restaurants, towards smaller package sizes delivered and consumed in the home. Excessive demand for paper goods has subsided. And thankfully most stockpiles of home health care products do not require replenishment. But lifestyle changes are creating a new normal as consumer-based demand for frozen, dairy and packaged food has risen by approximately 30%. Surveys indicate that after staying at home during the pandemic, 40% of Americans plan to increase the amount of time they work from home and 65% intend to eat at home, more often. These changes are likely to increase demand for the polyolefin packaging that is typically used in these applications. Let's turn to slide 6 and review our recent safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to health and safety has become even more relevant to our employees, contractors and communities, during the pandemic. Our employees have continued to deliver top quartile, if not top decile safety performance, despite numerous potential distractions through these difficult times. Earlier, I mentioned our precautionary measures to increase the frequency and intensity of our workplace, sanitization, social distancing practices, health monitoring and self-reporting processes, to reduce the spread of the virus among our workforce. Our processes have proven effective, with limited virus spread across our global employee population. LyondellBasell's manufacturing operations have been designated as an essential industry to support society's needs during the pandemic. Let's turn to slide 7, where we highlight LyondellBasell's role in supplying vital products that support health care, hygiene and medical needs. For example, our polypropylene resins are used by customers to produce melt-blown fibers that provide filtration in face masks. Our masterbatch products are used to produce breathable films. Our polyethylene is used for protective clothing, draping and medical packaging. And our polypropylene, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are used to make syringes, tubing, test kits, soaps, disinfectants, medical devices and many other products. With that I will turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial performance.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 illustrates our relatively consistent cash flow performance over the past five years. Over the last 12 months, 90% of our EBITDA translated into cash from operating activities. With approximately $1 billion dedicated to maintaining our assets, our free operating cash flow remained relatively healthy at $3.8 billion. As you heard from Bob, we are putting a significant amount of focus on cash generation and liquidity. Now please turn to Slide 9, where we provide further details on cash generation for the first quarter. You can see that our business has generated $500 million of cash from operating activities during the first quarter, down just over $100 million from one year ago. During the first quarter, we increased our cash on hand to $1.8 billion in an abundance of caution with borrowings from our revolving credit, accounts receivable and commercial paper facilities. Capital expenditures were approximately $660 million, as we continue to move forward on our PO/TBA plant. In the first quarter, we paid $351 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Bob mentioned, we have developed strategies to respond to a variety of economic scenarios. Slide 10 outlines the actions we have taken to maximize liquidity. We are increasing cash inflows by accelerating cost-saving initiatives and reducing working capital. At the end of March we had $3.2 billion in liquidity. We further bolstered this liquidity through the successful issuance of $2 billion in senior notes in April at very attractive long-term rates. With the slowdown of our PO/TBA plant construction, postponement of growth projects and some deferral of planned maintenance will reduce our 2020 capital expenditures by $500 million relative to our prior guidance. In the current uncertain environment, we will prioritize liquidity over share repurchases and any potential M&A activities. We have a strong balance sheet and a favorable maturity profile. Slide 11 illustrates the maturities of our long-term debt portfolio after the April 2020 bond issuance. Proceeds from the issuance will be utilized for general corporate purposes including increasing our liquidity and managing shorter-term debt maturities. With the addition of the new bonds, our weighted average cost of debt remains about 3.8%. Long-term debt due in 2022 includes $500 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility in the first quarter. This borrowing along with other short-term borrowings were repaid in April from existing cash and proceeds from our recent bond offering. Our bonds have a well-balanced maturity profile that reduces refinancing risk in any given year and the company benefits from a good mix of both dollar and euro-denominated debt. Before I turn the call over to Bob, please turn to Slide 12 and allow me to provide an update on the annual financial modeling guidance that we discussed last quarter. As we mentioned, we are reducing our 2020 plan for capital expenditures by $500 million to $1.9 billion. Approximately $200 million of the reduction is associated with profit-generating projects with the majority coming from the reduced pace of construction at our new PO/TBA facility. The reduced spending will become evident during the second half of this year. We remain committed to the completion of our strategic investment in the PO/TBA project and will resume full activities at the appropriate time. The remaining $300 million of the capital expenditure reduction is primarily associated with postponements and our planned maintenance schedule. In addition to CapEx savings, we no longer anticipate EBITDA impacts the business associated with major planned maintenance activities for the second half of 2020. We previously provided a cash interest estimate for 2020. We thought it easier for you to model using our interest expense for 2020, which is expected to be $410 million. This includes a credit for capitalized interest of approximately $45 million. 2020 annual depreciation and amortization continues to be forecast at $1.5 billion. We are reducing our plan for pension contributions in 2020 by $40 million to approximately $80 million and our pension expense remains estimated at $100 million. We are reducing our estimated 2020 effective tax rate from about 20% to an expectation in the mid-teens. The cash tax rate is expected to remain in the mid- to high-teens. The lower effective rate is related to both lower profitability and favorable impacts from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security or CARES Act. The CARES Act resulted in a higher first quarter tax expense due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities that was discrete to the first quarter. The net impact of the CARES Act to the full year is expected to be favorable. With that I will turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob?\nBob Patel: Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 13 and review our first quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the noncash LCM inventory charges. Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continue to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.1 billion. Profitability for both the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas and O&P, Europe, Asia and International segments were supported by our capability to switch amongst low-cost feedstocks and robust polymer demand from consumer-driven packaging and medical applications. Our Refining segment and the Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses within the I&D segment faced challenging market conditions created by reduced margins and demand for transportation fuels. The resiliency of our business portfolio continues to benefit from our relatively high participation in consumer-driven demand for nondurable products and a diverse global manufacturing footprint. Slide 14 highlights our differential feedstock flexibility relative to our peers at both our United States and European ethylene cracker assets. We can leverage the most economical feedstocks with respect to raw material costs and prices yielded from products. In North America, our two Midwest crackers in Clinton and Morris were built to utilize low cost stranded ethane and propane. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, three of our crackers can utilize the full range of feedstocks, ethane, propane, butane, Y-grade, mixed NGLs, condensate and naphtha, while the fourth cracker can flex amongst the most economical NGLs. This allows us to respond to feedstock prices and alleviate demand pressure on any one of the feedstocks. Our cracker system offers distinct advantages relative to new build crackers that can only run ethane. In a similar way, we have improved our flexibility in Europe with capabilities to run slightly more than 50% of our P28 using LPGs and other potentially advantaged raw materials. On slide 15, we highlight how this feedstock flexibility can provide advantaged margins for LyondellBasell. Integrated polyethylene margins in North America fluctuated in the first quarter as the advantage fee shifted from ethane, propane and butane to naphtha as the price of oil fell during March. We are able to follow the most economical feedstock to maximize profitability by switching among the raw materials used in our flexible crackers. In Europe, integrated polyethylene margins in March were the highest we have seen since 2015. We've been able to maximize value across naphtha, propane, butane and other advantaged feeds. With significant asset bases in both Europe and North America, LyondellBasell's overall results are less volatile than if our business was reliant upon only one region. With our feedstock flexibility in mind, let's review our first quarter results starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $477 million, $46 million lower than the fourth quarter. Profitability was driven by robust demand for polymers used in consumer packaging and medical applications, which supported improved polyethylene price spreads over ethylene monomer. Olefins results decreased approximately $110 million compared to the fourth quarter. Margins declined on lower ethylene sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in feedstock prices. Ethylene operating rates fell to about 87% for the quarter due to a planned maintenance turnaround for one of the two crackers at our ChannelView facility. Polyolefin results increased about $95 million during the first quarter, driven by an improvement in polyethylene price spread over ethylene of more than $105 per ton, primarily due to lower ethylene costs. During the first quarter, we advanced on our growth initiatives by launching production at our 500,000 ton per year Hyperzone high-density Polyethylene plant here on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our Hyperzone Polyethylene technology provides differential products for applications such as water pipes, industrial drums and intermediate bulk containers. We expect a more challenging second quarter with the unprecedented market conditions as a backdrop. While lower feedstock prices could reduce costs, uncertainties around oil price and weaker underlying demand could reduce polyolefins prices and volumes. Industry consultants predict that U.S. crackers will operate at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity during the second quarter and our assets are expected to operate in a similar range. Now please turn to slide 17 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $225 million, $81 million higher than the fourth quarter. Profitability was driven by lower feedstock prices, increased reliability and higher volumes. Olefins results increased more than $135 million, driven by an increase in ethylene margin due to lower prices for naphtha and other feedstocks. Volumes increased as cracker operating rates rose to 95% for the quarter due to improved reliability. Combined polyolefins results were comparable to the previous quarter. Polyethylene volume increased 15% over the fourth quarter, with increased consumer-driven demand for packaging, due to stay-at-home orders. Polyolefins margins declined, offsetting the improvement in volume. Reductions in both margins and volumes across our joint ventures contributed to a decline in equity income of approximately $35 million. We expect the second quarter to follow similar trends as the Americas with the benefits from lower feedstock costs muted by lower demand. Our European crackers are expected to operate at 80% to 85% of nameplate capacity during the second quarter. Please turn to slide 18. Let's take a look at our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $281 million, a $48 million decrease versus the prior quarter. Results were affected by a significant decline in gasoline demand that severely impacted oxyfuels margins beginning in February. First quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to higher volumes and margins. Intermediate Chemicals increased $15 million, driven by an increase in acetyl margins. Volumes were lower due to planned maintenance at our Channelview methanol unit. Oxyfuels and Related Products results decreased approximately $80 million, as a result of lower product prices. During February and March, Oxyfuels margins declined with weaker gasoline demand as global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders became more widespread. We expect further declines for the segment into Q2, as lackluster demand for propylene oxide and polyurethane applications and continued pressure on oxyfuels demand and margins will likely persist through the second quarter. On slide 19, let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. First quarter EBITDA was $115 million $53 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes and margins increased with typical seasonal improvements that were muted by pandemic-related shutdowns in automotive end-markets. First quarter pre-tax integration costs were $14 million. Compounding & Solutions results increased approximately $30 million due to higher margins and volumes. Seasonal volume improvements were partially offset by declines in automotive end-market demand during March. Advanced Polymers results increased about $10 million supported by improved seasonal construction demand. Our team is making continued progress on the integration efforts related to the 2018 acquisition of A. Schulman. Integration activities are on schedule to achieve $200 million in forward annual run rate synergies by the third quarter of this year. During the second quarter we expect profitability for the segment to be increasingly impacted by severe reductions in demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end-markets. As I mentioned, we have temporarily idled production at several of our small plants in response to manufacturing plant closures across the automotive industry. Now let's turn to slide 20 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $80 million, $102 million decline versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Results were driven by a decline in crack spreads and an unplanned outage on our fluidized catalytic cracker unit. In the first quarter the MAYA 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread decreased to an average of $17.21 per barrel for the quarter. Unplanned maintenance at our Houston Refinery reduced the average crude throughput by over 40,000 barrels per day to 226,000 barrels per day for the quarter. The refining market has been challenged by falling prices and demand for transportation fuels, including gasoline and jet fuel. We anticipate that these factors will continue to pressure our refining results, until societal restrictions ease and demand for transportation fuels returns to typical levels later in the year. Our fluid catalytic cracker unit at the refinery returned to service in late April and we are currently operating the refinery at 85% to 90% of nameplate crude throughput. Please turn to slide 21, as we review the results of our Technology segment. During the first quarter, Technology segment EBITDA was $56 million, a decrease of $82 million compared to the record results from the fourth quarter of 2019. Catalyst volumes and margins remained steady, while licensing revenue declined due to fewer revenue milestones during the quarter. Our Technology segment licenses polymer production technologies for new manufacturing plants that enable subsequent catalyst sales to licensing customers over the lifetime of the asset. Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones results in an uneven pace for licensing revenues. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming milestones, we expect that second quarter licensing profitability will return to the higher levels of recent quarters. Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook with slide 22. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged assets continued to deliver resilient results. Our foundations in leveraging our feedstock flexibility, with our low operating costs and high asset utilization serves us well during any point in the cycle. We remain consistent with our capital deployment strategy that supports our dividend with efficient cash generation and disciplined allocation of capital expenditures for required maintenance and profit-generating growth projects. All decisions are grounded by our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. We anticipate that challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and plummeting oil prices that arose during the first quarter will extend for much of the year. Demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually rebound as various regions emerge from societal restrictions return to work and regain comfort with prior travel patterns. Markets for discretionary durable goods will likely take longer to recover from the downturn. We expect that robust consumer-driven demand for our products in packaging and medical applications will continue. LyondellBasell is addressing these challenges by proactively reducing costs working capital and capital expenditures, while prioritizing and increasing liquidity. Our company is really well positioned to navigate these challenging markets and emerge stronger with the eventual rebound of the global economy. We will now please take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we do have a question in the queue from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJohn McNulty: Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I guess when we look at this recession it's different than past ones, because of the quarantining and the impact of that or the compounding effect of that. It seems like when the quarantining starts to end there's a couple of your businesses Refining & Oxyfuels that should kind of snap back pretty quickly. But how should we think about the rest of the businesses and the potential impact that maybe the quarantine is having on it where you might as that ends start to get relief maybe earlier than just the broader macro? Is there a way to think about that?\nBob Patel: Yeah, John. Good morning. The way we think about it is we have packaging and medical which is probably nearly half of the company essentially; and then durable goods auto is probably about 20%, 25%; and then the fuels and oxyfuels and so on is the remainder. I think that, we should see demand improve even further, if the economies are opened, because typically in the summertime as you know we see seasonal effects and we see increases in demand. So relatively speaking, we could see more of that on the packaging side. And on fuels you said it rightly that as people get on the road and drive more our oxyfuels and refining business should improve. So kind of the way we're thinking about it is automobile production and demand will probably be the slowest to return. But it's a pretty small part of our business.\nOperator: The next question is from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. If your Bora project the cracker and downstream polyethylene plant, if they were \u2013 if that was onstream today and you were able to receive naphtha as an internal transfer from your partner's refinery how would the integrated margin of that \u2013 complex compared to say your naphtha-based margins in Europe and your U.S. Gulf margins?\nBob Patel: Yeah. Good morning, Steve. Indeed, if it was running, we'd have decent margins probably in the $400 to $500 per ton integrated basis range. You'll recall that, the thesis around that investment is about producing in China for China and the benefit of that project for us beyond getting a bigger position in China is that the timing of the investment will be such that when we make our capital infusion, it will be very close to start-up so within a quarter or two. But decent margins today, if it was running.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nDavid Begleiter: Good morning, Bob.\nBob Patel: Hey, good morning, David.\nDavid Begleiter: Bob, just on polyethylene prices. Consultants said they fell $0.04 in April. Do you agree and they're calling for another $0.06 in May and June for combined $0.10 decline in Q2. Again do you agree? Do you think that's too severe?\nBob Patel: Yeah, David. I think even the $0.04, I would say it's \u2013 that may be more of a headline number as opposed to kind of realized when you look through all of the different end-use segments that we supply. In terms of the outlook with ethane price rising like it has, difficult to imagine that you'd have that, kind of, a large step down. And again as I mentioned earlier, on the demand side, packaging related demand is still very good. We're coming into the summer season. And as different state economies in the U.S. start to open and outdoor activities actually are safer than indoor activities and that drives packaging demand. So if we see some increase in demand seasonally, it seems to me that we have a decent market environment. And in our case, we're running our assets in olefins and polyolefins in the U.S. at about 70% today. So pretty decent rate given the environment we're in.\nOperator: Next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open\nVincent Andrews: Thanks, and good morning everyone. Bob, wondering if you could talk a bit about the concern that's out there that with -- lower oil prices will have less associated gas production, and therefore less NGL production. So as gas does go above $3, $3.50 wherever it goes, what do you think happens to ethane and propane prices?\nBob Patel: Yeah. So Vincent in terms of ethane supply/demand, we're all working to get our arms around what could happen. But here's the way I think about it. First of all, there's quite a bit that's being rejected today, maybe as much as 350,000 barrels a day of ethane being rejected. So, of course, that rejection would get shut off. And then in times past what we've seen is, if ethane is still snug and values rise especially in the low oil price environment, you'd see feedstock flexibility kick in. And a company like us, which who have a lot of feedstock flexibility, we would tilt more towards liquids and LPGs. And beyond that, some of the exports could even get shut off for ethane. So it seems to me that what we're really trying to think through is could we have another spike as opposed to a sustained period of high ethane prices. Because in the end, we continue to believe that there's an abundance of ethane available in the U.S. and higher prices will just attract more investment and more supply of ethane over the long-term. So it's more about thinking through transitory effects. And I think a company like ours that has so much feedstock flexibility; we can manage through that probably better than most.\nOperator: Next question is from Arun Viswanathan from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Hope you're all well. I guess, I just wanted to ask about polypropylene. So when you look at supply/demand and what's going on with the compounding and automotive, would you expect -- and then also feedstocks as well. Would you expect any capacity reductions in polypropylene over the next year or two? Maybe just your comment on your outlook for polypropylene? Thanks.\nBob Patel: Yeah. Arun, it could be that some of the high-cost capacity in Europe or U.S. is idled. But more importantly what we've observed so far is projects are starting to get delayed, excluding China. But elsewhere in the world, if you look up in North America and other parts of the world those are the first signs of change. And frankly we're seeing that even in polyethylene. So one of the outcomes of the period that we're going through is delays in new construction. And I certainly see that in polypropylene.\nOperator: Next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is now open.\nP.J. Juvekar: Hey, Bob, good to hear from you.\nBob Patel: Good morning, P.J.\nP.J. Juvekar: Good morning. Just a quick question. Given the planned shutdowns globally, where are your inventories of polyethylene and polypropylene? Where are they for the industry? And in this type of environment usually converters begin to destock anticipating lower prices. Where do we stand on that? And what, kind of, working capital do you expect to release given lower raw materials, lower inventories et cetera? Thank you.\nBob Patel: Yeah. Thank you, P.J. Well, inventory reduction has been a very, very high focus for us over the last 75 days or so. We started reducing inventories back in late February and early March. And so today for our polyolefins, we're sitting at 30 days or so of inventory based on lower demand rates. So we've already adjusted for anticipated lower demand rate and we'll continue to do that. And essentially what we're doing is, we're short cycling our product wheel to preferentially produce the products where there's high demand. And only produce to order be in areas where we believe there's low demand or low visibility on demand. And your question about working capital reduction and cash release, we expect about $500 million of cash release from lower working capital as we work our way through this year. Most of that benefit should come through in Q2 with a little bit of tailing benefit in Q3.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open. \nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning, Bob. You know, one of the effects of the pandemic seems to be rapidly changing consumer and government attitudes towards single-use plastics. What are you observing in that area? And do you anticipate any backlash reversion that would lead to a structural benefit in addition to the other sort of working and staying at home cooking at home benefits that you alluded to in the prepared remarks?\nBob Patel: Hey. Good morning, Kevin. We do see some structural benefits, I think, accruing to both polyethylene and polypropylene for some time given what's happened. Reversal of bag bans on the West Coast on the East Coast those could stay for a while. I think what people are realizing is that there are very significant hygienic benefits to plastics and that single-use has benefits. The key thing that we have to remember that won't change is that the challenge of plastic waste still remains. And I can tell you that we as a company have not lost our focus on that. And I think as an industry the focus on plastic waste, addressing, recycling, increasing capture of waste before it gets in the environment that's something that we should continue our focus on as an industry and we certainly will continue as a company. And then as single-use applications increase in demand, I think, society can be confident that that single-use waste won't end up in the environment. So plastic waste will continue to be an area of emphasis for us.\nOperator: Next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc. Your line is now open. \nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Bob, you mentioned that benchmark margins for ethylene polyethylene in Europe were fairly high close to record. At the same time, your EBITDA was up sequentially, but below 2019 and 2019 averages. So A, could you explain why that is? And B, if these benchmarks decline in the second quarter should your EBITDA decline less than the benchmark would apply?\nBob Patel: Well so, Aleksey it's probably more about timing during the quarter in terms of the margins. In Europe as the oil price decline, we did see a margin expansion. And that's very typical in Europe. And I think it speaks to again the diversity of our asset base. And in a lower oil price environment we generally see better contribution from our European assets. We likely will see some margin erosion in Europe as we work through Q2 and as things normalize a bit more and the new, sort of, lower oil price environment sets in. We do expect some margin erosion in Europe. But demand is decent in Europe. Frankly, we're running our O&P assets at about 80% in Europe today. And as economies over there open up, we think that going into the summer season we could run at pretty good rates in this 80% to 85% range through the summer.\nOperator: Next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is now open. \nDuffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning, folks. Question just around the differential between say U.S. ethane-based and kind of European and Asian naphtha-based. Obviously, as oils come down on paper at least those two regions look extremely competitive. How quickly do you think as they ramp up some of their production rates do you think the by-products from the naphtha will start to readjust to lower levels? So the propylenes, the benzene, the butadienes that kind of stuff. Can you walk through how you see that playing out the rest of this year?\nBob Patel: Yes. Hey, good morning. Duffy, actually the byproduct disposition is already playing out. And C4 is -- butadienes containment is a real challenge. And so our strategy is that we don't want to build inventory on butadiene. And so we'll crack liquids up to a point where we can move the butadiene and I think that's already globally been restricting the amount of naphtha that's being cracked. And so we've had -- over the past 10 years, I was thinking about this that we've had probably two or three periods like this where a coproduct disposition became a challenge. Typically, it doesn't last that long. And in the current environment some automobile production coming back and people driving and replacing tires should provide some relief. But, I think, it will continue to be a constraint through most of this year, especially, disposition of butadiene. And again our strategy even in the U.S. where we have significant feedstock flexibility, we will maximize liquids up to a point where we're not building inventory of C4s.\nOperator: Next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nDylan Campbell: Good morning. This is Dylan Campbell on for Bob. \nBob Patel: Good morning.\nDylan Campbell: A question kind of on the cash flow profile. You mentioned kind of working capital improvement. Would you be able to size that at any degree in terms of how much of those are your intrinsic improvements versus the decline in oil prices? And then also on CapEx, what kind of $1.1 billion of growth CapEx still embedded in the total CapEx number for the year? Is there further room for that to decline this year?\nBob Patel: Yeah. Hey, good morning, Dylan. Let me answer the question in terms of how we're -- the actions we've taken to increase cash flow. So as I mentioned earlier, working capital release we expect to be about $500 million, mostly in Q2 with some trailing benefits in Q3. CapEx, we've reduced on a cash basis by about $500 million from $2.4 billion to $1.9 billion. Most of that $500 million benefit will be evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. In addition to that, we've undertaken -- we've accelerated our cost-reduction initiatives that we started in September of last year. We expect those to provide additional benefit this year on a cash basis of between $150 million and $200 million. So when you kind of total all that up, between the working capital the CapEx and the cash basis cost reduction, we expect that we should boost cash flow this year by about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and the timing will start in Q2 through the end of the year.\nOperator: Next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nMike Sison: Hey, guys. Hey, Bob. How you\u2019re doing?\nBob Patel: Hey, good morning.\nMike Sison: Just sort of a longer-term question. When you think about your EBITDA in olefins both Americas and EAI, I think you're going to be down this year right, and given a lot of the challenges that we have in the economy. So when you think about in a better volume environment hopefully over time and rebuilding that margin over time. Can you maybe walk us through the variables between oil, and how much volume recovery comes back in terms of your EBITDA maybe on a more normalized EBITDA margin basis longer term?\nBob Patel: Yeah. I mean I think in the near term Mike, we have decent visibility here with Q2 and into Q3. Q4 all of us are keeping an eye on whether we're going to have another wave of the virus or not. And it's an unknown. It's something that's difficult to predict. But if I look beyond the pandemic and look beyond the current period of low oil prices, I mean if history is an indicator, typically oil prices do rebound within 24 months. Now, at the moment we also have a lot of inventory to work through. So, we're not expecting significant improvement in oil price for most of this year. But I do think that if you were to look 24 months out, you could see oil prices at higher levels. Likely, we'll also see project delays and cancellations, and I think -- and some demand improvement, benefit from pent-up demand, which should set up a very good supply/demand environment 24 months out -- 12 to 24 months out. But our focus is to make sure that we maximize cash flow and maximize liquidity in the near term. And make sure that we keep our focus on the long-term projects that we've initiated.\nOperator: Next question is from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Your line is now open.\nFrank Mitsch: Good morning, gentlemen. I'm glad to hear you're all doing well.\nBob Patel: Good morning, Frank.\nMichael McMurray: Good morning.\nFrank Mitsch: Hey, Bob, you mentioned that all the major plants are running although some of the smaller plants in APS are idle. I'm just curious I assume you looked at perhaps idling some polyethylene capacity as others have. What do you come out on the pros and cons of doing that? And what would be the likelihood that Lyondell would go that route?\nBob Patel: Yeah. We don't -- Frank we haven't really seen demand decline to a level where we would consider idling polyethylene capacity. So our sense is that here in April, we're kind of seeing a near-term bottom in demand, because I would imagine that as economies partially reopen directionally that should help on the demand side. And as I was stating earlier on one of the other questions that in a partial lockdown or reduced mobility mode for the rest of the year perhaps, we think that packaging is a beneficiary of that. So our expectation is that in the U.S., we're going to run kind of 70%, 80% across our assets. And olefins and polyolefins in Europe 80%, 85%, and we don't really foresee needing to idle for a long period of time in the polyethylene.\nOperator: Next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Bob when you contemplate the experience of Lyondell, both in its business performance and its share price during the current recession, does it change your view concerning the distribution of dividend increase and share repurchase in the future for Lyondell? That is do you think that your behavior in allocating your free cash flow in the future will change because of your experience this year?\nBob Patel: Yes. Thank you for that question Jeff. Well in the near term, as I mentioned, given lack of visibility in terms of the outlook beyond Q3, really our priorities are to maximize liquidity. In terms of capital allocation, we're very consistent in our view that the dividend is a high priority for us coupled with a strong BBB or investment-grade rating, which today is BBB for us. So I don't expect that we would undertake buybacks given that we're prioritizing liquidity. Our dividend we expect that we will recommend the May dividend to our Board. We expect that they'll approve that dividend for Q2. Given the visibility that we have and the improvements we've made in terms of working capital CapEx and the cash cost savings, we think that we can largely cover the dividend for the full year. And I think your question we'll be in a better position to answer when we get to later in the year about capital allocation. Today, the priority is maximize liquidity, maximize cash flow and all of those will allow us to continue -- enable us to continue to pay the dividend largely from operating cash flow for the balance of the year.\nOperator: Next question is from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nJonas Oxgaard: Thank you. A question on the refining of the oxyfuels. It seems that the main issues right now is because of the lack of fuel demand. So can you give us an idea for what should those businesses look like after the lockdown is over? Crude is still $30 $40 probably. But we're driving again.\nBob Patel: Yes. So in refining Jonas, the light-heavy differential is a very, very significant driver for earnings followed by diesel cracks. Our refinery given that it's a heavy crude oil processing refinery and we make a significant amount of coke as a result, in this environment, it actually favors our refinery because of the amount of diesel that we produce. We've mentioned in prior earnings calls and other venues that we expect that our refinery under more normalized conditions should earn about $100 million in EBITDA per quarter. It will be a challenge to get to that level this year because we still need more supply of sour crude oil. But we do think that the higher level of diesel production as a portion of the total yield favors us in our refinery. In oxyfuels, we should start to see some benefits from the volume rising. Higher oil price also helps in terms of oxyfuel profitability. So both should directionally improve as the lockdowns are eased and as activity at least daily activity returns to more normal levels.\nOperator: Next question is from John Roberts from UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Roberts: Thank you. I'm glad you're all so well. If you were able to switch to 100% heavy feedstocks, would you be able to place all of the extra coproducts in this soft market?\nBob Patel: Yes. No, we would not be able to do that. And again, butadiene would be probably our greatest challenge today and it's what limits us in terms of how much liquids we can crack. Our capability, we had two crackers at ChannelView that produce about 4 billion pounds of ethylene in total. We can crack all liquids at those two crackers. And in terms of our Corpus Christi cracker, we can crack about two-thirds non-ethane feed. So we have significant flexibility. But today, we could not place all the C4s. And as I said earlier, we do not intend to build inventory.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Blair from Tudor Pickering Holt. Your line is now open.\nMatthew Blair: Hey, good morning, Bob, glad to hear you are safe and sound. I just had a question. Could you compare polypropylene demand with PE demand? Which is holding up better and why?\nBob Patel: Yeah, good morning, Matthew good to hear from you. They're both resilient for different reasons. In polyethylene, the areas of weakness have been around construction, but we expect that that's more seasonal and that will pick up. In polypropylene, it's more about auto being weak. But on the other hand, it's been offset by the melt-blown-type of products that are going into PPE for first responders and there's quite a bit of packaging in polypropylene. If I really had to call one or the other, I would say maybe on the margin polypropylene is a little bit weaker than polyethylene, just because of the auto content. But both are holding up pretty well. And as I mentioned earlier, we're running our assets at 70% plus here in the U.S.\nMichael McMurray: And Matthew, the only other thing I would add is the export market from North America for polyethylene isn't as strong as it was earlier in the year. So that's a particular weakness here in the second quarter anyways until China starts producing for the rest of the world again.\nOperator: The final question in the queue is from Hassan Ahmed from Alembic Global Advisors. Your line is now open.\nHassan Ahmed: Good morning, Bob.\nBob Patel: Good morning.\nHassan Ahmed: Bob I wanted to revisit some of the comments you made about your dividend. Having taken a glance at the 10-K, it seems that, as I take a look at the covenants and the like, that if LTM EBITDA -- net debt-to-EBITDA sort of approaches or exceeds 3.5 times. I guess, the verbiage was that there are certain restrictions that are put on dividend outlay. So, obviously LTM kind of looking fairly sort of decent right now, but if this pandemic or certain lockdowns were to last longer if there was COVID-related sort of lockdowns to pop up later on, as we go through the course of the year. Maybe, if we start approaching LTM levels of I'd say close to $3 million slightly north of $3 billion dividend start becoming a bit more questionable, just wanted to sort of hear your thoughts about that.\nBob Patel: Yeah. You know Hassan EBITDA levels, at the kind of levels, you're describing would be extremely low. But I'll invite Michael to comment on the covenants.\nMichael McMurray: Yeah. So one thing to keep in mind in regards to the covenants, so you're right, it was -- there is a covenant related to total debt-to-EBITDA at greater than 3.5 times. You'll note from some recent filings, if you've gone through them, we decided it was prudent to actually get credit for cash on sheet. And so instead of a total debt it's now a net debt covenant. So again as Bob said that outlook from an EBITDA perspective is pretty dire and it would probably have to continue for some period of time. And then -- but I did want to point out that we actually did get some covenant relief as well, going from total debt to net debt.\nBob Patel: Okay. Good. Well, thank you for all your questions. I'd like to close with a few comments. As I mentioned earlier we're anticipating and we're ready to address continued challenges as we progress through the current year. Our consistent focus on cash generation disciplined capital allocation will serve us well, in this challenging environment. We're leveraging our leading portfolio, advantaged positions to extend our track record of strong cash generation, profitable growth initiatives and prudent financial policies to deliver sustainable value for you our shareholders. So we thank you for your interest in our company. And look forward to updating you in July, on our second quarter results. So with that, we're adjourned. Have a great weekend.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at this time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. Slide 8 illustrates our relatively consistent cash flow performance over the past five years. Over the last 12 months, 90% of our EBITDA translated into cash from operating activities. With approximately $1 billion dedicated to maintaining our assets, our free operating cash flow remained relatively healthy at $3.8 billion. As you heard from Bob, we are putting a significant amount of focus on cash generation and liquidity. Now please turn to Slide 9, where we provide further details on cash generation for the first quarter. You can see that our business has generated $500 million of cash from operating activities during the first quarter, down just over $100 million from one year ago. During the first quarter, we increased our cash on hand to $1.8 billion in an abundance of caution with borrowings from our revolving credit, accounts receivable and commercial paper facilities. Capital expenditures were approximately $660 million, as we continue to move forward on our PO/TBA plant. In the first quarter, we paid $351 million in dividends to our shareholders. As Bob mentioned, we have developed strategies to respond to a variety of economic scenarios. Slide 10 outlines the actions we have taken to maximize liquidity. We are increasing cash inflows by accelerating cost-saving initiatives and reducing working capital. At the end of March we had $3.2 billion in liquidity. We further bolstered this liquidity through the successful issuance of $2 billion in senior notes in April at very attractive long-term rates. With the slowdown of our PO/TBA plant construction, postponement of growth projects and some deferral of planned maintenance will reduce our 2020 capital expenditures by $500 million relative to our prior guidance. In the current uncertain environment, we will prioritize liquidity over share repurchases and any potential M&A activities. We have a strong balance sheet and a favorable maturity profile. Slide 11 illustrates the maturities of our long-term debt portfolio after the April 2020 bond issuance. Proceeds from the issuance will be utilized for general corporate purposes including increasing our liquidity and managing shorter-term debt maturities. With the addition of the new bonds, our weighted average cost of debt remains about 3.8%. Long-term debt due in 2022 includes $500 million borrowed under our revolving credit facility in the first quarter. This borrowing along with other short-term borrowings were repaid in April from existing cash and proceeds from our recent bond offering. Our bonds have a well-balanced maturity profile that reduces refinancing risk in any given year and the company benefits from a good mix of both dollar and euro-denominated debt. Before I turn the call over to Bob, please turn to Slide 12 and allow me to provide an update on the annual financial modeling guidance that we discussed last quarter. As we mentioned, we are reducing our 2020 plan for capital expenditures by $500 million to $1.9 billion. Approximately $200 million of the reduction is associated with profit-generating projects with the majority coming from the reduced pace of construction at our new PO/TBA facility. The reduced spending will become evident during the second half of this year. We remain committed to the completion of our strategic investment in the PO/TBA project and will resume full activities at the appropriate time. The remaining $300 million of the capital expenditure reduction is primarily associated with postponements and our planned maintenance schedule. In addition to CapEx savings, we no longer anticipate EBITDA impacts the business associated with major planned maintenance activities for the second half of 2020. We previously provided a cash interest estimate for 2020. We thought it easier for you to model using our interest expense for 2020, which is expected to be $410 million. This includes a credit for capitalized interest of approximately $45 million. 2020 annual depreciation and amortization continues to be forecast at $1.5 billion. We are reducing our plan for pension contributions in 2020 by $40 million to approximately $80 million and our pension expense remains estimated at $100 million. We are reducing our estimated 2020 effective tax rate from about 20% to an expectation in the mid-teens. The cash tax rate is expected to remain in the mid- to high-teens. The lower effective rate is related to both lower profitability and favorable impacts from the U.S. Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security or CARES Act. The CARES Act resulted in a higher first quarter tax expense due to a revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities that was discrete to the first quarter. The net impact of the CARES Act to the full year is expected to be favorable. With that I will turn the call back to Bob for a more detailed discussion of our segment results. Bob? Good morning. And Matthew, the only other thing I would add is the export market from North America for polyethylene isn't as strong as it was earlier in the year. So that's a particular weakness here in the second quarter anyways until China starts producing for the rest of the world again. Yeah. So one thing to keep in mind in regards to the covenants, so you're right, it was -- there is a covenant related to total debt-to-EBITDA at greater than 3.5 times. You'll note from some recent filings, if you've gone through them, we decided it was prudent to actually get credit for cash on sheet. And so instead of a total debt it's now a net debt covenant. So again as Bob said that outlook from an EBITDA perspective is pretty dire and it would probably have to continue for some period of time. And then -- but I did want to point out that we actually did get some covenant relief as well, going from total debt to net debt."

            "name": "Bob Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you participating around the world. I hope that you, your colleagues, and your families are all staying healthy during these difficult times. We appreciate you taking the time to join us today as we discuss our Q1 results. Let's begin with slide three and review the first quarter highlights. LyondellBasell's business portfolio continued to deliver relatively resilient performance amid challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic, rapidly falling oil prices, and deteriorating economic activity. Our global asset footprint, feedstock flexibility, and disciplined financial strategies are serving us well and enabling us to navigate through these unprecedented market conditions. Our first quarter EBITDA $1.1 billion represents a decline of approximately 12% relative to the fourth quarter and 25% relative to the first quarter of the prior year. Despite robust demand for our polymers used in consumer packaging and medical applications, profitability was impacted by soft demand for our transportation fuels and products used in automotive and other durable goods end markets. Events surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and the drop in oil prices continue to evolve and impact global markets for our products. Let's turn to slide four and review our approach to mitigate the effects from these headwinds. Currently, all of our major manufacturing sites are operating. In response to lower demand for certain products, we temporarily idled production at several small plants in our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment serving automotive end-markets and appropriately decreased production rates and other plans to match reduced end-market demand. Industry consultants estimate that petrochemical and refining assets in various parts of the world are running at 60% to 80% of nameplate capacity. We expect that the majority of LyondellBasell's capacity will also operate within that range during the second quarter. Our manufacturing operations have been declared as an essential industry, supporting society's needs to fight the pandemic in the majority of the regions in which we operate. We implemented best practices recommended by medical professionals and governmental bodies to protect our employees, contractors, assets, and the communities where we operate around the world, while maintaining business continuity with our customers and suppliers. Since the activation of our global pandemic response team in late January, we instituted social distancing practices, escalated our sanitization protocols, and increased employee health monitoring at all of our manufacturing sites. Our office-based employees worked productively from home as the pandemic spread from Asia to Europe then to the Americas. We are implementing processes to enable a safe and full return to workplaces as conditions permit around the world. The majority of our 1,000 employees in China are now back in our plants and offices. I want to thank and acknowledge our over 19,000 LyondellBasell employees for their tireless innovation, dedication, and sense of ownership they have exhibited for our company during these difficult times. Since the full extent of the pandemic, the drop in oil prices and the economic downturn remains uncertain. We are acting on strategies to respond to a range of economic scenarios. Over the past few quarters, we have been working on meaningful cost-saving initiatives across the company. Those initiatives have been accelerated. In response to falling demand, we instituted more aggressive inventory management policies. When combined with lower prices for raw materials and products, we expect these actions will provide a meaningful release of cash from working capital, during 2020. In order to reduce operational and financial risk, we postponed selected growth projects and planned maintenance, including slowing construction activities, on our PO/TBA plant. We currently expect these actions will reduce 2020 capital expenditures by approximately 20%, from our prior guidance of $2.4 billion to our current outlook of $1.9 billion. During April, strong demand for our investment-grade bonds enabled us to increase liquidity by $2 billion, with a successful offering that resulted in the lowest U.S. dollar interest rates in the history of our company. We remain confident that our resilient cash generation and disciplined approach to capital deployment will serve us well during these challenging times. Our focus on funding the dividend, while remaining committed to a strong investment-grade balance sheet, plays an integral role to our shareholder value proposition. We believe that our actions to reduce operating costs, capital expenditures and working capital will generate sufficient free cash flow over the coming quarters. In the event of a prolonged or deeper downturn, we will act pragmatically and evaluate all prudent options. In March, lower oil prices and reduced demand for transportation fuels, negatively impacted both volumes and margins for our Refining segment and our Oxyfuels & Related Products business within the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Global shutdowns by automotive manufacturers, sharply reduced demand for our polypropylene compounds within the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Consumer-driven demand for polyolefins used in packaging and health care products, supported relatively stable integrated polyethylene margins, in the Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. Lower feedstock prices resulted in higher integrated polyethylene margins for our O&P \u2013 Europe, Asia and International segment. While we expect that demand for durable goods will take some time to recover lasting changes in consumer lifestyles may have beneficial mid-term implications for some of our large end-use markets. On slide 5, we show some recent North American market research that suggests changes in consumer buying habits that could endure beyond the current crisis. As you may have experienced consumer stockpiled home pantries as it became clear that societal restrictions were required to slow the spread of the virus. LyondellBasell felt this surge for our polymers used in consumer packaging to safely deliver food, medicines and other essential products to households around the world. The need for plastic packaging increased as society moved from bulk volumes used in workplaces and restaurants, towards smaller package sizes delivered and consumed in the home. Excessive demand for paper goods has subsided. And thankfully most stockpiles of home health care products do not require replenishment. But lifestyle changes are creating a new normal as consumer-based demand for frozen, dairy and packaged food has risen by approximately 30%. Surveys indicate that after staying at home during the pandemic, 40% of Americans plan to increase the amount of time they work from home and 65% intend to eat at home, more often. These changes are likely to increase demand for the polyolefin packaging that is typically used in these applications. Let's turn to slide 6 and review our recent safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to health and safety has become even more relevant to our employees, contractors and communities, during the pandemic. Our employees have continued to deliver top quartile, if not top decile safety performance, despite numerous potential distractions through these difficult times. Earlier, I mentioned our precautionary measures to increase the frequency and intensity of our workplace, sanitization, social distancing practices, health monitoring and self-reporting processes, to reduce the spread of the virus among our workforce. Our processes have proven effective, with limited virus spread across our global employee population. LyondellBasell's manufacturing operations have been designated as an essential industry to support society's needs during the pandemic. Let's turn to slide 7, where we highlight LyondellBasell's role in supplying vital products that support health care, hygiene and medical needs. For example, our polypropylene resins are used by customers to produce melt-blown fibers that provide filtration in face masks. Our masterbatch products are used to produce breathable films. Our polyethylene is used for protective clothing, draping and medical packaging. And our polypropylene, ethanol, isopropanol, ethylene oxide and propylene oxide are used to make syringes, tubing, test kits, soaps, disinfectants, medical devices and many other products. With that I will turn the call over to Michael, who will lead us through several topics related to our financial performance. Thank you, Michael. Let's turn to Slide 13 and review our first quarter performance. As mentioned previously, my discussion of business results will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the noncash LCM inventory charges. Our global footprint and diverse business portfolio continue to provide resiliency in this challenging market environment. EBITDA for the first quarter was $1.1 billion. Profitability for both the Olefins and Polyolefins Americas and O&P, Europe, Asia and International segments were supported by our capability to switch amongst low-cost feedstocks and robust polymer demand from consumer-driven packaging and medical applications. Our Refining segment and the Oxyfuels & Related Products businesses within the I&D segment faced challenging market conditions created by reduced margins and demand for transportation fuels. The resiliency of our business portfolio continues to benefit from our relatively high participation in consumer-driven demand for nondurable products and a diverse global manufacturing footprint. Slide 14 highlights our differential feedstock flexibility relative to our peers at both our United States and European ethylene cracker assets. We can leverage the most economical feedstocks with respect to raw material costs and prices yielded from products. In North America, our two Midwest crackers in Clinton and Morris were built to utilize low cost stranded ethane and propane. On the U.S. Gulf Coast, three of our crackers can utilize the full range of feedstocks, ethane, propane, butane, Y-grade, mixed NGLs, condensate and naphtha, while the fourth cracker can flex amongst the most economical NGLs. This allows us to respond to feedstock prices and alleviate demand pressure on any one of the feedstocks. Our cracker system offers distinct advantages relative to new build crackers that can only run ethane. In a similar way, we have improved our flexibility in Europe with capabilities to run slightly more than 50% of our P28 using LPGs and other potentially advantaged raw materials. On slide 15, we highlight how this feedstock flexibility can provide advantaged margins for LyondellBasell. Integrated polyethylene margins in North America fluctuated in the first quarter as the advantage fee shifted from ethane, propane and butane to naphtha as the price of oil fell during March. We are able to follow the most economical feedstock to maximize profitability by switching among the raw materials used in our flexible crackers. In Europe, integrated polyethylene margins in March were the highest we have seen since 2015. We've been able to maximize value across naphtha, propane, butane and other advantaged feeds. With significant asset bases in both Europe and North America, LyondellBasell's overall results are less volatile than if our business was reliant upon only one region. With our feedstock flexibility in mind, let's review our first quarter results starting with our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment on slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $477 million, $46 million lower than the fourth quarter. Profitability was driven by robust demand for polymers used in consumer packaging and medical applications, which supported improved polyethylene price spreads over ethylene monomer. Olefins results decreased approximately $110 million compared to the fourth quarter. Margins declined on lower ethylene sales prices, partially offset by a decrease in feedstock prices. Ethylene operating rates fell to about 87% for the quarter due to a planned maintenance turnaround for one of the two crackers at our ChannelView facility. Polyolefin results increased about $95 million during the first quarter, driven by an improvement in polyethylene price spread over ethylene of more than $105 per ton, primarily due to lower ethylene costs. During the first quarter, we advanced on our growth initiatives by launching production at our 500,000 ton per year Hyperzone high-density Polyethylene plant here on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Our Hyperzone Polyethylene technology provides differential products for applications such as water pipes, industrial drums and intermediate bulk containers. We expect a more challenging second quarter with the unprecedented market conditions as a backdrop. While lower feedstock prices could reduce costs, uncertainties around oil price and weaker underlying demand could reduce polyolefins prices and volumes. Industry consultants predict that U.S. crackers will operate at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity during the second quarter and our assets are expected to operate in a similar range. Now please turn to slide 17 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $225 million, $81 million higher than the fourth quarter. Profitability was driven by lower feedstock prices, increased reliability and higher volumes. Olefins results increased more than $135 million, driven by an increase in ethylene margin due to lower prices for naphtha and other feedstocks. Volumes increased as cracker operating rates rose to 95% for the quarter due to improved reliability. Combined polyolefins results were comparable to the previous quarter. Polyethylene volume increased 15% over the fourth quarter, with increased consumer-driven demand for packaging, due to stay-at-home orders. Polyolefins margins declined, offsetting the improvement in volume. Reductions in both margins and volumes across our joint ventures contributed to a decline in equity income of approximately $35 million. We expect the second quarter to follow similar trends as the Americas with the benefits from lower feedstock costs muted by lower demand. Our European crackers are expected to operate at 80% to 85% of nameplate capacity during the second quarter. Please turn to slide 18. Let's take a look at our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $281 million, a $48 million decrease versus the prior quarter. Results were affected by a significant decline in gasoline demand that severely impacted oxyfuels margins beginning in February. First quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results increased approximately $25 million due to higher volumes and margins. Intermediate Chemicals increased $15 million, driven by an increase in acetyl margins. Volumes were lower due to planned maintenance at our Channelview methanol unit. Oxyfuels and Related Products results decreased approximately $80 million, as a result of lower product prices. During February and March, Oxyfuels margins declined with weaker gasoline demand as global travel restrictions and stay-at-home orders became more widespread. We expect further declines for the segment into Q2, as lackluster demand for propylene oxide and polyurethane applications and continued pressure on oxyfuels demand and margins will likely persist through the second quarter. On slide 19, let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. First quarter EBITDA was $115 million $53 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes and margins increased with typical seasonal improvements that were muted by pandemic-related shutdowns in automotive end-markets. First quarter pre-tax integration costs were $14 million. Compounding & Solutions results increased approximately $30 million due to higher margins and volumes. Seasonal volume improvements were partially offset by declines in automotive end-market demand during March. Advanced Polymers results increased about $10 million supported by improved seasonal construction demand. Our team is making continued progress on the integration efforts related to the 2018 acquisition of A. Schulman. Integration activities are on schedule to achieve $200 million in forward annual run rate synergies by the third quarter of this year. During the second quarter we expect profitability for the segment to be increasingly impacted by severe reductions in demand for our polypropylene compounds utilized in automotive end-markets. As I mentioned, we have temporarily idled production at several of our small plants in response to manufacturing plant closures across the automotive industry. Now let's turn to slide 20 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $80 million, $102 million decline versus the fourth quarter of 2019. Results were driven by a decline in crack spreads and an unplanned outage on our fluidized catalytic cracker unit. In the first quarter the MAYA 2-1-1 industry benchmark crack spread decreased to an average of $17.21 per barrel for the quarter. Unplanned maintenance at our Houston Refinery reduced the average crude throughput by over 40,000 barrels per day to 226,000 barrels per day for the quarter. The refining market has been challenged by falling prices and demand for transportation fuels, including gasoline and jet fuel. We anticipate that these factors will continue to pressure our refining results, until societal restrictions ease and demand for transportation fuels returns to typical levels later in the year. Our fluid catalytic cracker unit at the refinery returned to service in late April and we are currently operating the refinery at 85% to 90% of nameplate crude throughput. Please turn to slide 21, as we review the results of our Technology segment. During the first quarter, Technology segment EBITDA was $56 million, a decrease of $82 million compared to the record results from the fourth quarter of 2019. Catalyst volumes and margins remained steady, while licensing revenue declined due to fewer revenue milestones during the quarter. Our Technology segment licenses polymer production technologies for new manufacturing plants that enable subsequent catalyst sales to licensing customers over the lifetime of the asset. Individual contract terms and the timing of project milestones results in an uneven pace for licensing revenues. Based on the anticipated timing of upcoming milestones, we expect that second quarter licensing profitability will return to the higher levels of recent quarters. Let me summarize this quarter's highlights and outlook with slide 22. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's leading and advantaged assets continued to deliver resilient results. Our foundations in leveraging our feedstock flexibility, with our low operating costs and high asset utilization serves us well during any point in the cycle. We remain consistent with our capital deployment strategy that supports our dividend with efficient cash generation and disciplined allocation of capital expenditures for required maintenance and profit-generating growth projects. All decisions are grounded by our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. We anticipate that challenges from the coronavirus pandemic and plummeting oil prices that arose during the first quarter will extend for much of the year. Demand and margins for transportation fuels will eventually rebound as various regions emerge from societal restrictions return to work and regain comfort with prior travel patterns. Markets for discretionary durable goods will likely take longer to recover from the downturn. We expect that robust consumer-driven demand for our products in packaging and medical applications will continue. LyondellBasell is addressing these challenges by proactively reducing costs working capital and capital expenditures, while prioritizing and increasing liquidity. Our company is really well positioned to navigate these challenging markets and emerge stronger with the eventual rebound of the global economy. We will now please take your questions. Yeah, John. Good morning. The way we think about it is we have packaging and medical which is probably nearly half of the company essentially; and then durable goods auto is probably about 20%, 25%; and then the fuels and oxyfuels and so on is the remainder. I think that, we should see demand improve even further, if the economies are opened, because typically in the summertime as you know we see seasonal effects and we see increases in demand. So relatively speaking, we could see more of that on the packaging side. And on fuels you said it rightly that as people get on the road and drive more our oxyfuels and refining business should improve. So kind of the way we're thinking about it is automobile production and demand will probably be the slowest to return. But it's a pretty small part of our business. Yeah. Good morning, Steve. Indeed, if it was running, we'd have decent margins probably in the $400 to $500 per ton integrated basis range. You'll recall that, the thesis around that investment is about producing in China for China and the benefit of that project for us beyond getting a bigger position in China is that the timing of the investment will be such that when we make our capital infusion, it will be very close to start-up so within a quarter or two. But decent margins today, if it was running. Hey, good morning, David. Yeah, David. I think even the $0.04, I would say it's \u2013 that may be more of a headline number as opposed to kind of realized when you look through all of the different end-use segments that we supply. In terms of the outlook with ethane price rising like it has, difficult to imagine that you'd have that, kind of, a large step down. And again as I mentioned earlier, on the demand side, packaging related demand is still very good. We're coming into the summer season. And as different state economies in the U.S. start to open and outdoor activities actually are safer than indoor activities and that drives packaging demand. So if we see some increase in demand seasonally, it seems to me that we have a decent market environment. And in our case, we're running our assets in olefins and polyolefins in the U.S. at about 70% today. So pretty decent rate given the environment we're in. Yeah. So Vincent in terms of ethane supply/demand, we're all working to get our arms around what could happen. But here's the way I think about it. First of all, there's quite a bit that's being rejected today, maybe as much as 350,000 barrels a day of ethane being rejected. So, of course, that rejection would get shut off. And then in times past what we've seen is, if ethane is still snug and values rise especially in the low oil price environment, you'd see feedstock flexibility kick in. And a company like us, which who have a lot of feedstock flexibility, we would tilt more towards liquids and LPGs. And beyond that, some of the exports could even get shut off for ethane. So it seems to me that what we're really trying to think through is could we have another spike as opposed to a sustained period of high ethane prices. Because in the end, we continue to believe that there's an abundance of ethane available in the U.S. and higher prices will just attract more investment and more supply of ethane over the long-term. So it's more about thinking through transitory effects. And I think a company like ours that has so much feedstock flexibility; we can manage through that probably better than most. Yeah. Arun, it could be that some of the high-cost capacity in Europe or U.S. is idled. But more importantly what we've observed so far is projects are starting to get delayed, excluding China. But elsewhere in the world, if you look up in North America and other parts of the world those are the first signs of change. And frankly we're seeing that even in polyethylene. So one of the outcomes of the period that we're going through is delays in new construction. And I certainly see that in polypropylene. Good morning, P.J. Yeah. Thank you, P.J. Well, inventory reduction has been a very, very high focus for us over the last 75 days or so. We started reducing inventories back in late February and early March. And so today for our polyolefins, we're sitting at 30 days or so of inventory based on lower demand rates. So we've already adjusted for anticipated lower demand rate and we'll continue to do that. And essentially what we're doing is, we're short cycling our product wheel to preferentially produce the products where there's high demand. And only produce to order be in areas where we believe there's low demand or low visibility on demand. And your question about working capital reduction and cash release, we expect about $500 million of cash release from lower working capital as we work our way through this year. Most of that benefit should come through in Q2 with a little bit of tailing benefit in Q3. Hey. Good morning, Kevin. We do see some structural benefits, I think, accruing to both polyethylene and polypropylene for some time given what's happened. Reversal of bag bans on the West Coast on the East Coast those could stay for a while. I think what people are realizing is that there are very significant hygienic benefits to plastics and that single-use has benefits. The key thing that we have to remember that won't change is that the challenge of plastic waste still remains. And I can tell you that we as a company have not lost our focus on that. And I think as an industry the focus on plastic waste, addressing, recycling, increasing capture of waste before it gets in the environment that's something that we should continue our focus on as an industry and we certainly will continue as a company. And then as single-use applications increase in demand, I think, society can be confident that that single-use waste won't end up in the environment. So plastic waste will continue to be an area of emphasis for us. Well so, Aleksey it's probably more about timing during the quarter in terms of the margins. In Europe as the oil price decline, we did see a margin expansion. And that's very typical in Europe. And I think it speaks to again the diversity of our asset base. And in a lower oil price environment we generally see better contribution from our European assets. We likely will see some margin erosion in Europe as we work through Q2 and as things normalize a bit more and the new, sort of, lower oil price environment sets in. We do expect some margin erosion in Europe. But demand is decent in Europe. Frankly, we're running our O&P assets at about 80% in Europe today. And as economies over there open up, we think that going into the summer season we could run at pretty good rates in this 80% to 85% range through the summer. Yes. Hey, good morning. Duffy, actually the byproduct disposition is already playing out. And C4 is -- butadienes containment is a real challenge. And so our strategy is that we don't want to build inventory on butadiene. And so we'll crack liquids up to a point where we can move the butadiene and I think that's already globally been restricting the amount of naphtha that's being cracked. And so we've had -- over the past 10 years, I was thinking about this that we've had probably two or three periods like this where a coproduct disposition became a challenge. Typically, it doesn't last that long. And in the current environment some automobile production coming back and people driving and replacing tires should provide some relief. But, I think, it will continue to be a constraint through most of this year, especially, disposition of butadiene. And again our strategy even in the U.S. where we have significant feedstock flexibility, we will maximize liquids up to a point where we're not building inventory of C4s. Good morning. Yeah. Hey, good morning, Dylan. Let me answer the question in terms of how we're -- the actions we've taken to increase cash flow. So as I mentioned earlier, working capital release we expect to be about $500 million, mostly in Q2 with some trailing benefits in Q3. CapEx, we've reduced on a cash basis by about $500 million from $2.4 billion to $1.9 billion. Most of that $500 million benefit will be evenly spread across Q3 and Q4. In addition to that, we've undertaken -- we've accelerated our cost-reduction initiatives that we started in September of last year. We expect those to provide additional benefit this year on a cash basis of between $150 million and $200 million. So when you kind of total all that up, between the working capital the CapEx and the cash basis cost reduction, we expect that we should boost cash flow this year by about $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, and the timing will start in Q2 through the end of the year. Hey, good morning. Yeah. I mean I think in the near term Mike, we have decent visibility here with Q2 and into Q3. Q4 all of us are keeping an eye on whether we're going to have another wave of the virus or not. And it's an unknown. It's something that's difficult to predict. But if I look beyond the pandemic and look beyond the current period of low oil prices, I mean if history is an indicator, typically oil prices do rebound within 24 months. Now, at the moment we also have a lot of inventory to work through. So, we're not expecting significant improvement in oil price for most of this year. But I do think that if you were to look 24 months out, you could see oil prices at higher levels. Likely, we'll also see project delays and cancellations, and I think -- and some demand improvement, benefit from pent-up demand, which should set up a very good supply/demand environment 24 months out -- 12 to 24 months out. But our focus is to make sure that we maximize cash flow and maximize liquidity in the near term. And make sure that we keep our focus on the long-term projects that we've initiated. Good morning, Frank. Yeah. We don't -- Frank we haven't really seen demand decline to a level where we would consider idling polyethylene capacity. So our sense is that here in April, we're kind of seeing a near-term bottom in demand, because I would imagine that as economies partially reopen directionally that should help on the demand side. And as I was stating earlier on one of the other questions that in a partial lockdown or reduced mobility mode for the rest of the year perhaps, we think that packaging is a beneficiary of that. So our expectation is that in the U.S., we're going to run kind of 70%, 80% across our assets. And olefins and polyolefins in Europe 80%, 85%, and we don't really foresee needing to idle for a long period of time in the polyethylene. Yes. Thank you for that question Jeff. Well in the near term, as I mentioned, given lack of visibility in terms of the outlook beyond Q3, really our priorities are to maximize liquidity. In terms of capital allocation, we're very consistent in our view that the dividend is a high priority for us coupled with a strong BBB or investment-grade rating, which today is BBB for us. So I don't expect that we would undertake buybacks given that we're prioritizing liquidity. Our dividend we expect that we will recommend the May dividend to our Board. We expect that they'll approve that dividend for Q2. Given the visibility that we have and the improvements we've made in terms of working capital CapEx and the cash cost savings, we think that we can largely cover the dividend for the full year. And I think your question we'll be in a better position to answer when we get to later in the year about capital allocation. Today, the priority is maximize liquidity, maximize cash flow and all of those will allow us to continue -- enable us to continue to pay the dividend largely from operating cash flow for the balance of the year. Yes. So in refining Jonas, the light-heavy differential is a very, very significant driver for earnings followed by diesel cracks. Our refinery given that it's a heavy crude oil processing refinery and we make a significant amount of coke as a result, in this environment, it actually favors our refinery because of the amount of diesel that we produce. We've mentioned in prior earnings calls and other venues that we expect that our refinery under more normalized conditions should earn about $100 million in EBITDA per quarter. It will be a challenge to get to that level this year because we still need more supply of sour crude oil. But we do think that the higher level of diesel production as a portion of the total yield favors us in our refinery. In oxyfuels, we should start to see some benefits from the volume rising. Higher oil price also helps in terms of oxyfuel profitability. So both should directionally improve as the lockdowns are eased and as activity at least daily activity returns to more normal levels. Yes. No, we would not be able to do that. And again, butadiene would be probably our greatest challenge today and it's what limits us in terms of how much liquids we can crack. Our capability, we had two crackers at ChannelView that produce about 4 billion pounds of ethylene in total. We can crack all liquids at those two crackers. And in terms of our Corpus Christi cracker, we can crack about two-thirds non-ethane feed. So we have significant flexibility. But today, we could not place all the C4s. And as I said earlier, we do not intend to build inventory. Yeah, good morning, Matthew good to hear from you. They're both resilient for different reasons. In polyethylene, the areas of weakness have been around construction, but we expect that that's more seasonal and that will pick up. In polypropylene, it's more about auto being weak. But on the other hand, it's been offset by the melt-blown-type of products that are going into PPE for first responders and there's quite a bit of packaging in polypropylene. If I really had to call one or the other, I would say maybe on the margin polypropylene is a little bit weaker than polyethylene, just because of the auto content. But both are holding up pretty well. And as I mentioned earlier, we're running our assets at 70% plus here in the U.S. Good morning. Yeah. You know Hassan EBITDA levels, at the kind of levels, you're describing would be extremely low. But I'll invite Michael to comment on the covenants. Okay. Good. Well, thank you for all your questions. I'd like to close with a few comments. As I mentioned earlier we're anticipating and we're ready to address continued challenges as we progress through the current year. Our consistent focus on cash generation disciplined capital allocation will serve us well, in this challenging environment. We're leveraging our leading portfolio, advantaged positions to extend our track record of strong cash generation, profitable growth initiatives and prudent financial policies to deliver sustainable value for you our shareholders.

Following today\u2019s presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 teleconference. I am joined today by Ken Lane, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until February 28 by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13725132. During today\u2019s call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2021 results, the current environment and our near-term outlook. Before turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, that we have discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out, or LIFO, accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized a non-cash impairment of $624 million that reflected our ongoing evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Lane: Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today and as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to take a moment and thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead LyondellBasell as Interim CEO until Peter Vanacker can join the company at the end of the second quarter. For the past 30 years, I have worked in the chemical industry in roles spanning manufacturing, major projects, strategy and business leadership with assignments in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Since 2019, I have had the pleasure of leading LyondellBasell\u2019s global Olefins and Polyolefins businesses. Our company is in great shape and we have good momentum. I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged and I will keep our company moving forward, continuing to execute our strategy and ensuring Peter has a successful start. I will work closely with our Board, the LyondellBasell leadership team and our 19,000 talented employees to advance our growth projects, actively manage our business portfolio, and ensure we remain consistent with our goals of being the best operated and most valued company in our industry. Now moving on to the business discussion, as Dave mentioned, a set of slides accompanies today\u2019s call and is available on our website. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 3 and review some highlights for the past year. 2021 earnings were $18.19 per share, with $9.3 billion of EBITDA. Earnings per share were more than 3x higher than 2020 and EBITDA improved by 140%. Our company\u2019s growing portfolio of assets delivered EBITDA that exceeded our previous best year by 15% and resulted in $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, we generated a 25% return on invested capital during 2021. Our results provide an indicator of how LyondellBasell\u2019s earnings power is stepping up relative to the performance we delivered over the prior decade. Our 2021 performance was supported by strong demand for our products, supply constraints across our industry and our growth investments. Favorable markets drove 7 consecutive months of contract price increases for polyethylene in the United States. In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, strong demand for polyurethanes drove record earnings from our leading propylene oxide and derivatives business. A robust market for building and construction materials served to increase margins across our acetyls value chain. Also, rebounding demand for transportation fuels, self-help cost reductions and higher operating rates enabled our Refining segment to return to profitability in both the third and the fourth quarters. I want to emphasize that we are maintaining our commitment to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our team worked diligently to convert our EBITDA into $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. After investing $1.9 billion to maintain our assets and fund additional profit-generating investments, $5.7 billion of free cash flow remained. We rewarded investors by deploying $4.44 per share in dividends and repurchasing over 5 million shares. Last but not least, we delivered on our commitments and strengthened our balance sheet with $4 billion of long-term debt reduction. Our strategy is to identify, develop and capture opportunities through all phases of business cycles. During 2021, we capitalized on those opportunities. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4. Our core commitments to health and safety remain steadfast. The tragic incident that resulted in two fatalities and several injuries at our acetic acid plant last July reminds us of why we work so diligently toward our goal of flawless safety performance. We learn from experience and seek to further bolster our GoalZERO work environment to prevent these incidents from recurring. On Slide 4, you can see that during 2021, our team continued to deliver recordable incident rates that are among the lowest for industry. I\u2019m particularly proud of our team\u2019s performance over the final months of 2021 as we engaged the entire organization and leadership teams of our largest contractors to reduce recordable incident rates across our employee and contractor workforce each month during the second half of the year. Now please turn to Slide 5 to review our quarterly profitability. While increased costs for feedstocks and energy continue to compress margins from second quarter highs, demand for our products remain strong. Our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, exceeding the results of the prior year quarter by 60%. Increased energy costs were particularly impactful for our European O&P and I&D operations, where on some days in December, Dutch natural gas prices exceeded $50 per million BTU. Higher natural gas prices directly impact our fuel costs, but also show up as higher costs for our purchased electricity and steam. Nonetheless, seasonal patterns for our businesses typically trend downward at the end of the year, and the $2 billion of EBITDA we earned during the fourth quarter of 2021 is reflective of healthy markets for our products. The downward trends we saw in the fourth quarter seem to be abating with margins stabilizing in January. During the remainder of the first quarter, we could see inflection on stronger seasonal demand and supply constraints. With most economists expecting 2022 global GDP growth rates to exceed historical averages at roughly 4%, we remain constructive on the outlook for our businesses. New capacity will come online in 2022 but will largely be needed to meet growing demand from well-funded consumers, address order backlogs as supply chains normalize and support further global reopening from the pandemic. Slide 6 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability over the past decade. During the period from 2011 to 2019, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Our performance in 2021 exceeded the 2015 peak by 15%. While 2021 was a particularly strong year for our core markets, we have confidence that the growth investments we brought online since 2018 will drive a sustainable step-change improvement in our profitability over the next decade. The formation of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in 2018 provided visibility into LyondellBasell\u2019s sizable legacy compounding business. The businesses we acquired that year from A. Schulman added approximately $200 million in annual EBITDA. Since 2018, the APS segment has been challenged by production constraints in their largest market: plastic compounds used in vehicle production. Despite high consumer demand, automotive production has been held back by COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns and shortages of semiconductors. With global vehicle production expected to rebound by 9% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023, we expect to reach higher utilization across our APS segment. Increased capacity utilization will enable the realization of volume-driven synergies. In 2020, we commissioned the first world-scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell\u2019s proprietary Hyperzone technology for high-density polyethylene. We have a long and successful track record of introducing new polyolefin technologies. Each new generation of technology encounters initial challenges, and we are making good progress working through those with our first Hyperzone asset. Our manufacturing and R&D teams have been working diligently to improve reliability. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to bring down the Hyperzone plant and make some modifications. While it\u2019s still early days, we are highly encouraged by the performance of the plant since restarting in December. It\u2019s my expectation that we will realize a greater share of the volume and margin benefits from this investment during 2022. In 2020, we invested and integrated cracker joint ventures in China and Louisiana, where new assets were fully built and generated immediate returns. In 2022, we are starting up 2 new propylene oxide plants, a joint venture in China and a wholly owned asset in Houston that will expand LyondellBasell\u2019s ownership capacity for propylene oxide by nearly 50%. I\u2019m pleased to report that the China plant is already producing on-spec products and rapidly ramping up rates. Our larger PO/TBA facility in Houston is progressing on schedule for start-up during the end of this year. Both propylene oxide facilities are starting up with tight markets and all-time high margins for this intermediate chemical that is essential for the production of polyurethanes and other downstream products. Taken together, our growth investments give us the confidence that we will step up earnings in the current decade. On Slide 7, I would like to highlight how we are also stepping up our progress on sustainability. In April, we introduced our Circulen family of polymers produced using recycled and renewable-based feedstocks that reduce our reliance on fossil-based raw materials. These products are targeted at the rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. In October, we extended the Circulen brand to the compounds and solutions provided by our APS segment. All of this is part of LyondellBasell\u2019s commitment to annually produce and market 2 million tons of recycled and renewable based polymers by 2030. 2022 will be an exciting year for our proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling technology. In December, our team commissioned upgrades to our pilot facility, enabling us to determine the extent of our technology advantage and guide an investment decision for our first commercial-scale facility. This technology provides LyondellBasell with an opportunity to be a leader in the rapidly growing markets for circular plastics. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and the goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. We also increased our 2030 ambition and now aim to reduce absolute emissions by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the near-term, we don\u2019t expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 should offset an increasing share for circular and climate-related investments going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael for him to describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Ken and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 and let me begin by highlighting our substantial cash generation during 2021. LyondellBasell delivered record cash from operations and free cash flow in 2021. Our team worked diligently to efficiently convert 82% of our EBITDA into cash for the year despite increased working capital needs to support higher prices. After accounting for sustaining capital investments, we achieved a 23% free operating cash flow yield relative to our market capitalization. Let\u2019s continue with Slide 9 and review the details of how we deployed all of this cash last year. During 2021, we paid dividends and repurchased shares to provide a total of $2 billion in returns for shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. 2021 represents our 11th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. At the same time, we reduced our long-term debt by $4 billion and further bolstered our balance sheet by paying down $300 million of short-term commercial paper. Net interest expense increased to $510 million, higher than our guidance at the beginning of 2021, largely due to debt extinguishment costs. Our current portfolio supports our solid investment-grade balance sheet, and we do not see the need for additional debt reduction. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.4 billion of cash and available liquidity. Now I\u2019d like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. As Ken mentioned, our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected strong demand for our products, offset by higher costs for feedstocks and energy, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, International, I&D and APS segments. Let\u2019s begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Americas segment. Fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA was $1.3 billion, $306 million lower than the third quarter. Margins declined on lower pricing for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefin results decreased approximately $190 million compared to third quarter 2021 due to margin declines driven by lower ethylene and propylene prices. Although we operated our North American ethylene crackers at 97%, sales volumes remained relatively unchanged as we built inventory to support maintenance downtime planned for the first quarter. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $120 million lower than the third quarter, primarily due to a decrease in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. Polyethylene, however, posted record volumes driven by strong demand and increased production from our Hyperzone facility in December. O&P Americas posted record EBITDA of $5.3 billion for the full year, $3.5 billion higher than 2020. Margins increased for both Olefins and Polyolefins as higher product prices outpaced higher cost. Demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods remained strong and led to increased volumes for both ethylene and polyethylene. Based on increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply due to higher industry cracker maintenance, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 12 and review typical seasonal trends in the U.S. polyethylene market. After tight markets escalated prices over the first three quarters of 2021, declines in polyethylene contract prices during the fourth quarter of last year captured market attention. As illustrated by the green line on the chart, demand typically rises during the first quarter, stabilizes in the second quarter and grows again during the second season of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, orders for polymers slow due to holiday downtime and as market participants strive to minimize their year-end inventories. The blue line indicates that polyethylene pricing logically follows these seasonal demand trends. Simply put, lower fourth quarter prices are a common occurrence. In contrast, the industry usually sees a rebound in demand and pricing during the first quarter. Orders increase as customers resume full production. During February and March, export demand often improves following the Lunar New Year holiday. In 2022, industry consultants are forecasting planned maintenance for U.S. ethylene crackers will be 3x higher than normal, with about 15% of U.S. capacity taking maintenance downtime. Similarly, about 10% of European ethylene capacity will be down for maintenance during the first half of 2022. Ethylene cracker outages often constrain downstream polyethylene production. In summary, the confluence of seasonal trends, industry downtime and robust consumer demand should provide support for polyethylene pricing during the first quarter of 2022. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher cost and lower spreads reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets, resulting in a fourth quarter EBITDA of $155 million, $319 million lower than the third quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $180 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock and energy cost despite higher ethylene and propylene prices. We operate our crackers at a rate of 70% due to planned maintenance. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $100 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. Declining polyolefin spreads and higher energy costs also affected our joint venture equity income by about $15 million. Full year EBITDA increased $923 million compared to 2020. Olefins margins declined due to higher feedstock costs, outpacing increased ethylene and propylene prices. Combined polyolefin results and our joint venture equity income increased by more than $815 million and $125 million, respectively, driven by higher margins with increases in polyolefin prices. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $252 million, a decline of $96 million from the third quarter of 2021. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products and last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $95 million muted margin improvements in our propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemical businesses. Fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results remained relatively unchanged, with higher margins offset by lower volumes due to planned maintenance. Intermediate chemicals results increased about $65 million with the resumption of our acetyls production.  Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased approximately $85 million as margins declined due to higher butane feedstock costs. For the full year, strong demand and a tight market drove margin increases in most businesses, resulting in EBITDA of $1.4 billion, $535 million higher than 2020. Volumes declined due to reduced exports of our propylene oxide and derivative products. In the first quarter of 2022, we expect margins to improve for our Oxyfuels & Related Products business with lower butane feedstock costs. Our volumes are expected to increase during the first quarter, supported by continued strong demand for our propylene oxide and derivatives and acetyls products. Now let\u2019s move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Customer supply chain constraints and high raw material costs hindered results with fourth quarter EBITDA of $24 million, $97 million lower than the third quarter. The segment incurred last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $55 million during the quarter. Results for the Compounding & Solutions businesses decreased due to margin declines driven by higher raw material costs. Volumes decreased with continued supply chain constraints in the automotive manufacturing market. Results for our advanced polymer businesses were relatively unchanged, with margin improvement offset by volume declines. Full year EBITDA for the segment was $409 million, a $28 million increase over 2020. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from a $35 million reduction in integration costs. Margins increased with higher spreads and volumes, increased with higher building and construction demand for our advanced polymer businesses. We expect volumes to improve as automotive manufacturers begin to ramp up production, particularly for products from our Compounding & Solutions business. Now let\u2019s turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $150 million, a $109 million improvement compared to the third quarter of 2021. Results excluded a noncash impairment charge of $624 million, reflecting our ongoing evaluation of strategic options. Results for the quarter benefited from approximately $50 million due to LIFO effects from reduced inventory volumes. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to a better product mix and an increase in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread to about $23.58 per barrel. We operated the refinery at near-full rates of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput at 266,000 barrels per day. Full year EBITDA increased $289 million compared to 2020 or breakeven for the year. Comparisons exclude impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2020. Approximately $45 million of LIFO changes benefited the segment for 2021. Refining margins improved with higher demand for gasoline and jet fuel, which drove the Maya 2-1-1 spread from a historically low point in 2020 at an average of $12.63 to $20.87 per barrel in 2021. Crude throughput improved to 231,000 barrels per day in response to higher market demand. Refining margins are expected to improve slightly, with crack spreads estimated to be about $25 per barrel. We plan to operate the refinery at more than 90% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 17 as we review the results of our Technology segment. All-time high levels of licensing revenue and catalyst volumes drove EBITDA to new records of $173 million for the fourth quarter and $514 million for the full year. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability will be lower, similar to levels in the first quarter of 2021. Before I turn the call over to Ken, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2022 on Slide 18. We are planning to invest approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures during 2022. Approximately $0.9 billion is targeted toward profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of our 2022 growth investment is associated with the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. We have a fairly typical schedule of planned maintenance for 2022 with a total of three major cracker turnarounds. We will also have a couple of turnarounds in our I&D segment during the second quarter. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2022 EBITDA by approximately $265 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. The U.S. cracker turnaround is scheduled for the La Porte, Texas site in the first quarter and expected it to impact O&P America\u2019s quarterly EBITDA by approximately $125 million. The European cracker turnarounds will occur at our French cracker during the first and second quarters and are smaller cracker in Wesseling, Germany during the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The maintenance is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by approximately $25 million, $15 million, $10 million, and $10 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. Plant maintenance at our butanediol facility in one of our two propylene oxide units located in Channelview, Texas is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million. We expect 2022 net interest expense will be approximately $340 million after netting capitalized interest of about $95 million. 2022 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.3 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2022 totaling approximately $70 million with approximately $55 million of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate to be lower than our ETR. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. Ken?\nKen Lane: Thank you, Michael. So let me summarize the year\u2019s highlights and our outlook with Slide 19. In 2021, LyondellBasell maintained our disciplined focus on safety, operational excellence and reliability to maximize returns during a year of exceptional markets. Our 2021 results were 15% above prior benchmarks and are indicative of how LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability is stepping up from prior levels. Many of our growth investments are providing returns today with further contributions expected over the next several years. In 2022, we will expand our propylene oxide capacity by 50% with the start of two new plants in China and Texas. We are improving the performance of our Hyperzone polyethylene technology to deliver enhanced product performance for our customers. As supply chains normalize and automotive production begins to catch up with high consumer demand, we anticipate higher volumes and earnings from our APS segment. Also, improving markets for fuels bodes well for our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses. Our disciplined approach carries through to our capital allocation strategy. We\u2019re providing shareholders with increasing returns from higher dividends and the resumption of share repurchases. In 2021, we de-leveraged our balance sheet and demonstrated our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. With our strong credit metrics, we have no near-term need for further de-leveraging. In 2022, about 40% of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward profit-generating projects, including our new propylene oxide facility in Texas. The rapidly growing market for more sustainable plastics represents one of the greatest opportunities that lies ahead for LyondellBasell. We have launched our Circulen brand, and we\u2019re committed to producing and marketing at least 2 million tons of circular and renewable-based polymers by 2030. At the same time, we will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. At LyondellBasell, we believe our work in sustainability is both good for our planet and good for our business. In summary, we will continue to execute on our disciplined approach and build on the strong momentum to deliver sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. We\u2019re now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nBob Koort: Thank you very much. Ken, I was curious if you could tell us what your expectation is on the profile of cash flow and usage over the next couple of years. I mean it looks like you\u2019ll have 2 or 3 excess free cash after deviate after CapEx. And along those lines, can you give us a sense of what the options and appetite on the Sasol option are?\nKen Lane: Sure, Bob. Thank you for your question. Like I said previously, there is no change to our capital allocation strategy. And what I\u2019ll do is just ask Michael to talk a little bit more about the options going forward, and then maybe I\u2019ll come back and talk about Sasol after that.\nMichael McMurray: Perfect. Good morning, Bob. I mean a couple of things that I\u2019d say. I think first and foremost, I\u2019d say really good execution by the team in 2021 in converting EBITDA into free cash flow. It was a record year of cash generation both from an operating cash perspective, but also from a free cash flow perspective as well. And we also de-levered the balance sheet by $4 billion last year, which I think is pretty impressive. And then on top of that last year, we returned $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. So as we look forward, we\u2019re expecting another year of strong cash generation. The balance sheet is in great shape, so there is no need to do any further de-levering. Our growth investments are paying dividends, which is good news. Working capital this year should be a source of free cash flow. Last year, it consumed a significant amount of free cash flow. And then CapEx is largely flat year-on-year. It\u2019s our expectation with our current outlook that we will responsibly grow the dividend. As you saw in the fourth quarter and also in the third quarter of last year, buybacks are in the mix. So we restarted buybacks in September of \u201821. And when we see value, we will continue to buy our shares. And from an M&A perspective, you can expect that LyondellBasell is going to continue to operate in a very, very disciplined way. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ken to give a few comments about Sasol.\nKen Lane: Yes, Bob. So for Sasol, we\u2019ve commented before that it\u2019s our desire and intent to own the other half of that joint venture. We\u2019re very happy with the partnership. It obviously performed very well in 2021. But of course, there is a buyer and a seller, and our mutual interests are going to have to be aligned in order to be able to come to a conclusion on the transaction. So timing is a little bit hard to predict. But I would still say that it is going to be in the midterm.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. Do you expect your cash balance at the end of the year to be very different from what it is right now? And are cost pressures in your European olefins business in the first quarter greater than what they were in the fourth?\nMichael McMurray: Hi. Good morning, Jeff, I\u2019ll take the first question, and I\u2019ll let Ken take the second one. So we ended the year with about $1.5 billion of cash on sheet. I think you heard me just say in my previous answer that we will grow the dividend responsibly. We will buy our shares when we see value. That said, as we move throughout the year, it\u2019s possible that we could build a little bit of additional cash on sheet.\nKen Lane: And just in terms of the cost pressure in Europe, yes, we saw really an unprecedented spike in energy costs in Europe in the fourth quarter. And we started taking action then to be able to give us a little bit of insulation from that and started to move some surcharges into the market to be able to share some of that burden. So that is going to help us in the first quarter offset some of that. But the cost pressures that we saw in Europe are obviously going to be continuing as you look at the energy prices where they are today. But we\u2019re doing what we can to offset where possible.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Hey, good morning. Just curious on your thoughts on pricing for polyethylene near-term, there are a couple of announcements out there for February, March. And given that there is some capacity or a lot of capacity coming on in 2Q and in North America and the rest of the world, just any thoughts on how you see that unfolding over the year and whether you think that capacity can be absorbed? Thank you.\nKen Lane: Sure. Thank you for the question, Mike. Look, we continue to see strong demand for polymers, and we expect that to continue in 2022. As markets recover from the pandemic, and especially the largest market in China and the supply chain constraints are worked through, we do expect that the market growth is going to be able to absorb a lot of the new capacity that\u2019s coming online. We still expect to see effective operating rates for polyethylene at greater than 90%, and that\u2019s obviously going to be supportive of margins going forward. We did see a downward trend in the prices in the fourth quarter, but we are seeing pricing find a floor. And as we come into the seasonally higher demand of the second quarter, I do expect that there is going to be good support for price increases going forward. We\u2019re already seeing spot pricing increasing pretty much in all regions, which is a good indicator. And remember as well, just going back to volume, December was the second-strongest demand month of 2021, which is pretty unusual when you look at historical demand patterns. With that and the combined impact of all of the downtime that we\u2019re expecting to see on both sides of the Atlantic and the U.S. and Europe, we\u2019re going to see markets continue to be tight, and we expect that to be supportive for pricing going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nBhavesh Lodaya: This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So on the refinery you are competing with a few other refineries looking for a potential transaction. Could you provide an update on the strategic review process or a potential sale of the refinery? And then what would be the next best option if you are not able to do the transaction, because clearly, earnings are pretty strong these days? Thanks.\nKen Lane: Sure, Bhavesh. Thank you for your question. And look as we\u2019ve communicated before, we\u2019re exploring strategic options for this business and we do continue to believe that the asset has a higher value as part of the \u2013 an integrated network. I am sure you can appreciate we\u2019re \u2013 there is really not more that we can say at this time. We\u2019re in the middle of that process as we speak. And with where we are right now, I hope to be able to provide more details of the outcome and in the next few months. But that\u2019s really all that I can say at this point. Michael, I don\u2019t know if you wanted to add anything?\nMichael McMurray: No, I think. Stay tuned.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I guess \u2013 yes, I just wanted to delve in a little bit more on polyethylene and polypropylene. So, on polyethylene, obviously, we have seen some price deterioration the last couple of months. However, there seems to be some feedstock support as you go into Q1 that\u2019s keeping prices up a little bit. Some of your competitors have announced price increases as well. So, do you think that those are more tactics to prevent price erosion, or is there real opportunity to get some price as we move through Q1? And then on polypropylene, it doesn\u2019t necessarily have the same issues with capacity additions that polyethylene faces. So, is there any opportunity for increased pricing in polypropylene, especially if auto production kind of surprise us to the upside? Thanks.\nKen Lane: Hi Arun, thank you for the question. Well, listen, like I had said before, I really do believe that with the robust demand that we are seeing in the markets and the pent-up demand that is still in the market yet to come. We saw in the second half of the year last year the largest market in China weakening in the second half of the year as they were approaching the Olympics and trying to keep the pandemic under control. There is a lot of demand that I believe is still yet to come back, and we are going to see that, I believe sometime in the middle of the year in the spring. And so that is going to be supportive overall. I don\u2019t think that this is related just to feedstock. It really is that demand is strong and supply is tighter than probably most people would expect. For polypropylene, certainly, we are optimistic for polypropylene this year where our portfolio is about 15% or so exposed to automotive. And that market is going to come back this year and that\u2019s also going to be supportive for polypropylene as we move forward in the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question.\nFrank Mitsch: Yes. Good morning and nice to speak with you again Ken. I appreciate the Slide 18 that talks about your planned maintenance impact for 2022 of $265 million. Can you put that into context as to what your plans, and more importantly, what\u2019s your unplanned impacts were in 2021 and to that extent also if you can comment a little bit about the propylene oxide capacity additions? When should we anticipate seeing financial impacts from those capacity additions? Thank you.\nKen Lane: Yes. Frank, good to hear from you as well. Thank you for the question. So look, in 2021, obviously, the biggest impact in terms of unplanned outage was Winter Storm Uri, which we don\u2019t expect that to recur obviously in 2022. So, that had an impact of $400 million to $500 million. So, that was one that is I guess the most material as you would call it. Then we had some other downtime in acetyls as well as at our La Porte olefins cracker. So net-net, that downtime last year was very high relative to history, the unplanned downtime. We certainly don\u2019t expect to see that level of downtime this year. Now if you look at the planned outages, the net impact of the planned outages from \u201821 to \u201822, it\u2019s going to be about a $50 million headwind because we are going to have a little bit higher planned downtime this year.\nMichael McMurray: In the first quarter.\nKen Lane: In the first quarter, yes, sorry.\nDavid Kinney: And I would just add, I would caution \u2013 this is Dave, Frank. I would just caution that you shouldn\u2019t just add back that $400 million because margins really inflated on our downtime. So, that\u2019s why we have been hesitant to try to quantify the unplanned downtime from last year because there is a chicken-and-egg effect between margins and volume.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Parkinson: Great. Thank you very much. So, your team actually appears quite content with the Sasol deal, and I understand we will have to await an outcome on that front. But are there other similar facility and marketing deals your team would be interested in across the globe, perhaps anything else in the U.S. or Asia?\nKen Lane: So look, thank you, Chris, for the question. We have been \u2013 in the last couple of years, we have been implementing several growth projects, including new joint ventures in China and the U.S. We are always looking for opportunities that provide good returns to the company and especially in our core businesses. And we will continue to do that, especially to look for opportunities through the cycle. And right now, there is not anything that I can say specifically. We have talked about the Sasol opportunity, but there is really nothing more that I can comment on at this time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Good morning. I was wondering if you could provide an update on your circular economy initiatives. I think you have a goal of 2 million tons by 2030. How do we get there from here? Maybe you could just talk about what\u2019s going on at QCP and MoReTec and what the decision tree looks like in terms of growth and potential capital needs to fund that growth?\nKen Lane: Sure, Kevin. Thank you for the question. Yes, we have set some ambitious targets for circularity, and it\u2019s our intent to be a leader in the circular plastics space. We do see this market developing rapidly, and it\u2019s an exciting area of growth that fits really well with our capabilities. So, it\u2019s going to be a clear focus for us. Both mechanical and advanced recycling are going to be areas that we are concentrating on as well as renewable products. As you know, we have mentioned previously that we are developing our own technology for advanced recycling called MoReTec. And we expect really to be able to assess the extent of that technology\u2019s advantage here in the next few months. Following that, we will be deciding on an initial commercial investment that should be completed around the middle of the decade. At the same time, we are looking at other paths to be able to reach that volume target. And we will be doing things like buying recycled and renewable feedstocks that we can track in our existing assets. And that of course, requires little or really no capital investment. So, all of these things are going to be levers that we are going to be pulling, working very closely with our customers and innovating with them on applications that we can roll out over time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDuffy Fischer: Okay. Good morning guys. Three questions around the PO plants coming up. So, first is just technically, is there any reason to think we may have issues with the ramp up of this, let\u2019s say, like Hyperzone, or is this an older technology that you feel more comfortable about the ramp up? Two, what will the ramp up look like? I mean when you look at the market today, how long will it take to get those plants or at least the products from those plants mostly sold out? And then the third one is, just given the market you see today, is the EBITDA contribution from these plants similar to what was expected historically?\nKen Lane: Thank you for the question, Duffy. Look, the technology that we are building, the PO/TBA technology that we are building, is the most competitive in the world. So, I do want to just make sure we point that out. We are very confident in the technology. It\u2019s a technology that we operate today. It\u2019s a very large and complex plant, as you can imagine. So, I am not going to say that there is no risk. But from a technology standpoint, I really don\u2019t see a risk. Then to your question just around the ramp up, we will be ramping up beginning next year. And we see very good demand, and our teams are making very good progress on contracting the volume from that asset. I can tell you as well for the plant in China, the markets are very good there. And the growth in polyurethane is going to be able to absorb this new capacity that we are bringing on stream. In terms of the EBITDA impact, I would say, yes, for modeling purposes, you should be expecting the EBITDA contribution to be similar to what we have seen in the past.\nDavid Kinney: And Duffy, just for numbers, this is our sixth PO/TBA plant that we have built. So, good experience with it, definitely not number one.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks. Was the Technology segment just timing or has something happened there that shift the historical range up? So, when it drops off, your guidance is for it to come back down. But does it come back down within the normal range, or has the range moved up here as well?\nKen Lane: Yes. Thank you for your question, John. Michael, do you want to comment on that?\nMichael McMurray: Sure. Hi John. So listen, the technology business had a great year overall. So, record EBITDA, all-time high licensing revenue and catalyst volumes, primarily driven by Asia. You are right. So, Q4 did exceed even our expectations. There were a number of licenses that we are expecting to book in the first quarter that got done in the fourth quarter. So, you shouldn\u2019t expect that trend to continue. And it\u2019s kind of our expectation that the first quarter of this year should look a lot like the first quarter of last year. But it is a great business. It\u2019s kind of like a razor-blade business, right. So, you sell licenses and then you continue to sell catalysts for a long, long time at great profits.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nHassan Ahmed: Good morning Ken. I wanted to revisit near-term sort of pricing dynamics in polyethylene. Just want to get a bit more granular. Look I mean we know for Q1, roughly, call it, around $0.08 a pound worth of price hikes on the table. And you guys sort of pointed out that around 15% of U.S. capacity is undergoing maintenance in Q1. So obviously, that\u2019s supportive. My question really is that, I mean with roughly 8 million tons of polyethylene capacity expected to come online this year, I mean could there be a situation where it\u2019s a strong first half and then we sort of go down a cliff in the back half of the year in terms of pricing? And just paring that with the demand side, look, I mean if all of that 8 million tons of capacity comes online this year, for demand to keep pace with that, global demand growth would need to be north of 7%. So, are you guys sort of \u2013 as you talk about demand strength, are you looking for demand growth at those elevated levels?\nKen Lane: Good morning Hassan. Thanks again for the question. Listen, if you look historically, years following when we have not seen good global growth, especially coming out of a year like we did with 2020, you can see double-digit growth rates even in China. And those types of growth years do typically occur once we see a snapback. And they are hard to predict, but they have occurred in the past. So, you can never bank on that. But my expectation is that the 8 million tons, there will be a combination of things that you see. All of the capacity is not going to be coming online exactly as we expect. Everybody understands that there are some constraints in China around that, especially with the dual control limitations. But the demand is going to come back and we have seen that in the past. So, a combination of some slower ramp-up of the capacity coming on, stronger demand, I certainly don\u2019t see a cliff in the second half of the year. I see it completely the opposite to that right now, but that\u2019s our view going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: Hey. Good morning Ken. Just a couple of questions. First on \u2013 there have been some news that comonomer availability like hexane has been in short supply. Is that impacting production for the industry and for you? And when do you think you will normalize that? And then I think last quarter, you guys had talked about reducing your Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 30% by 2030. How much capital spending do you think you need to have in order to achieve that? Thank you.\nKen Lane: Thank you, P.J. Good morning. Yes, so there is a shortage of hexane in the market. And that combined with downtime at some of the linear low plants both in the U.S. and in Europe, has tightened that market pretty significantly. Now I will tell you that we are not having any constraints on hexane with our linear low business. So, that\u2019s good news. But for the industry, yes, there is tightness in that market, and I expect that that\u2019s going to continue in the short-term. Now going back to your question around our targets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 reductions that we have announced, in the next few years, we will be able to accommodate all of the things that we are looking at with our $2 billion capital spending. Our focus really in the next few years is going to be capturing the low-hanging fruit, really to make the first significant steps in the process of ramping up to the target in 2030. And that\u2019s going to include things like improved energy efficiency and some emission-reduction programs at our sites that really require little or no investment. Another low-capital enabler for our carbon-reduction targets is also going to be the increased utilization of renewable energy. So, we expect that within the next few years, the amount of capital that we have guided to, the $2 billion is going to be adequate for us to be able to get started on meeting these commitments. And then we will be identifying projects and developing detailed plans to achieve the full target in the second half of the decade. And that\u2019s likely to result in some increased capital, but we will have more to communicate on that later.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Ken and Michael, can you just discuss oxyfuels? How \u2013 what was the earnings decline in 2021 and what you are expecting for ramp-up, a return back to some higher normal high levels of profitability in 2022?\nKen Lane: Sure, David. I will start and then I will hand it over to Michael, let him comment a little bit. Oxyfuels, we had \u2013 especially in the fourth quarter, we had lower volumes, we had significantly lower volumes and margin challenges with butane feedstock prices running up. We are seeing that improving coming into the first quarter. So, we will see the volumes coming back and some relief with the butane feedstock pricing. Michael, I don\u2019t know if you want to add something to that.\nMichael McMurray: No. I mean maybe just a couple of other comments around the I&D business for the quarter and around oxyfuels. So, don\u2019t forget in the quarter itself, there was a $95 million LIFO charge, which obviously will not be there in the first quarter of this year. And then maybe to put some numbers around kind of the feedstock drag in the quarter within oxyfuels, it was about $85 million. So, it was pretty significant related to butane. And as Ken said, butane prices have already started to ease off. And it\u2019s our expectation as we move through the year that, that\u2019s going to continue. And then maybe one other thing I would just point out about this business. I mean this business is kind of the comonomer or kind of mail person of chemical businesses. It has a long track record, if you look back over the last decade, of earning kind of $400 million-plus EBITDA. So, go back and look over the last 10 years, we are confident it\u2019s going to get back to its historic earning power.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello. Hi. This is Sean on for Steve. So, in the last few weeks, you have seen a real run-up in Brent prices and also on nat gas. So, I was just wondering what are your views on the possible tailwind we might see a re-widening of the oil-gas ratio, if we see a supply response on the nat gas side?\nKen Lane: Sure. Hi Sean. We definitely see going forward the oil-to-gas ratio being favorable for our position in the U.S. markets. The high oil prices is certainly going to continue to pressure margins in Asia and Europe. But overall, net-net, we are expecting to see a continued favorable oil to gas ratio.\nDavid Kinney: Yes. In Asia, it\u2019s really tight, Sean. I mean the spread between naphtha and polyethylene is like $200, $300 per ton. That\u2019s a historic lows. It just can\u2019t stay there. So, oil is going to pressure polyethylene prices upwards in Asia, and that\u2019s good for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Blair: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe sticking on feedstocks, do you have any thoughts on overall ethane availability? We have seen the ethane premium to natural gas move out to about $0.10. I think last year, it was closer to $0.05. And maybe that\u2019s a function of some new plants starting up. But what\u2019s your outlook on this going forward?\nKen Lane: Good morning Matthew. Thanks for your question. Well, listen, ethane inventories are still healthy and production is improving, especially in the Permian and the Bakken. So, even with the new crackers coming online, there is still excess ethane that\u2019s being rejected. And as production recovers and natural gas prices normalize, I do expect that ethane is going to remain the preferred feedstock. I will just add, too, that ethane rejection has only decreased slightly and still is about 800,000 barrels a day. And with the recovery having increased, there is really plenty of supply available.\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing that there are no further questions. I will turn it back to Mr. Lane for closing comments.\nKen Lane: Okay. So listen, thank you again for all the thoughtful questions. Just before we close, I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged. We have got great momentum, and we are going to continue focusing on safety, operational excellence as well as our disciplined approach to capital allocation. So, thank you very much for your interest in LyondellBasell. And we look forward to updating you on the progress at the end of April. Have a great weekend and stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 and let me begin by highlighting our substantial cash generation during 2021. LyondellBasell delivered record cash from operations and free cash flow in 2021. Our team worked diligently to efficiently convert 82% of our EBITDA into cash for the year despite increased working capital needs to support higher prices. After accounting for sustaining capital investments, we achieved a 23% free operating cash flow yield relative to our market capitalization. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of how we deployed all of this cash last year. During 2021, we paid dividends and repurchased shares to provide a total of $2 billion in returns for shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 8%. 2021 represents our 11th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. At the same time, we reduced our long-term debt by $4 billion and further bolstered our balance sheet by paying down $300 million of short-term commercial paper. Net interest expense increased to $510 million, higher than our guidance at the beginning of 2021, largely due to debt extinguishment costs. Our current portfolio supports our solid investment-grade balance sheet, and we do not see the need for additional debt reduction. We ended the year with $1.5 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.4 billion of cash and available liquidity. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. As Ken mentioned, our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected strong demand for our products, offset by higher costs for feedstocks and energy, primarily in our O&P Europe, Asia, International, I&D and APS segments. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Americas segment. Fourth quarter 2021 EBITDA was $1.3 billion, $306 million lower than the third quarter. Margins declined on lower pricing for both Olefins and Polyolefins. Olefin results decreased approximately $190 million compared to third quarter 2021 due to margin declines driven by lower ethylene and propylene prices. Although we operated our North American ethylene crackers at 97%, sales volumes remained relatively unchanged as we built inventory to support maintenance downtime planned for the first quarter. Combined polyolefin results were approximately $120 million lower than the third quarter, primarily due to a decrease in polyethylene and polypropylene spreads over monomer. Polyethylene, however, posted record volumes driven by strong demand and increased production from our Hyperzone facility in December. O&P Americas posted record EBITDA of $5.3 billion for the full year, $3.5 billion higher than 2020. Margins increased for both Olefins and Polyolefins as higher product prices outpaced higher cost. Demand for nondurable packaging and consumer goods remained strong and led to increased volumes for both ethylene and polyethylene. Based on increasing seasonal demand and tight industry supply due to higher industry cracker maintenance, we expect robust margins to continue into the first quarter. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review typical seasonal trends in the U.S. polyethylene market. After tight markets escalated prices over the first three quarters of 2021, declines in polyethylene contract prices during the fourth quarter of last year captured market attention. As illustrated by the green line on the chart, demand typically rises during the first quarter, stabilizes in the second quarter and grows again during the second season of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, orders for polymers slow due to holiday downtime and as market participants strive to minimize their year-end inventories. The blue line indicates that polyethylene pricing logically follows these seasonal demand trends. Simply put, lower fourth quarter prices are a common occurrence. In contrast, the industry usually sees a rebound in demand and pricing during the first quarter. Orders increase as customers resume full production. During February and March, export demand often improves following the Lunar New Year holiday. In 2022, industry consultants are forecasting planned maintenance for U.S. ethylene crackers will be 3x higher than normal, with about 15% of U.S. capacity taking maintenance downtime. Similarly, about 10% of European ethylene capacity will be down for maintenance during the first half of 2022. Ethylene cracker outages often constrain downstream polyethylene production. In summary, the confluence of seasonal trends, industry downtime and robust consumer demand should provide support for polyethylene pricing during the first quarter of 2022. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher cost and lower spreads reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets, resulting in a fourth quarter EBITDA of $155 million, $319 million lower than the third quarter. Olefins results declined approximately $180 million as margins decreased driven by higher feedstock and energy cost despite higher ethylene and propylene prices. We operate our crackers at a rate of 70% due to planned maintenance. Combined polyolefin results decreased approximately $100 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal demand drove declines in polyolefin price spreads relative to monomer cost and reduced volumes. Declining polyolefin spreads and higher energy costs also affected our joint venture equity income by about $15 million. Full year EBITDA increased $923 million compared to 2020. Olefins margins declined due to higher feedstock costs, outpacing increased ethylene and propylene prices. Combined polyolefin results and our joint venture equity income increased by more than $815 million and $125 million, respectively, driven by higher margins with increases in polyolefin prices. In Europe, we expect typical seasonal improvements as we progress through the first half of the year. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $252 million, a decline of $96 million from the third quarter of 2021. Compressed margins for Oxyfuels & Related Products and last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $95 million muted margin improvements in our propylene oxide and derivatives and intermediate chemical businesses. Fourth quarter propylene oxide and derivatives results remained relatively unchanged, with higher margins offset by lower volumes due to planned maintenance. Intermediate chemicals results increased about $65 million with the resumption of our acetyls production.  Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased approximately $85 million as margins declined due to higher butane feedstock costs. For the full year, strong demand and a tight market drove margin increases in most businesses, resulting in EBITDA of $1.4 billion, $535 million higher than 2020. Volumes declined due to reduced exports of our propylene oxide and derivative products. In the first quarter of 2022, we expect margins to improve for our Oxyfuels & Related Products business with lower butane feedstock costs. Our volumes are expected to increase during the first quarter, supported by continued strong demand for our propylene oxide and derivatives and acetyls products. Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. Customer supply chain constraints and high raw material costs hindered results with fourth quarter EBITDA of $24 million, $97 million lower than the third quarter. The segment incurred last in, first out inventory valuation charges of about $55 million during the quarter. Results for the Compounding & Solutions businesses decreased due to margin declines driven by higher raw material costs. Volumes decreased with continued supply chain constraints in the automotive manufacturing market. Results for our advanced polymer businesses were relatively unchanged, with margin improvement offset by volume declines. Full year EBITDA for the segment was $409 million, a $28 million increase over 2020. Compared to the prior period, results benefited from a $35 million reduction in integration costs. Margins increased with higher spreads and volumes, increased with higher building and construction demand for our advanced polymer businesses. We expect volumes to improve as automotive manufacturers begin to ramp up production, particularly for products from our Compounding & Solutions business. Now let's turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $150 million, a $109 million improvement compared to the third quarter of 2021. Results excluded a noncash impairment charge of $624 million, reflecting our ongoing evaluation of strategic options. Results for the quarter benefited from approximately $50 million due to LIFO effects from reduced inventory volumes. Results for the fourth quarter were driven by an improvement in margins due to a better product mix and an increase in the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark crack spread to about $23.58 per barrel. We operated the refinery at near-full rates of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput at 266,000 barrels per day. Full year EBITDA increased $289 million compared to 2020 or breakeven for the year. Comparisons exclude impairments taken in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the third quarter of 2020. Approximately $45 million of LIFO changes benefited the segment for 2021. Refining margins improved with higher demand for gasoline and jet fuel, which drove the Maya 2-1-1 spread from a historically low point in 2020 at an average of $12.63 to $20.87 per barrel in 2021. Crude throughput improved to 231,000 barrels per day in response to higher market demand. Refining margins are expected to improve slightly, with crack spreads estimated to be about $25 per barrel. We plan to operate the refinery at more than 90% of nameplate crude capacity during the first quarter. Please turn to Slide 17 as we review the results of our Technology segment. All-time high levels of licensing revenue and catalyst volumes drove EBITDA to new records of $173 million for the fourth quarter and $514 million for the full year. Based on the timing of anticipated licensing milestones, we expect the first quarter Technology business profitability will be lower, similar to levels in the first quarter of 2021. Before I turn the call over to Ken, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2022 on Slide 18. We are planning to invest approximately $2.1 billion in capital expenditures during 2022. Approximately $0.9 billion is targeted toward profit-generating growth projects, with the balance supporting sustaining maintenance. The majority of our 2022 growth investment is associated with the construction of the PO/TBA plant in Houston. We have a fairly typical schedule of planned maintenance for 2022 with a total of three major cracker turnarounds. We will also have a couple of turnarounds in our I&D segment during the second quarter. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2022 EBITDA by approximately $265 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. The U.S. cracker turnaround is scheduled for the La Porte, Texas site in the first quarter and expected it to impact O&P America's quarterly EBITDA by approximately $125 million. The European cracker turnarounds will occur at our French cracker during the first and second quarters and are smaller cracker in Wesseling, Germany during the third and fourth quarters of 2022. The maintenance is expected to impact O&P EAI quarterly EBITDA by approximately $25 million, $15 million, $10 million, and $10 million in the first through fourth quarters, respectively. Plant maintenance at our butanediol facility in one of our two propylene oxide units located in Channelview, Texas is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million. We expect 2022 net interest expense will be approximately $340 million after netting capitalized interest of about $95 million. 2022 book depreciation and amortization is forecasted to be approximately $1.3 billion. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2022 totaling approximately $70 million with approximately $55 million of pension expense for the year. We currently expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate to be lower than our ETR. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken. Ken? Perfect. Good morning, Bob. I mean a couple of things that I'd say. I think first and foremost, I'd say really good execution by the team in 2021 in converting EBITDA into free cash flow. It was a record year of cash generation both from an operating cash perspective, but also from a free cash flow perspective as well. And we also de-levered the balance sheet by $4 billion last year, which I think is pretty impressive. And then on top of that last year, we returned $2 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. So as we look forward, we're expecting another year of strong cash generation. The balance sheet is in great shape, so there is no need to do any further de-levering. Our growth investments are paying dividends, which is good news. Working capital this year should be a source of free cash flow. Last year, it consumed a significant amount of free cash flow. And then CapEx is largely flat year-on-year. It's our expectation with our current outlook that we will responsibly grow the dividend. As you saw in the fourth quarter and also in the third quarter of last year, buybacks are in the mix. So we restarted buybacks in September of \u201821. And when we see value, we will continue to buy our shares. And from an M&A perspective, you can expect that LyondellBasell is going to continue to operate in a very, very disciplined way. And with that, I'll turn it back to Ken to give a few comments about Sasol. Hi. Good morning, Jeff, I'll take the first question, and I'll let Ken take the second one. So we ended the year with about $1.5 billion of cash on sheet. I think you heard me just say in my previous answer that we will grow the dividend responsibly. We will buy our shares when we see value. That said, as we move throughout the year, it's possible that we could build a little bit of additional cash on sheet. No, I think. Stay tuned. In the first quarter. Sure. Hi John. So listen, the technology business had a great year overall. So, record EBITDA, all-time high licensing revenue and catalyst volumes, primarily driven by Asia. You are right. So, Q4 did exceed even our expectations. There were a number of licenses that we are expecting to book in the first quarter that got done in the fourth quarter. So, you shouldn't expect that trend to continue. And it's kind of our expectation that the first quarter of this year should look a lot like the first quarter of last year. But it is a great business. It's kind of like a razor-blade business, right. So, you sell licenses and then you continue to sell catalysts for a long, long time at great profits. No. I mean maybe just a couple of other comments around the I&D business for the quarter and around oxyfuels. So, don't forget in the quarter itself, there was a $95 million LIFO charge, which obviously will not be there in the first quarter of this year. And then maybe to put some numbers around kind of the feedstock drag in the quarter within oxyfuels, it was about $85 million. So, it was pretty significant related to butane. And as Ken said, butane prices have already started to ease off. And it's our expectation as we move through the year that, that's going to continue. And then maybe one other thing I would just point out about this business. I mean this business is kind of the comonomer or kind of mail person of chemical businesses. It has a long track record, if you look back over the last decade, of earning kind of $400 million-plus EBITDA. So, go back and look over the last 10 years, we are confident it's going to get back to its historic earning power."

            "name": "Ken Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today and as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to take a moment and thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead LyondellBasell as Interim CEO until Peter Vanacker can join the company at the end of the second quarter. For the past 30 years, I have worked in the chemical industry in roles spanning manufacturing, major projects, strategy and business leadership with assignments in Asia, Europe and the Americas. Since 2019, I have had the pleasure of leading LyondellBasell's global Olefins and Polyolefins businesses. Our company is in great shape and we have good momentum. I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged and I will keep our company moving forward, continuing to execute our strategy and ensuring Peter has a successful start. I will work closely with our Board, the LyondellBasell leadership team and our 19,000 talented employees to advance our growth projects, actively manage our business portfolio, and ensure we remain consistent with our goals of being the best operated and most valued company in our industry. Now moving on to the business discussion, as Dave mentioned, a set of slides accompanies today's call and is available on our website. Let's turn to Slide 3 and review some highlights for the past year. 2021 earnings were $18.19 per share, with $9.3 billion of EBITDA. Earnings per share were more than 3x higher than 2020 and EBITDA improved by 140%. Our company's growing portfolio of assets delivered EBITDA that exceeded our previous best year by 15% and resulted in $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, we generated a 25% return on invested capital during 2021. Our results provide an indicator of how LyondellBasell's earnings power is stepping up relative to the performance we delivered over the prior decade. Our 2021 performance was supported by strong demand for our products, supply constraints across our industry and our growth investments. Favorable markets drove 7 consecutive months of contract price increases for polyethylene in the United States. In our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, strong demand for polyurethanes drove record earnings from our leading propylene oxide and derivatives business. A robust market for building and construction materials served to increase margins across our acetyls value chain. Also, rebounding demand for transportation fuels, self-help cost reductions and higher operating rates enabled our Refining segment to return to profitability in both the third and the fourth quarters. I want to emphasize that we are maintaining our commitment to a disciplined approach to capital allocation. Our team worked diligently to convert our EBITDA into $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities. After investing $1.9 billion to maintain our assets and fund additional profit-generating investments, $5.7 billion of free cash flow remained. We rewarded investors by deploying $4.44 per share in dividends and repurchasing over 5 million shares. Last but not least, we delivered on our commitments and strengthened our balance sheet with $4 billion of long-term debt reduction. Our strategy is to identify, develop and capture opportunities through all phases of business cycles. During 2021, we capitalized on those opportunities. Let's turn to Slide 4. Our core commitments to health and safety remain steadfast. The tragic incident that resulted in two fatalities and several injuries at our acetic acid plant last July reminds us of why we work so diligently toward our goal of flawless safety performance. We learn from experience and seek to further bolster our GoalZERO work environment to prevent these incidents from recurring. On Slide 4, you can see that during 2021, our team continued to deliver recordable incident rates that are among the lowest for industry. I'm particularly proud of our team's performance over the final months of 2021 as we engaged the entire organization and leadership teams of our largest contractors to reduce recordable incident rates across our employee and contractor workforce each month during the second half of the year. Now please turn to Slide 5 to review our quarterly profitability. While increased costs for feedstocks and energy continue to compress margins from second quarter highs, demand for our products remain strong. Our business portfolio delivered $2 billion of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, exceeding the results of the prior year quarter by 60%. Increased energy costs were particularly impactful for our European O&P and I&D operations, where on some days in December, Dutch natural gas prices exceeded $50 per million BTU. Higher natural gas prices directly impact our fuel costs, but also show up as higher costs for our purchased electricity and steam. Nonetheless, seasonal patterns for our businesses typically trend downward at the end of the year, and the $2 billion of EBITDA we earned during the fourth quarter of 2021 is reflective of healthy markets for our products. The downward trends we saw in the fourth quarter seem to be abating with margins stabilizing in January. During the remainder of the first quarter, we could see inflection on stronger seasonal demand and supply constraints. With most economists expecting 2022 global GDP growth rates to exceed historical averages at roughly 4%, we remain constructive on the outlook for our businesses. New capacity will come online in 2022 but will largely be needed to meet growing demand from well-funded consumers, address order backlogs as supply chains normalize and support further global reopening from the pandemic. Slide 6 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell's profitability over the past decade. During the period from 2011 to 2019, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Our performance in 2021 exceeded the 2015 peak by 15%. While 2021 was a particularly strong year for our core markets, we have confidence that the growth investments we brought online since 2018 will drive a sustainable step-change improvement in our profitability over the next decade. The formation of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment in 2018 provided visibility into LyondellBasell's sizable legacy compounding business. The businesses we acquired that year from A. Schulman added approximately $200 million in annual EBITDA. Since 2018, the APS segment has been challenged by production constraints in their largest market: plastic compounds used in vehicle production. Despite high consumer demand, automotive production has been held back by COVID-related manufacturing shutdowns and shortages of semiconductors. With global vehicle production expected to rebound by 9% in 2022 and an additional 10% in 2023, we expect to reach higher utilization across our APS segment. Increased capacity utilization will enable the realization of volume-driven synergies. In 2020, we commissioned the first world-scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell's proprietary Hyperzone technology for high-density polyethylene. We have a long and successful track record of introducing new polyolefin technologies. Each new generation of technology encounters initial challenges, and we are making good progress working through those with our first Hyperzone asset. Our manufacturing and R&D teams have been working diligently to improve reliability. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we decided to bring down the Hyperzone plant and make some modifications. While it's still early days, we are highly encouraged by the performance of the plant since restarting in December. It's my expectation that we will realize a greater share of the volume and margin benefits from this investment during 2022. In 2020, we invested and integrated cracker joint ventures in China and Louisiana, where new assets were fully built and generated immediate returns. In 2022, we are starting up 2 new propylene oxide plants, a joint venture in China and a wholly owned asset in Houston that will expand LyondellBasell's ownership capacity for propylene oxide by nearly 50%. I'm pleased to report that the China plant is already producing on-spec products and rapidly ramping up rates. Our larger PO/TBA facility in Houston is progressing on schedule for start-up during the end of this year. Both propylene oxide facilities are starting up with tight markets and all-time high margins for this intermediate chemical that is essential for the production of polyurethanes and other downstream products. Taken together, our growth investments give us the confidence that we will step up earnings in the current decade. On Slide 7, I would like to highlight how we are also stepping up our progress on sustainability. In April, we introduced our Circulen family of polymers produced using recycled and renewable-based feedstocks that reduce our reliance on fossil-based raw materials. These products are targeted at the rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. In October, we extended the Circulen brand to the compounds and solutions provided by our APS segment. All of this is part of LyondellBasell's commitment to annually produce and market 2 million tons of recycled and renewable based polymers by 2030. 2022 will be an exciting year for our proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling technology. In December, our team commissioned upgrades to our pilot facility, enabling us to determine the extent of our technology advantage and guide an investment decision for our first commercial-scale facility. This technology provides LyondellBasell with an opportunity to be a leader in the rapidly growing markets for circular plastics. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and the goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. We also increased our 2030 ambition and now aim to reduce absolute emissions by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the near-term, we don't expect significant increases in our overall capital budget as reduced spending associated with the completion of our PO/TBA project in 2022 should offset an increasing share for circular and climate-related investments going forward. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael for him to describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Michael. So let me summarize the year's highlights and our outlook with Slide 19. In 2021, LyondellBasell maintained our disciplined focus on safety, operational excellence and reliability to maximize returns during a year of exceptional markets. Our 2021 results were 15% above prior benchmarks and are indicative of how LyondellBasell's profitability is stepping up from prior levels. Many of our growth investments are providing returns today with further contributions expected over the next several years. In 2022, we will expand our propylene oxide capacity by 50% with the start of two new plants in China and Texas. We are improving the performance of our Hyperzone polyethylene technology to deliver enhanced product performance for our customers. As supply chains normalize and automotive production begins to catch up with high consumer demand, we anticipate higher volumes and earnings from our APS segment. Also, improving markets for fuels bodes well for our Oxyfuels and Refining businesses. Our disciplined approach carries through to our capital allocation strategy. We're providing shareholders with increasing returns from higher dividends and the resumption of share repurchases. In 2021, we de-leveraged our balance sheet and demonstrated our commitment to a strong investment-grade credit rating. With our strong credit metrics, we have no near-term need for further de-leveraging. In 2022, about 40% of our capital expenditures will be allocated toward profit-generating projects, including our new propylene oxide facility in Texas. The rapidly growing market for more sustainable plastics represents one of the greatest opportunities that lies ahead for LyondellBasell. We have launched our Circulen brand, and we're committed to producing and marketing at least 2 million tons of circular and renewable-based polymers by 2030. At the same time, we will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in line with our commitment to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2050. At LyondellBasell, we believe our work in sustainability is both good for our planet and good for our business. In summary, we will continue to execute on our disciplined approach and build on the strong momentum to deliver sustainable value for all of our stakeholders. We're now pleased to take your questions. Sure, Bob. Thank you for your question. Like I said previously, there is no change to our capital allocation strategy. And what I'll do is just ask Michael to talk a little bit more about the options going forward, and then maybe I'll come back and talk about Sasol after that. Yes, Bob. So for Sasol, we've commented before that it's our desire and intent to own the other half of that joint venture. We're very happy with the partnership. It obviously performed very well in 2021. But of course, there is a buyer and a seller, and our mutual interests are going to have to be aligned in order to be able to come to a conclusion on the transaction. So timing is a little bit hard to predict. But I would still say that it is going to be in the midterm. And just in terms of the cost pressure in Europe, yes, we saw really an unprecedented spike in energy costs in Europe in the fourth quarter. And we started taking action then to be able to give us a little bit of insulation from that and started to move some surcharges into the market to be able to share some of that burden. So that is going to help us in the first quarter offset some of that. But the cost pressures that we saw in Europe are obviously going to be continuing as you look at the energy prices where they are today. But we're doing what we can to offset where possible. Sure. Thank you for the question, Mike. Look, we continue to see strong demand for polymers, and we expect that to continue in 2022. As markets recover from the pandemic, and especially the largest market in China and the supply chain constraints are worked through, we do expect that the market growth is going to be able to absorb a lot of the new capacity that's coming online. We still expect to see effective operating rates for polyethylene at greater than 90%, and that's obviously going to be supportive of margins going forward. We did see a downward trend in the prices in the fourth quarter, but we are seeing pricing find a floor. And as we come into the seasonally higher demand of the second quarter, I do expect that there is going to be good support for price increases going forward. We're already seeing spot pricing increasing pretty much in all regions, which is a good indicator. And remember as well, just going back to volume, December was the second-strongest demand month of 2021, which is pretty unusual when you look at historical demand patterns. With that and the combined impact of all of the downtime that we're expecting to see on both sides of the Atlantic and the U.S. and Europe, we're going to see markets continue to be tight, and we expect that to be supportive for pricing going forward. Sure, Bhavesh. Thank you for your question. And look as we've communicated before, we're exploring strategic options for this business and we do continue to believe that the asset has a higher value as part of the \u2013 an integrated network. I am sure you can appreciate we're \u2013 there is really not more that we can say at this time. We're in the middle of that process as we speak. And with where we are right now, I hope to be able to provide more details of the outcome and in the next few months. But that's really all that I can say at this point. Michael, I don't know if you wanted to add anything? Hi Arun, thank you for the question. Well, listen, like I had said before, I really do believe that with the robust demand that we are seeing in the markets and the pent-up demand that is still in the market yet to come. We saw in the second half of the year last year the largest market in China weakening in the second half of the year as they were approaching the Olympics and trying to keep the pandemic under control. There is a lot of demand that I believe is still yet to come back, and we are going to see that, I believe sometime in the middle of the year in the spring. And so that is going to be supportive overall. I don't think that this is related just to feedstock. It really is that demand is strong and supply is tighter than probably most people would expect. For polypropylene, certainly, we are optimistic for polypropylene this year where our portfolio is about 15% or so exposed to automotive. And that market is going to come back this year and that's also going to be supportive for polypropylene as we move forward in the year. Yes. Frank, good to hear from you as well. Thank you for the question. So look, in 2021, obviously, the biggest impact in terms of unplanned outage was Winter Storm Uri, which we don't expect that to recur obviously in 2022. So, that had an impact of $400 million to $500 million. So, that was one that is I guess the most material as you would call it. Then we had some other downtime in acetyls as well as at our La Porte olefins cracker. So net-net, that downtime last year was very high relative to history, the unplanned downtime. We certainly don't expect to see that level of downtime this year. Now if you look at the planned outages, the net impact of the planned outages from \u201821 to \u201822, it's going to be about a $50 million headwind because we are going to have a little bit higher planned downtime this year. In the first quarter, yes, sorry. So look, thank you, Chris, for the question. We have been \u2013 in the last couple of years, we have been implementing several growth projects, including new joint ventures in China and the U.S. We are always looking for opportunities that provide good returns to the company and especially in our core businesses. And we will continue to do that, especially to look for opportunities through the cycle. And right now, there is not anything that I can say specifically. We have talked about the Sasol opportunity, but there is really nothing more that I can comment on at this time. Sure, Kevin. Thank you for the question. Yes, we have set some ambitious targets for circularity, and it's our intent to be a leader in the circular plastics space. We do see this market developing rapidly, and it's an exciting area of growth that fits really well with our capabilities. So, it's going to be a clear focus for us. Both mechanical and advanced recycling are going to be areas that we are concentrating on as well as renewable products. As you know, we have mentioned previously that we are developing our own technology for advanced recycling called MoReTec. And we expect really to be able to assess the extent of that technology's advantage here in the next few months. Following that, we will be deciding on an initial commercial investment that should be completed around the middle of the decade. At the same time, we are looking at other paths to be able to reach that volume target. And we will be doing things like buying recycled and renewable feedstocks that we can track in our existing assets. And that of course, requires little or really no capital investment. So, all of these things are going to be levers that we are going to be pulling, working very closely with our customers and innovating with them on applications that we can roll out over time. Thank you for the question, Duffy. Look, the technology that we are building, the PO/TBA technology that we are building, is the most competitive in the world. So, I do want to just make sure we point that out. We are very confident in the technology. It's a technology that we operate today. It's a very large and complex plant, as you can imagine. So, I am not going to say that there is no risk. But from a technology standpoint, I really don't see a risk. Then to your question just around the ramp up, we will be ramping up beginning next year. And we see very good demand, and our teams are making very good progress on contracting the volume from that asset. I can tell you as well for the plant in China, the markets are very good there. And the growth in polyurethane is going to be able to absorb this new capacity that we are bringing on stream. In terms of the EBITDA impact, I would say, yes, for modeling purposes, you should be expecting the EBITDA contribution to be similar to what we have seen in the past. Yes. Thank you for your question, John. Michael, do you want to comment on that? Good morning Hassan. Thanks again for the question. Listen, if you look historically, years following when we have not seen good global growth, especially coming out of a year like we did with 2020, you can see double-digit growth rates even in China. And those types of growth years do typically occur once we see a snapback. And they are hard to predict, but they have occurred in the past. So, you can never bank on that. But my expectation is that the 8 million tons, there will be a combination of things that you see. All of the capacity is not going to be coming online exactly as we expect. Everybody understands that there are some constraints in China around that, especially with the dual control limitations. But the demand is going to come back and we have seen that in the past. So, a combination of some slower ramp-up of the capacity coming on, stronger demand, I certainly don't see a cliff in the second half of the year. I see it completely the opposite to that right now, but that's our view going forward. Thank you, P.J. Good morning. Yes, so there is a shortage of hexane in the market. And that combined with downtime at some of the linear low plants both in the U.S. and in Europe, has tightened that market pretty significantly. Now I will tell you that we are not having any constraints on hexane with our linear low business. So, that's good news. But for the industry, yes, there is tightness in that market, and I expect that that's going to continue in the short-term. Now going back to your question around our targets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 reductions that we have announced, in the next few years, we will be able to accommodate all of the things that we are looking at with our $2 billion capital spending. Our focus really in the next few years is going to be capturing the low-hanging fruit, really to make the first significant steps in the process of ramping up to the target in 2030. And that's going to include things like improved energy efficiency and some emission-reduction programs at our sites that really require little or no investment. Another low-capital enabler for our carbon-reduction targets is also going to be the increased utilization of renewable energy. So, we expect that within the next few years, the amount of capital that we have guided to, the $2 billion is going to be adequate for us to be able to get started on meeting these commitments. And then we will be identifying projects and developing detailed plans to achieve the full target in the second half of the decade. And that's likely to result in some increased capital, but we will have more to communicate on that later. Sure, David. I will start and then I will hand it over to Michael, let him comment a little bit. Oxyfuels, we had \u2013 especially in the fourth quarter, we had lower volumes, we had significantly lower volumes and margin challenges with butane feedstock prices running up. We are seeing that improving coming into the first quarter. So, we will see the volumes coming back and some relief with the butane feedstock pricing. Michael, I don't know if you want to add something to that. Sure. Hi Sean. We definitely see going forward the oil-to-gas ratio being favorable for our position in the U.S. markets. The high oil prices is certainly going to continue to pressure margins in Asia and Europe. But overall, net-net, we are expecting to see a continued favorable oil to gas ratio. Good morning Matthew. Thanks for your question. Well, listen, ethane inventories are still healthy and production is improving, especially in the Permian and the Bakken. So, even with the new crackers coming online, there is still excess ethane that's being rejected. And as production recovers and natural gas prices normalize, I do expect that ethane is going to remain the preferred feedstock. I will just add, too, that ethane rejection has only decreased slightly and still is about 800,000 barrels a day. And with the recovery having increased, there is really plenty of supply available. Okay. So listen, thank you again for all the thoughtful questions. Just before we close, I want to emphasize that our strategy remains unchanged. We have got great momentum, and we are going to continue focusing on safety, operational excellence as well as our disciplined approach to capital allocation. So, thank you very much for your interest in LyondellBasell. And we look forward to updating you on the progress at the end of April. Have a great weekend and stay safe."

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question and answer session. I'd now turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, Operator. Hello, and welcome to LyondellBasell's Third Quarter 2021 Teleconference. I'm joined today by Bob Patel, our Chief Executive Officer, and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call, and is available on our website at www. lyondellbasell.com. Investor relations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that can lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and a regulatory filings, which are also available at our Investor website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures together with other disclosures, including the earnings release. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 PM Eastern Time today until November 30th by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the During today's call, we will focus on Third Quarter results. The current environment, our near-term outlook, and provide an update on our growth initiatives.  Before turning the call over to Bob, I would like to call your attention to the non-cash lower cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM that we've discussed on past calls. These adjustments are related to our use of last-in, first-out or LIFO accounting, and the volatility in prices for our raw material and finished goods inventories. During the Third Quarter of 2020, we recognized a non-cash impairment of $582 million that reflected our expectation for reduced profitability from our Houston Refinery States.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of the refinery impairment and the LCM inventory adjustments. But that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Patel: Thank you, Dave. I'm pleased to join for my 28th and last earnings call as CEO of LyondellBasell. Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter. As I prepare to leave the Company at the end of the year, I have taken some time to reflect on the strong Company we have built, and our outlook for the future. Without a doubt, LyondellBasell's future is very bright. Because of the efforts of our incredibly talented and hardworking global team, we've built a Company that has proven it can perform under a range of conditions. During an event like a global pandemic that no one could have predicted or imagined, we were able to fund our dividend with cash from operations and grow our Company through accretive M&A.  I'm confident that LyondellBasell will continue to deliver for its stakeholders in the future. This is a Company that is focused on building value for the long term, and one that is built to stand the test of time. With that said, let's review our third quarter results. Please turn to slide three. LyondellBasell 's businesses are continuing to benefit from robust global demand and tight market conditions. In the third quarter, our Company delivered $5.25 per share of earnings, more than four times higher than the same quarter last year. EBITDA was approximately $2.7 billion, a year-over-year quarterly improvement of $1.8 billion.  Efficient cash conversion generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, a new quarterly record for our Company. These results are indicative of strong markets. The discipline with which we approached running our business, and the increased earnings power from our value-driven investments and accretive growth over the past several years. We remain focused on improving LyondellBasell's cash generation through all stages of the business cycle. Please turn to Slide 4 to review our quarterly profitability. While our portfolio delivered to $2.7 billion of EBITDA, this quarter's results reflect a sequential decline of 11%. Increased costs for natural gas, ethane, NAPFA, and butane compressed margins for many products from the high seen in the second quarter.  This, however, does not change how we see the future. We continue to see very solid demand for our products and remain highly constructive on the outlook for our businesses as global reopening continues to play out over the coming quarters. We expect the combination of a well-funded economy and pent-up consumer demand for durable goods, as well as the non-durable goods associated with travel, leisure, and other in-person activities will continue to [Indiscernible] attractive markets. In short, we remain confident that a reopening global economy, and eventual normalization of global supply chains will support continued growth for our businesses over the coming quarters.  Let's turn to slide 5 and review our safety performance. Our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors, rose to 0.24 during the third quarter. Much of this increase is associated with the tragic incident in our asset deals facility in La Porte, Texas during July. We remain committed to learning from this incident, and incorporating the learning's from the investigations to help prevent such tragedies from ever happening again. Looking more closely at the chart, we are encouraged by the notable improvement in chemical industry safety performance during 2020. We are watching to see if this is a durable trend or perhaps a one-time benefit from reduced in-person work hours during the high for depend pandemic.  At LyondellBasell, continuous learning and self-improving culture, our key focus areas in our pursuit of goal zero, safety performance for both our employees and our contractors. On slide six, I would like to highlight LyondellBasell 's increased commitments to help address the global challenge of climate change. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and a goal to achieve net zero, scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our growth -- global operations by 2015. We now aim to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline.  We plan to achieve these goals by a dancing progress on several fronts. First, we are improving energy efficiency in all our plants and reducing our need for high carbon content fuel sources, such as coal. We are already moving on this front. In September, we announced our plan to phase out coal from the power plant at our site investment in Germany. Second, we intend to procure at least 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  Third, we are focusing on minimizing flare emissions from our clients, particularly during shutdowns and startup events. In addition, we're evaluating a portfolio of technology options across the Company's manufacturing footprint, including sustainable hydrogen, increased electrification, and carbon capture for storage, for re-utilization in our processes. We believe this strategy puts us on an achievable pathway toward our net zero goal. In the near-term, we do not expect significant increases in our overall capital budget, as reduced spending associated with the completion of our POTBA (ph) project in 2022 will be offset by an increasing share of climate-related investment. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael Mc Murray: Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to share my sincere gratitude to Bob for his tireless work, inspirational energy, and thought partnership in leading and growing LyondellBasell for nearly 12 years. We're all sad to see you go Bob, but we will be eagerly watching your progress and wishing you continued success. Please turn to Slide 7 and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash-generation, which has been bolstered by our recent growth investments. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated a record $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the $5.4 billion of cash generated over the last 12 months.  Our pre - operating cash flow for the third quarter improved by more than 10% relative to the second quarter, and our pre -operating cash flow yield was 15% over the last 12 months. We expect this chart will continue to improve during the fourth quarter as 2020 results drop-off from our trailing performance. Let's turn to slide 8 and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the third quarter. As I've mentioned during previous calls, we are highly focused on shareholder returns. A strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In addition to our dividend, we also resumed share repurchases during the third quarter and reduced our share count by approximately $1 million.  We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $500 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flows supported debt reduction of nearly $700 million, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $2.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.9 billion. In July, S&P Global Ratings recognized the improvement in our balance sheet by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. During the fourth quarter, we expect that robust cash-generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $650 million of bonds in late October.  We do not foresee the need for additional debt repayment in 2022. Confidence around our deleveraging targets enabled us to resume share repurchases in September, and we continued to opportunistically repurchase shares during October. As of October 22nd, we have repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares. Now, I would like to highlight the results for each of our segments on slide nine in the third quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $2.7 billion. Our results reflect strong margins, supported by robust demand for our products and tight market conditions. Offset by higher cost primarily our OMP Europe, Asia, international segment and our I&D segment. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on slide 10 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefin 's America's segment.  Robust demand drove EBITDA to about $1.6 billion, slightly lower than the Second Quarter. Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million compared to the Second Quarter due to lower margins and volumes. Despite relatively stable benchmark ethylene margins. Our margins declined, as we purchased ethylene supplement production, and meet strong derivative demand. Volumes decreased due to unplanned maintenance, resulting in a cracker operating rate of 89%. Polyolefins results increased more than $75 million during the Third Quarter as robust demand and tight markets drove spreads higher with Polyolefin prices increasing slightly more than monomer prices. In fact, our polypropylene spreads reached a historic high. We continue to see strong demand for our products as we begin the fourth-quarter.  However, higher energy and feedstock costs, along with typical seasonality demand softness toward the end of the year, are likely to compress margins for our O&P America businesses. Now, please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefin in Europe, Asia, International segment. Higher feedstock costs and lower seasonal demand during summer holidays, reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets ph., resulting in a third quarter EBITDA of $474 million, $234 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins results declined about $50 million as margins decreased, driven by higher feedstock costs despite the higher ethylene and co-product prices. We operated our crackers at a rate of 92% of capacity due to planned maintenance.  Combined Polyolefin results decreased approximately a $120 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal band drove declines in Polyolefin price spreads relative to monitor costs and reduced volumes. Declining Polyolefin spread also affected our joint venture equity income by about $35 million. During the fourth quarter, we expect to see further margin declines from higher energy and feedstock costs along with end-of-year seasonality.  Our ethylene volumes are expected to decline due to planned maintenance. Please turn to Slide 12 as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. Rising feedstock and energy costs drove margin declines in most businesses resulted in third quarter EBITDA of $348 million, $248 million lower than the prior quarter. Results were impacted by approximately $25 billion due to site closure costs associated with the exit of our ethanol business. Third quarter propylene oxide and derivative results decreased about $15 million, as margins declined slightly from the historical highs of the second quarter. Durable goods demand remained strong. Resulting in increased volumes.  Intermediate chemicals results decreased approximately $140 million. Margins declined in most businesses, primarily serene, and volumes decreased as a result of downtime in our acetyl business. Oxyfuels and related products results decreased about $40 million as increased butane feedstock prices more than offset the increased volume from improved gasoline demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect volumes to increase with the restart of our LaPorte Acetyl Facility and continued strength in demand for durable goods. Margins are likely to moderate with fourth-quarter seasonality and higher raw material costs for I&D segment.  Now, let's move forward and review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on Slide 13. Customer supply chain constraints continue to hinged results with third quarter EBITDA of $121 million, $8 million lower than the second quarter. Compounding and solution results were relatively unchanged. Margins were higher, but partially offset by a decrease in volume due to restricted production and downstream markets including the automotive sector, appliance manufacturing, and other industries affected by semiconductor shortages. Advanced polymer results decreased about $10 million driven by lower margins and volumes, primarily due to plant maintenance.  We expect results will be similar in the fourth quarter as it will likely take several quarters before supply chain constraints begin to improve. Now, let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the result of our refining segment. Margins improved significantly in the third quarter, resulting in an EBITDA improvement of a $122 million to a positive $41 million. In the third quarter, prices for by-products increased costs for renewable identification number credits or RINs decreased and the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark in increased by $1.65 per barrel to $23.11 per barrel.  The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 260 thousand barrels per day, and operating rates of 97%. Improved demand from increasing mobility should be supportive for our refining margins and could enable continued profitability during the Fourth Quarter. Let's finish the segment discussion on slide 15 with the result of our technology segment. Increased licensing revenue drove Third Quarter EBITDA to a record $155 million, $63million higher than the prior quarter. We expect the Fourth Quarter profitability for a technology business will return to similar quarterly levels As the first half of this year, based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue, and catalyst demand. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob.\nBob Patel: Thank you, Michael. Please turn to slide 16 for a summary of the value-driven growth initiatives that our Company has developed since 2018. Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and forming the advanced polymer solutions segment from both legacy and acquired businesses. With the integration complete, we have a solid platform for future growth and synergies should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the market served by this segment. In the second quarter of 2020, we started at 500,000 ton per year polypropylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation hyper zone HDP technology.  At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this acetyl is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA. In September of 2020, we established a new integrated cracker joint venture in Northeastern China. This investment is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our Company, again, based upon full capacity and historical industry margins. In December of 2020, we closed the transaction for the integrated polyethylene joint venture in the Louisiana.  At full capacity in historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA for our Company. In our intermediate and derivatives segment, the combination of two new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023, put together at almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. Taken together, we estimate these initiatives could add up to $1.5 billion of EBITDA to our mid-cycle earnings. Slide 17 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our Company.  Over the period from 2011 to 2019,we delivered a little over an average of $6.5 billion of EBITDA, excluding LCM and impairment. In fact, we reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our Company. And today's strong market and with many of our growth initiatives providing strong contributions, our last 12 months performance was $8.6 billion exceeding our previous record, and reaching nearly 30% above the historical average.  While no two cycles are exactly alike, our performance during prior business cycles provides valuable context on how these growth initiatives might perform and reposition LyondellBasell during the next cycle with a larger asset base. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our business with slide 18. In the near to mid-term, further progress with vaccination roll outs should continue to support solid demand and margin for our products. With 7 billion doses of vaccines administered worldwide, approximately 1/2 of the world's population has now received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine.  New cases in the U.S. have fallen to less than half the level seen during the delta-driven spike of August and September. We're keeping a watchful eye on rising case rates in the UK and parts of Europe, but most virus indicators are trending in a favorable direction. Over the coming months, margins are expected to face headwinds from typical fourth quarter seasonality combined with increasing feedstock and energy prices. We anticipate some margin compression, but expect markets to remain relatively strong. Logistics constraints and the pace of vaccination are currently hindering demand. Eventually, consumers will have more options when purchasing a new car.  [Indiscernible] furniture will become available. And all of us will find a way to resume traveling, whether for business or leisure. Pent-up demand is tangible, and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods. Monetary stimulus may taper, but the unprecedented levels of stimulus deployed during the pandemic will have lasting effects that are typically supported for commodities. Let me close with Slide 19. As I think about the coming weeks and prepare to pass the baton to the next leader of LyondellBasell, I draw comfort from the knowledge that the broader team we have in place is incredibly talented and has created great momentum that will endure for many years.  In the end, our assets don't run themselves and decisions don't get made by spreadsheets. I'm confident that this remarkable team will continue to take our Company to greater heights. Our Company has never forgotten our core values built upon safety, reliability, and cost efficiency. These attributes form the basis for leading an advantage positions in our industry. With these strong foundations in place, we are deploying our business model across a larger asset base with embedded growth through projects such as our PO/TBA facility and further expansion of our global between measures of our partnerships.  Contending with our investment to reduce carbon emissions, we're also building innovative business models that will increase our utilization of plastic waste as a circular feedstock. My belief is that over the next decade, LyondellBasell will become a global market leader, in the exciting and rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. With strong markets and new sources of EBITDA, our team works diligently to maximize cash conversion. and we have taken care to reinvest that hard earned cash into accretive investments that add value, and drive future growth. All of this work is underpinned by a disciplined financial strategy.  We stand by our dual commitments to a growing dividend and an investment-grade credit rating through cycles. We are confident that we can complete our deleveraging and achieve our target of reducing debt by $4 billion before the end of this year with strong cash flows and no need for further debt reduction, we expect to continue reinvesting in our Company through the opportunistic repurchase of LyondellBasell 's shares. I hope you share my sincere enthusiasm about the future of our Company. We are now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. If you'd like to as a question, [Operator Instructions] We ask that you please limit your questions to one to allow time for everyone. Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas (ph) with JPMorgan, please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Elvers: Thanks very much. Bob, what do you think that the skill set of the new CEO of Lyondell should be? That is, what should he understand? What should his particular strength [Indiscernible]\nBob Patel: Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Good morning. Well, I think to be successful in the business that we compete in, having your firm from view about the importance of safety, reliability, and cost efficiency, it's what we did in the early days when we came out of the Chapter 11 process. And that will be important. And I recall as I, 7 years ago, roughly was named the CEO here. I talked about the importance of strategy and culture. And so, my sense is if I were to think about the next chapter, the things that I would add would be focus on circularity and our sustainability initiatives. And I think the uniqueness of our culture is that the next CEO who's grounded, rigorous, and works in service of the employees and the shareholders will be successful.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks. And good morning, everyone and thanks, Bob, and good luck on going forward. If I could just ask you, it's obviously been an unusual year with the weather and the outages, and the ship issue. If you could help us think about utilization rates for your assets in 2022, assuming no unplanned activity. When do you think you'll see polypropylene rates get back over 90% in the U.S.? I noticed polypropylene in the EAI had very high volume in the third quarter, is that a function of less demand for compounding PPs because of autos? But just how should we think about PP utilization rates in U.S. and Europe for next year?\nBob Patel: Sure. Thank you, Vincent. First of all, I will just mentioned a couple of words about Q3 and kind of the likeness we had. We had a couple of very a typical unplanned outages that were quite large. First, we had the asset deals unplanned downtime due to the incident we had. At Q3 volumes and margins or -- the volume lost in the Q3 margins, that outage impacted earnings by about $75 million. We also had a couple of larger, atypical events in O&P America 's at Q3 margins that lost volume impacted earnings by about 200 million. So we could take three or four incidents, and those outages reduced Q3 by about 275 million.  There were other normal unplanned outages that we have in any given quarter, but yes it was quite an unusual quarter in that regards. As I think about next year, you said it well, I mean, I think there's still a lot of constraints in terms of demand today. We still see a global supply chain that is not operating as smoothly as what we've seen in the past. Chip shortages, shipping restrict constraints, whether it's high cost for containers or just the ships being in the wrong place.  I think -- I believe firmly that that has impacted exports of finished goods out of China, which has in turn reduced demand for plastics in China. As we look in next year, I would expect that by the middle of the year, lot of these issues should have normalized, and we should see more typical global trade patterns. And with stronger durable goods market, especially for auto and appliances, those things that people have not had available to purchase that should favor polypropylene, probably more differentially than polyethylene. So I think by mid next year we should see operating rates sustained at over 90% and a lot of these constraints will have relieve themselves.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. Bob, I'd echo many of the comments Michael made in his prepared remarks about you and wish you all the best of luck in the future. My question for this morning is on the refinery, better operational results there in the quarter, but 6 or 7 weeks ago, I think you also announced the intent to revisit strategic options there. And so just wondering if you could comment on both of those, the near-term operational outlook, as well as the options on the strategic menu, and progress on that front lately.\nBob Patel: Thank you Kevin, for your kind words. So first on the business side, on the refinery, things are certainly turned positive. We turned a profit in Q3, as we mentioned during the prepared remarks. Q4 looks to be stronger than Q3. Of late what we're seeing with high oil prices, we're seeing more Canadian sour crude coming down to the U.S. which is causing the light heavy differential to widen. That favors our refinery and I think that trend could continue for the next quarter at least.  On the product side, distillate inventories are very low. Distillate cracks have expanded. We're seeing air travel get back to about 80% of pre - COVID levels in the U.S. Miles driven are back to pre - COVID levels now. So all of the trends when you think about demand, like heavy differential, all indicate improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And so we're pleased to be back in the black and refining. With regards to the process and the transaction, we're working through the process now and our aim is to move towards a transaction in the coming quarter or 2. We still continue to believe that the best value for this -- that this refinery can create is by being part of the system where it can be optimized from crude purchasing to logistics to the co-product processing. We think that a 270 thousand barrel a day refinery on the Houston ship channel is well-placed and create tones of value as part of a system.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Edlain Rodriguez with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nEdlain Rodriguez: Thank you. Good morning guys. And quick question for you, Bob. I mean, when you look over the next 12 to 24 months, clearly your expectation is for margins to moderate. You're not expecting a margin cliff like some more various participants out there. But the question is 1. Where can you be wrong? And 2. What are the market dynamics that you believe should prevent like a worst-case scenario?\nBob Patel: Yes. Great question, Edlain. I mean, this has been the debate for the last 12/15 months. And many of you will recall that I talked about demand being stronger for longer. I still believe that. I think when -- as you go quarter after quarter, all of the market forecasters have underestimated demand growth. And I think that will continue to play out. I mean, think about it. We still have reopening ahead of us. There's a lot of buying power in the hands of consumers. Highest historic savings rates in the U.S. and in many other regions around the world. They have still accommodative central bank policies. Even if tapering starts, still have very low Interest rate environment here and abroad.  And so much pent-up demand from goods and services that we couldn't access because the shortages or because of limitations on travel. So I think this sort of scenario of moderating margins is based on continued strong demand and strengthening as reopening really takes hold. And some of these supply chain constraints relieved themselves like the chip shortages. And you think about the impact in our compounding business fault because auto production is low, it's significant.  When those chips are available, we think that our polypropylene business, RPO business and our compounding business will benefit materially from more automotive production. You asked about what could go wrong, I think in the near term, we'll have to watch energy prices. There could be points where we could see potentially spikes in energy price. But I think sustained high energy prices are unlikely because at some point they will be met with more supply. So I think that's what we have to watch. And the other is, the picture in China remains a bit marquee, and I'll try to address that through the upcoming questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort (ph) with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Good morning, this is actually Mike here in for Bob. Probably, if I could just -- you started down the path that I wanted to ask about that as China's just considering all the dynamics around the energy controls and pass-through decarbonization effort. And what do you see a calendar future implications there for petrochemical? And perhaps just strategy for expansion in that region.\nBob Patel: Yes. So I don't profess to have the exact picture of what could happen, but I'll give you a few of my thoughts about what could happen. In terms of dual controls in the near term, you do see some lowering of petrochemical production. I think ultimately that will require more imports, which benefits exporting regions like the U.S., whether it's in the I&D business or in the OMP business, I think that's a net positive. I think the reduction of coal use will likely turn off some of the CTO complexes requiring more imports of polyethylene and polypropylene, favorable for global producers like us.  The shipping constraints, I think have been a net negative in the near-term, as they've not been producing for exports as much of finished goods. Two reasons. 1. They can't get enough containers. 2. Because shipping costs in many cases are 10X when you consider both the sea freight plus the container costs. They're just not able to pass that kind of increase on.  I think as that normalizes, I would think that demand should increase in China as they're able to export more finished goods next year and I think the longer-term outlook is that as there's less coal consumption, it seems to me that the amount of expansion that could take place in China could be less than what we've seen in the past. Certainly, MTO and CTO based technology or based capacity will likely not be as robust as what we've seen in the last 10 years. So I think there are many bullish aspects to how this could play out. But I think it'll be choppy over the next couple of quarters until we get back to something more normal.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Olympic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nHassan Ahmed: Morning, Bob and wishing you all the best. Bob, a question around near-term polyethylene dynamics. In the marketplace, it seems there are 2 camps now, you have the IHS guys talking about as much as $0.15 a pound and margin compression for polyethylene in Q4. And you have Dow that's talking about $0.07 to $0.08 a pound. So just trying to figure out which camp Lyondell 's in?\nBob Patel: Yeah. So in terms of PD price moderation in price is kind of where we are and we have them for some time. If you look back over the last 10 years, most every year you see some moderation in Q4 in polyethylene price, and I\nHassan Ahmed: think this year will be very similar. And at the same time, we do have feedstock costs that have come up some here in the U.S. by sensors on the feedstock side that ethane saves very abundant and available. And what setting the price for ethane is natural gas price. And it seems that natural gas prices kind of settled out here in the high 4, $5 per million Btu range. If that's our assumption. And of course we can have a spike here or there, but let's say we get through the winter in that range. And [Indiscernible] spreads are five to $0.07 a gallon for ethane. I think the cost side is kind of where\nBob Patel: we are and there could be some moderation in margin. 15 feels heavy to me, I suspect that it will be something more modest than that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning, Bob. As well, again, all the best in your future endeavors. Bob, a one of your competitor s has recently announced plans to spend a billion dollars a year to decarbonize our asset base. How do you think about the Lyondell's efforts to de -carbonize their base -- your base, and how much it will cost going forward? Yes. Thank you, Dave. First, let me talk more broadly about our sustainability strategy and how we think about that. We've been very clear that we want to lead on circularity, and we want to be a fast follower when it comes to CO2. So what that means, because it on circular parity, we want to lean into innovation and developing technologies. Whereas on CO2 reduction, we're likely to -- we could co-develop with others, but we may also combine that with licensing in technology. So having said all of that, when you think about our capex, first of all, we've been consistent that we believe our capex will be about $2 billion for per year through 2025.  So the next 4 full years, we expect to be around $2 billion of capex. In the back half of the decade, as we look to implement technologies like electric furnaces or whatever comes about, we think the CapEx could step up by about 0.5 billion a year in the back half of the decade. So instead of 2 -- 2.5 per year, maybe starting in 26. But I don't expect that to be sooner than that. $1 billion per year in sustainability related CapEx, that's not part of our plans as we sit here today.\nDavid Kinney: And Dave, when you think about next year, we have CapEx rolling off from PO/TBA projects gets completed. So we do have room within the budget above that line there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: Good morning. And Bob we'll miss you. Good luck in your next endeavor.\nBob Patel: Thank you. P.J.\nP.J. Juvekar: Question on feedstock slate. As natural gas prices -- natural gas liquid prices, NGL prices are going up in the U.S., ethane, propane how did you change your feedstock slate in North America and what do you expect going forward? And similar question in Europe where [Indiscernible] spiked, but natural gas prices also spiked. So how did the European feedstock slate change? And what do you see there as well?\nBob Patel: And thank you, P.J.. Let me talk a little bit of our broadly about energy prices as context, and then I'll get into the feedstock flexibility both here in Europe. First of all, as you look at kind of the outlook for oil prices, slightly that oil prices will persist -- will be persistently high over the next 2-3 years. We don't see large IOCs coming back to drill. The independents here are starting to drill more. But the very large companies who have presence in, for example, the Permian, we're not seeing drilling come back.  High oil prices are good for LyondellBasell. So I think over the long run, there will be plenty of ethane. I think ethane has -- there's more gas supply with more drilling. Ethane should be plentiful. Gas price should be kept in check, especially with feedstock flexibility, we'll have a chance to rotate to other feeds. In the near-term, we recently still find to be the favored feed. Propane and butane prices have run quite a lot. So they've been really out of the mix.  We have been cracking some gas oil and heavies as well. So think about like a barbell slate, light and heavy but in the middle, we've not been cracking in the U.S. in Europe, because of high LPG prices, we've been tracking that for our mainly and co-product values have been pretty good. I mean, VTR dying is run well. Propylene has come off some but still at very healthy levels. So overall, propane, butane, I would expect will be out of the mix for most of the winter. And we will focus on ethane, and the heavy end here in the U.S. and NAPFA in Europe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Parkinson (ph) with Mazuho, please proceed with your question.\nChris Parkinson: Thank you very much. Can you sit on our current demand trends and intermediates, where do you sense chain inventories are? How do you see the setup for 2022 profitability evolving in the context of more normalized operates? And maybe just a quick update on Oxyfuels as well. Thank you so much.\nBob Patel: Sure. Thank you, Chris. So first of all, on IND, PO continues to be very strong. propylene oxide demand is strong, the market continues to be tight. We will have a record year this year in our PO business. And we see that continuing as I mentioned earlier, in one of the prior questions, as auto demand comes back, appliance demand comes back because of constraints being relieved. We think that favors a continued strength in the PO business. And I actually think that our new capacity in '23 could come on at a time when the market desperately needs more PO. And I think it could be absorbed very quickly. So we're very constructive PO next year, Acetyl continues to be strong.  Power plant is back up and running as of early October, we're back to running at full rates and we're enjoying the benefits of a very good market and we think that'll carry well into '22. On Oxyfuels, demand is back, but unfortunately, the challenge today is higher butane price. So butane as a percent of crude oil, is kind of grown 90%. And likely through the winter months, we won't get much relief on that. But next year as we get into the spring, and LPG prices moderate after we get through the winter season.  And the demand should continue to improve and be better as driving improves in Europe and other parts of the world. I think Oxyfuels will get back to the typical contribution of 400 to 450 million annually prior to the new projects starting out. Styrene likely mixed. when there are outages, we see styrene get a bump when everyone runs. Styrene is either side of break even. And I think the real kind of gems in the portfolio next year will be propylene oxide, acetyls, and oxyfuels likely starting in the spring.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. So Bob, you made a comment that you want Lyondell to lead on circularity. And it's not a surprising comments coming from you given your leadership years ago and that aligns to plastic waste. are you -- is that an ethical issue or are you saying that because your customers are demanding it, you have these Circulon products. And my question for you is, do you have significant demand for those products now that you can't meet the supply? How long before you might have paralysis-based production or renewable feed stock-based production? How far away is this and is it meaningful?\nBob Patel: Yes. Thank you Steve. First, I think there are two aspects to this. The first is the demand side, and the second is playing to our strengths. On the demand side, absolutely our customers are asking for more and more circular products and plastics each year. Which they demand that we can't meet, and that's driven by their own commitments to increase recycled content and packaging. So the entire value chain is pulling, starting with the range owners. They're pulling more circular products, and I think that will just grow as the years progress. Why I think we should read on circularity is that, we have a strong technology base in Polyolefin.  We have Polyolefins process technology, catalyst technology, also we're developing this Martec Technology, which is the Molecular Recycling. That pilot plant should be operational in the coming weeks. And I suspect by about March, April, we will know whether we have an investable technology. My sense is that we will, the question will be to what degree can we get the yields that we want Paralysis oil. Our current plan is by end of next year to be in a position to dedicate some of our capEx to building a Martec plant, either in the U.S. or in Europe. So I think it plays to our strengths and the demand fall was there from brand owners.\nOperator: Thank you our next question comes from John Roberts (ph) with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Thanks and just in case we don't get another call with you Bob best wishes in the future.\nBob Patel: Thank you John.\nJohn Roberts: Your licensing activity gets an early look into industry expansion activity. I assume that new license discussions declined during the pandemic, but have discussions for new plant licenses increased significantly coming out of the recession and any differences between polyethylene and polypropylene?\nBob Patel: Sure. So John, we had a gap during the pandemic as you said, so I think probably something around 12, 15 months of much, much lower activity. It has picked up in Q3. More polypropylene than polyethylene and quite a bit of it in China. I think that's trend that we've seen. Having said that, pickup in demand or activity in Q3, we're still not quite back to 2019 levels. So I think still modest. And as you think about where you're going with this question, John is, what does it mean for supply 3, 4, 5 years out, I do think we're going to find a gap and new supply 3 years from now because those decisions to expand were delayed or paused during the pandemic.  And then if you look further out and you think about operating rates to more fully answer your question, beyond the couple of new projects that are coming in the U.S. and some pace of capacity in China, it seems to me that polyethylene and polypropylene operating rates likely reach some sort of a bottom in '22 or '23 and steadily increase. And that bottom is very shallow, if not maybe sideways from where we are today given our outlook on demand. So I think we do see operating rates increase as we move through into the middle of the decade.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question and I'll add my congrats and best wishes to you Bob, as well. Pleasure working with you. Just wanted to, I guess ask about polypropylene and the acetyl chain. So polypropylene, I guess was definitely impacted by the automotive shortages. Do you see that evolving to a better spot over the next 2 quarters? And then similarly with acetyl, was it mainly the downtime that held that business back in the quarter? And I guess maybe strident outlet there as well. Thanks.\nBob Patel: Certainly, I'll start with acetyl. Definitely, the downtime is what impacted us in Q3. And as I mentioned at Q3 margins, that lost volume reduced our earnings by about $75 million. Backup and running full rates now. And outlook is very good for acetyls. And our view is that margin should be very healthy even going into next year. So we're quite positive about that business. On polypropylene, auto was weak for packaging was quite strong and we had a lot of kind of medical-related demands. So that help polypropylene up. Now as we see auto come back for our Company, we have much more leverage to the auto recovery.  Did you think about our polypropylene sales to OEMS or tier 2s plus what goes through compounding plus some of our polyethylene that goes into plastic fuel tanks. Our Company will benefit immensely from the chip shortage. Hopefully alleviating, as result to the next few quarters. And I think you'll see that in the EPS business, there should be a meaningful step-up. Once we see [Indiscernible] come back. And as a result of all of that, I think PP business will remain tight. It's frankly pretty tight today. And demand continues to be really strong. And Arun, in our third quarter was more production shortfall because we had 2 weeks of downtime in Charlesberg (ph) facilities here in the United States as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question.\nFrank Mitsch: Hell of a run, Bob. Hell of a run. What are you most proud of during your tenure as CEO, and what do you think is the biggest piece of unfinished business that perhaps the next CEO auto addressed early on in his or her tenure?\nBob Patel: Thank you, Frank. It's really been great working with all of you and getting to know all of you better. What I'm most proud of, well, been 12 years with the Company. I almost joined a very different Company back in March of 2010. And I'm proud of the employees who stuck through it, through Mitch thick and thin. There are many people here who stayed during the Chapter 11 process, and won their Company back. And I'm really proud to have been a part of -- going from where we were back in March 2010 to where we are today. In terms of what's ahead, I think it's really about continuing to capture value from all these growth projects that we've implemented.  We've invested around $9 billion in 5 or 6 discrete initiatives, both organic and inorganic. And it provides an incredible runway for earnings growth. So I think it's really just capture the value from the growth that we've been through, continue to lean into circularity. Focus on CO2 reduction and be value minded when it comes to M&A. Deep value like we have been and be okay with saying no when the deal doesn't make sense. So I think we've built an incredible cash machine here at LyondellBasell.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nDuffy Fischer: Yeah, good morning. Two questions around Europe. So when you look at your business, one of your calling cards over the last decade was you guys going to lighter and more into LPG. At least in the near-term, that doesn't seem to be as beneficial. What's your view longer-term LPG versus NAPFA ratio? Where does that go?  What does it do to the competitiveness of your business within Europe? And then the second one is, if carbon prices are just structurally going to be higher in Europe, whether that's natural gas or LPG coming in, what does that do to the competitiveness of the European petrochemical business? And should we look to see meaningful reductions in production there, maybe over the next 5 years or so on the back of that?\nBob Patel: Thanks, Duffy. Both really great questions. On the European LPG competitiveness. I think this will have inflow. We've seen periods when LPG became expensive in Europe. We've seen when butane is traded at 45% of crude price. So, I think that'll continue part of the lower prices scenario will be when U.S. exports of butane and propane increase. As there's more oil production, associated gas, and the NGL that come with that. I think having flexibility benefits Companies like us, because it's so hard to predict what will be favored when.  But if you have flexibility, you tend to do well in a range of environments. And I think our Company has that both in the U.S. and in Europe. And your second question about competitiveness in Europe and the carbon initiatives. Well, there's Is a lot of legislation being considered. The way I think about it is that first of all, relative competitiveness is really important. And I think within the region, we have one of the most competitive asset basis. We've built that through all the work we did earlier in the last decade.  Over time you could see regulation that provides for border adjustments or things that will help protect the industrial economy in Europe. I think industrial employment is a very important part of the European economy. And I can't imagine that will just attrit away. So I always ask my team to focus on regional competitiveness, and make sure that we're at the most competitive end of the cost curve regionally.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Blair: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Wishing you the best, Bob, we'll definitely miss you. Something you could expand a little bit on your Ethylene outlook. You mentioned the supply is abundant now. We do have some new crackers coming online plus the potential ramp of ethane exports. So for those incremental demand, is that something that you think would be covered by incremental production? Just given the recent increase in the rig count or would it need to pull from, its either like rejection or inventory?\nBob Patel: Thank you, Matt. It's been a pleasure working with you as well. I've had lots of discussions with some of our largest suppliers on this topic, and I think with new capacity coming here in Corpus, and more demand for ethane, my sense is that between the amount that's rejected today, that could be recovered. And incremental output from the independents who are starting to ramp up in the Permian, I think there's enough ethane.  The price setter on ethane, I continue to believe will be natural gas with a modest frac spread to get to the ethane price. We've done a lot of work on this and we think that likely is a scenario. And then longer term, I think the feedstock flexibility here in the U.S. will serve us well. As the various scenarios play out, and you could make a good argument for -- well, the oil to gas ratio widening as we get past summer of 22 and into the next couple of three years.\nOperator: Thanks you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Bob Patel for closing remarks.\nBob Patel: Thank you again for all the thoughtful questions. Let me offer a few closing remarks. First of all, we continue to believe that demand will remain strong well into 2022 for all of our products and markets we serve. Though we are likely to face some margin pressure from rising energy and feedstock costs, we expect that our earnings and cash flow will remain robust. LyondellBasell has an array of options to create shareholder value, ranging from a growing dividend, share repurchases, and value trading M&A.  It's been my sincere pleasure and honor to serve and privilege to serve as CEO and support of our incredible employees and shareholders for nearly 7 years. We've built an incredibly strong Company over the past 12 years and I'm thankful to have been a part of it. I've enjoyed getting to know all of you and working with you. And we remain very optimistic about the future of LYB. Thank you and best wishes to all of you. We're now adjourned.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your line and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Michael Mc Murray",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob. Good morning, everyone. Before I begin, I would like to share my sincere gratitude to Bob for his tireless work, inspirational energy, and thought partnership in leading and growing LyondellBasell for nearly 12 years. We're all sad to see you go Bob, but we will be eagerly watching your progress and wishing you continued success. Please turn to Slide 7 and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash-generation, which has been bolstered by our recent growth investments. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated a record $2.1 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the $5.4 billion of cash generated over the last 12 months.  Our pre - operating cash flow for the third quarter improved by more than 10% relative to the second quarter, and our pre -operating cash flow yield was 15% over the last 12 months. We expect this chart will continue to improve during the fourth quarter as 2020 results drop-off from our trailing performance. Let's turn to slide 8 and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the third quarter. As I've mentioned during previous calls, we are highly focused on shareholder returns. A strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In addition to our dividend, we also resumed share repurchases during the third quarter and reduced our share count by approximately $1 million.  We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $500 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flows supported debt reduction of nearly $700 million, bringing our year-to-date debt reduction to $2.4 billion. We closed the third quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.9 billion. In July, S&P Global Ratings recognized the improvement in our balance sheet by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. During the fourth quarter, we expect that robust cash-generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment-grade balance sheet. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $650 million of bonds in late October.  We do not foresee the need for additional debt repayment in 2022. Confidence around our deleveraging targets enabled us to resume share repurchases in September, and we continued to opportunistically repurchase shares during October. As of October 22nd, we have repurchased a total of 1.6 million shares. Now, I would like to highlight the results for each of our segments on slide nine in the third quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $2.7 billion. Our results reflect strong margins, supported by robust demand for our products and tight market conditions. Offset by higher cost primarily our OMP Europe, Asia, international segment and our I&D segment. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on slide 10 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefin 's America's segment.  Robust demand drove EBITDA to about $1.6 billion, slightly lower than the Second Quarter. Olefins results decreased approximately $75 million compared to the Second Quarter due to lower margins and volumes. Despite relatively stable benchmark ethylene margins. Our margins declined, as we purchased ethylene supplement production, and meet strong derivative demand. Volumes decreased due to unplanned maintenance, resulting in a cracker operating rate of 89%. Polyolefins results increased more than $75 million during the Third Quarter as robust demand and tight markets drove spreads higher with Polyolefin prices increasing slightly more than monomer prices. In fact, our polypropylene spreads reached a historic high. We continue to see strong demand for our products as we begin the fourth-quarter.  However, higher energy and feedstock costs, along with typical seasonality demand softness toward the end of the year, are likely to compress margins for our O&P America businesses. Now, please turn to Slide 11 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefin in Europe, Asia, International segment. Higher feedstock costs and lower seasonal demand during summer holidays, reduced margins and volumes in our EAI markets ph., resulting in a third quarter EBITDA of $474 million, $234 million lower than the second quarter. Olefins results declined about $50 million as margins decreased, driven by higher feedstock costs despite the higher ethylene and co-product prices. We operated our crackers at a rate of 92% of capacity due to planned maintenance.  Combined Polyolefin results decreased approximately a $120 million compared to the prior quarter. Lower seasonal band drove declines in Polyolefin price spreads relative to monitor costs and reduced volumes. Declining Polyolefin spread also affected our joint venture equity income by about $35 million. During the fourth quarter, we expect to see further margin declines from higher energy and feedstock costs along with end-of-year seasonality.  Our ethylene volumes are expected to decline due to planned maintenance. Please turn to Slide 12 as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. Rising feedstock and energy costs drove margin declines in most businesses resulted in third quarter EBITDA of $348 million, $248 million lower than the prior quarter. Results were impacted by approximately $25 billion due to site closure costs associated with the exit of our ethanol business. Third quarter propylene oxide and derivative results decreased about $15 million, as margins declined slightly from the historical highs of the second quarter. Durable goods demand remained strong. Resulting in increased volumes.  Intermediate chemicals results decreased approximately $140 million. Margins declined in most businesses, primarily serene, and volumes decreased as a result of downtime in our acetyl business. Oxyfuels and related products results decreased about $40 million as increased butane feedstock prices more than offset the increased volume from improved gasoline demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect volumes to increase with the restart of our LaPorte Acetyl Facility and continued strength in demand for durable goods. Margins are likely to moderate with fourth-quarter seasonality and higher raw material costs for I&D segment.  Now, let's move forward and review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on Slide 13. Customer supply chain constraints continue to hinged results with third quarter EBITDA of $121 million, $8 million lower than the second quarter. Compounding and solution results were relatively unchanged. Margins were higher, but partially offset by a decrease in volume due to restricted production and downstream markets including the automotive sector, appliance manufacturing, and other industries affected by semiconductor shortages. Advanced polymer results decreased about $10 million driven by lower margins and volumes, primarily due to plant maintenance.  We expect results will be similar in the fourth quarter as it will likely take several quarters before supply chain constraints begin to improve. Now, let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the result of our refining segment. Margins improved significantly in the third quarter, resulting in an EBITDA improvement of a $122 million to a positive $41 million. In the third quarter, prices for by-products increased costs for renewable identification number credits or RINs decreased and the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark in increased by $1.65 per barrel to $23.11 per barrel.  The average crude throughput at the refinery increased to 260 thousand barrels per day, and operating rates of 97%. Improved demand from increasing mobility should be supportive for our refining margins and could enable continued profitability during the Fourth Quarter. Let's finish the segment discussion on slide 15 with the result of our technology segment. Increased licensing revenue drove Third Quarter EBITDA to a record $155 million, $63million higher than the prior quarter. We expect the Fourth Quarter profitability for a technology business will return to similar quarterly levels As the first half of this year, based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue, and catalyst demand. With that, I will turn the call over to Bob."

            "name": "Bob Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. I'm pleased to join for my 28th and last earnings call as CEO of LyondellBasell. Per our usual practice, we will review our results from the quarter. As I prepare to leave the Company at the end of the year, I have taken some time to reflect on the strong Company we have built, and our outlook for the future. Without a doubt, LyondellBasell's future is very bright. Because of the efforts of our incredibly talented and hardworking global team, we've built a Company that has proven it can perform under a range of conditions. During an event like a global pandemic that no one could have predicted or imagined, we were able to fund our dividend with cash from operations and grow our Company through accretive M&A.  I'm confident that LyondellBasell will continue to deliver for its stakeholders in the future. This is a Company that is focused on building value for the long term, and one that is built to stand the test of time. With that said, let's review our third quarter results. Please turn to slide three. LyondellBasell 's businesses are continuing to benefit from robust global demand and tight market conditions. In the third quarter, our Company delivered $5.25 per share of earnings, more than four times higher than the same quarter last year. EBITDA was approximately $2.7 billion, a year-over-year quarterly improvement of $1.8 billion.  Efficient cash conversion generated $2.1 billion in cash from operating activities, a new quarterly record for our Company. These results are indicative of strong markets. The discipline with which we approached running our business, and the increased earnings power from our value-driven investments and accretive growth over the past several years. We remain focused on improving LyondellBasell's cash generation through all stages of the business cycle. Please turn to Slide 4 to review our quarterly profitability. While our portfolio delivered to $2.7 billion of EBITDA, this quarter's results reflect a sequential decline of 11%. Increased costs for natural gas, ethane, NAPFA, and butane compressed margins for many products from the high seen in the second quarter.  This, however, does not change how we see the future. We continue to see very solid demand for our products and remain highly constructive on the outlook for our businesses as global reopening continues to play out over the coming quarters. We expect the combination of a well-funded economy and pent-up consumer demand for durable goods, as well as the non-durable goods associated with travel, leisure, and other in-person activities will continue to [Indiscernible] attractive markets. In short, we remain confident that a reopening global economy, and eventual normalization of global supply chains will support continued growth for our businesses over the coming quarters.  Let's turn to slide 5 and review our safety performance. Our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors, rose to 0.24 during the third quarter. Much of this increase is associated with the tragic incident in our asset deals facility in La Porte, Texas during July. We remain committed to learning from this incident, and incorporating the learning's from the investigations to help prevent such tragedies from ever happening again. Looking more closely at the chart, we are encouraged by the notable improvement in chemical industry safety performance during 2020. We are watching to see if this is a durable trend or perhaps a one-time benefit from reduced in-person work hours during the high for depend pandemic.  At LyondellBasell, continuous learning and self-improving culture, our key focus areas in our pursuit of goal zero, safety performance for both our employees and our contractors. On slide six, I would like to highlight LyondellBasell 's increased commitments to help address the global challenge of climate change. In late September, we announced accelerated targets and a goal to achieve net zero, scope 1 and scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our growth -- global operations by 2015. We now aim to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline.  We plan to achieve these goals by a dancing progress on several fronts. First, we are improving energy efficiency in all our plants and reducing our need for high carbon content fuel sources, such as coal. We are already moving on this front. In September, we announced our plan to phase out coal from the power plant at our site investment in Germany. Second, we intend to procure at least 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  Third, we are focusing on minimizing flare emissions from our clients, particularly during shutdowns and startup events. In addition, we're evaluating a portfolio of technology options across the Company's manufacturing footprint, including sustainable hydrogen, increased electrification, and carbon capture for storage, for re-utilization in our processes. We believe this strategy puts us on an achievable pathway toward our net zero goal. In the near-term, we do not expect significant increases in our overall capital budget, as reduced spending associated with the completion of our POTBA (ph) project in 2022 will be offset by an increasing share of climate-related investment. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Michael. Please turn to slide 16 for a summary of the value-driven growth initiatives that our Company has developed since 2018. Our approach is to pursue prudent and accretive investments that chart a clear path for increasing EBITDA. In 2018, we expanded our compounding business by acquiring A. Schulman and forming the advanced polymer solutions segment from both legacy and acquired businesses. With the integration complete, we have a solid platform for future growth and synergies should become increasingly visible as volumes recover in the market served by this segment. In the second quarter of 2020, we started at 500,000 ton per year polypropylene plant in Houston, utilizing our next-generation hyper zone HDP technology.  At full nameplate capacity and average margins from 2017 to 2019, we estimate this acetyl is capable of generating $170 million of annual EBITDA. In September of 2020, we established a new integrated cracker joint venture in Northeastern China. This investment is capable of generating $150 million of annual EBITDA for our Company, again, based upon full capacity and historical industry margins. In December of 2020, we closed the transaction for the integrated polyethylene joint venture in the Louisiana.  At full capacity in historical margins, this investment is capable of contributing $330 million in EBITDA for our Company. In our intermediate and derivatives segment, the combination of two new propylene oxide investments in China and Houston starting in 2022 and 2023, put together at almost $500 million of annual estimated EBITDA. Taken together, we estimate these initiatives could add up to $1.5 billion of EBITDA to our mid-cycle earnings. Slide 17 provides a historical view of LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our Company.  Over the period from 2011 to 2019,we delivered a little over an average of $6.5 billion of EBITDA, excluding LCM and impairment. In fact, we reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our Company. And today's strong market and with many of our growth initiatives providing strong contributions, our last 12 months performance was $8.6 billion exceeding our previous record, and reaching nearly 30% above the historical average.  While no two cycles are exactly alike, our performance during prior business cycles provides valuable context on how these growth initiatives might perform and reposition LyondellBasell during the next cycle with a larger asset base. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our business with slide 18. In the near to mid-term, further progress with vaccination roll outs should continue to support solid demand and margin for our products. With 7 billion doses of vaccines administered worldwide, approximately 1/2 of the world's population has now received at least one dose of a COVID vaccine.  New cases in the U.S. have fallen to less than half the level seen during the delta-driven spike of August and September. We're keeping a watchful eye on rising case rates in the UK and parts of Europe, but most virus indicators are trending in a favorable direction. Over the coming months, margins are expected to face headwinds from typical fourth quarter seasonality combined with increasing feedstock and energy prices. We anticipate some margin compression, but expect markets to remain relatively strong. Logistics constraints and the pace of vaccination are currently hindering demand. Eventually, consumers will have more options when purchasing a new car.  [Indiscernible] furniture will become available. And all of us will find a way to resume traveling, whether for business or leisure. Pent-up demand is tangible, and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods. Monetary stimulus may taper, but the unprecedented levels of stimulus deployed during the pandemic will have lasting effects that are typically supported for commodities. Let me close with Slide 19. As I think about the coming weeks and prepare to pass the baton to the next leader of LyondellBasell, I draw comfort from the knowledge that the broader team we have in place is incredibly talented and has created great momentum that will endure for many years.  In the end, our assets don't run themselves and decisions don't get made by spreadsheets. I'm confident that this remarkable team will continue to take our Company to greater heights. Our Company has never forgotten our core values built upon safety, reliability, and cost efficiency. These attributes form the basis for leading an advantage positions in our industry. With these strong foundations in place, we are deploying our business model across a larger asset base with embedded growth through projects such as our PO/TBA facility and further expansion of our global between measures of our partnerships.  Contending with our investment to reduce carbon emissions, we're also building innovative business models that will increase our utilization of plastic waste as a circular feedstock. My belief is that over the next decade, LyondellBasell will become a global market leader, in the exciting and rapidly growing market for sustainable plastics. With strong markets and new sources of EBITDA, our team works diligently to maximize cash conversion. and we have taken care to reinvest that hard earned cash into accretive investments that add value, and drive future growth. All of this work is underpinned by a disciplined financial strategy.  We stand by our dual commitments to a growing dividend and an investment-grade credit rating through cycles. We are confident that we can complete our deleveraging and achieve our target of reducing debt by $4 billion before the end of this year with strong cash flows and no need for further debt reduction, we expect to continue reinvesting in our Company through the opportunistic repurchase of LyondellBasell 's shares. I hope you share my sincere enthusiasm about the future of our Company. We are now pleased to take your questions. Okay. Thank you, Jeff. Good morning. Well, I think to be successful in the business that we compete in, having your firm from view about the importance of safety, reliability, and cost efficiency, it's what we did in the early days when we came out of the Chapter 11 process. And that will be important. And I recall as I, 7 years ago, roughly was named the CEO here. I talked about the importance of strategy and culture. And so, my sense is if I were to think about the next chapter, the things that I would add would be focus on circularity and our sustainability initiatives. And I think the uniqueness of our culture is that the next CEO who's grounded, rigorous, and works in service of the employees and the shareholders will be successful. Sure. Thank you, Vincent. First of all, I will just mentioned a couple of words about Q3 and kind of the likeness we had. We had a couple of very a typical unplanned outages that were quite large. First, we had the asset deals unplanned downtime due to the incident we had. At Q3 volumes and margins or -- the volume lost in the Q3 margins, that outage impacted earnings by about $75 million. We also had a couple of larger, atypical events in O&P America 's at Q3 margins that lost volume impacted earnings by about 200 million. So we could take three or four incidents, and those outages reduced Q3 by about 275 million.  There were other normal unplanned outages that we have in any given quarter, but yes it was quite an unusual quarter in that regards. As I think about next year, you said it well, I mean, I think there's still a lot of constraints in terms of demand today. We still see a global supply chain that is not operating as smoothly as what we've seen in the past. Chip shortages, shipping restrict constraints, whether it's high cost for containers or just the ships being in the wrong place.  I think -- I believe firmly that that has impacted exports of finished goods out of China, which has in turn reduced demand for plastics in China. As we look in next year, I would expect that by the middle of the year, lot of these issues should have normalized, and we should see more typical global trade patterns. And with stronger durable goods market, especially for auto and appliances, those things that people have not had available to purchase that should favor polypropylene, probably more differentially than polyethylene. So I think by mid next year we should see operating rates sustained at over 90% and a lot of these constraints will have relieve themselves. Thank you Kevin, for your kind words. So first on the business side, on the refinery, things are certainly turned positive. We turned a profit in Q3, as we mentioned during the prepared remarks. Q4 looks to be stronger than Q3. Of late what we're seeing with high oil prices, we're seeing more Canadian sour crude coming down to the U.S. which is causing the light heavy differential to widen. That favors our refinery and I think that trend could continue for the next quarter at least.  On the product side, distillate inventories are very low. Distillate cracks have expanded. We're seeing air travel get back to about 80% of pre - COVID levels in the U.S. Miles driven are back to pre - COVID levels now. So all of the trends when you think about demand, like heavy differential, all indicate improvement sequentially from Q3 to Q4. And so we're pleased to be back in the black and refining. With regards to the process and the transaction, we're working through the process now and our aim is to move towards a transaction in the coming quarter or 2. We still continue to believe that the best value for this -- that this refinery can create is by being part of the system where it can be optimized from crude purchasing to logistics to the co-product processing. We think that a 270 thousand barrel a day refinery on the Houston ship channel is well-placed and create tones of value as part of a system. Yes. Great question, Edlain. I mean, this has been the debate for the last 12/15 months. And many of you will recall that I talked about demand being stronger for longer. I still believe that. I think when -- as you go quarter after quarter, all of the market forecasters have underestimated demand growth. And I think that will continue to play out. I mean, think about it. We still have reopening ahead of us. There's a lot of buying power in the hands of consumers. Highest historic savings rates in the U.S. and in many other regions around the world. They have still accommodative central bank policies. Even if tapering starts, still have very low Interest rate environment here and abroad.  And so much pent-up demand from goods and services that we couldn't access because the shortages or because of limitations on travel. So I think this sort of scenario of moderating margins is based on continued strong demand and strengthening as reopening really takes hold. And some of these supply chain constraints relieved themselves like the chip shortages. And you think about the impact in our compounding business fault because auto production is low, it's significant.  When those chips are available, we think that our polypropylene business, RPO business and our compounding business will benefit materially from more automotive production. You asked about what could go wrong, I think in the near term, we'll have to watch energy prices. There could be points where we could see potentially spikes in energy price. But I think sustained high energy prices are unlikely because at some point they will be met with more supply. So I think that's what we have to watch. And the other is, the picture in China remains a bit marquee, and I'll try to address that through the upcoming questions. Yes. So I don't profess to have the exact picture of what could happen, but I'll give you a few of my thoughts about what could happen. In terms of dual controls in the near term, you do see some lowering of petrochemical production. I think ultimately that will require more imports, which benefits exporting regions like the U.S., whether it's in the I&D business or in the OMP business, I think that's a net positive. I think the reduction of coal use will likely turn off some of the CTO complexes requiring more imports of polyethylene and polypropylene, favorable for global producers like us.  The shipping constraints, I think have been a net negative in the near-term, as they've not been producing for exports as much of finished goods. Two reasons. 1. They can't get enough containers. 2. Because shipping costs in many cases are 10X when you consider both the sea freight plus the container costs. They're just not able to pass that kind of increase on.  I think as that normalizes, I would think that demand should increase in China as they're able to export more finished goods next year and I think the longer-term outlook is that as there's less coal consumption, it seems to me that the amount of expansion that could take place in China could be less than what we've seen in the past. Certainly, MTO and CTO based technology or based capacity will likely not be as robust as what we've seen in the last 10 years. So I think there are many bullish aspects to how this could play out. But I think it'll be choppy over the next couple of quarters until we get back to something more normal. Yeah. So in terms of PD price moderation in price is kind of where we are and we have them for some time. If you look back over the last 10 years, most every year you see some moderation in Q4 in polyethylene price, and I we are and there could be some moderation in margin. 15 feels heavy to me, I suspect that it will be something more modest than that. Thank you. P.J. And thank you, P.J.. Let me talk a little bit of our broadly about energy prices as context, and then I'll get into the feedstock flexibility both here in Europe. First of all, as you look at kind of the outlook for oil prices, slightly that oil prices will persist -- will be persistently high over the next 2-3 years. We don't see large IOCs coming back to drill. The independents here are starting to drill more. But the very large companies who have presence in, for example, the Permian, we're not seeing drilling come back.  High oil prices are good for LyondellBasell. So I think over the long run, there will be plenty of ethane. I think ethane has -- there's more gas supply with more drilling. Ethane should be plentiful. Gas price should be kept in check, especially with feedstock flexibility, we'll have a chance to rotate to other feeds. In the near-term, we recently still find to be the favored feed. Propane and butane prices have run quite a lot. So they've been really out of the mix.  We have been cracking some gas oil and heavies as well. So think about like a barbell slate, light and heavy but in the middle, we've not been cracking in the U.S. in Europe, because of high LPG prices, we've been tracking that for our mainly and co-product values have been pretty good. I mean, VTR dying is run well. Propylene has come off some but still at very healthy levels. So overall, propane, butane, I would expect will be out of the mix for most of the winter. And we will focus on ethane, and the heavy end here in the U.S. and NAPFA in Europe. Sure. Thank you, Chris. So first of all, on IND, PO continues to be very strong. propylene oxide demand is strong, the market continues to be tight. We will have a record year this year in our PO business. And we see that continuing as I mentioned earlier, in one of the prior questions, as auto demand comes back, appliance demand comes back because of constraints being relieved. We think that favors a continued strength in the PO business. And I actually think that our new capacity in '23 could come on at a time when the market desperately needs more PO. And I think it could be absorbed very quickly. So we're very constructive PO next year, Acetyl continues to be strong.  Power plant is back up and running as of early October, we're back to running at full rates and we're enjoying the benefits of a very good market and we think that'll carry well into '22. On Oxyfuels, demand is back, but unfortunately, the challenge today is higher butane price. So butane as a percent of crude oil, is kind of grown 90%. And likely through the winter months, we won't get much relief on that. But next year as we get into the spring, and LPG prices moderate after we get through the winter season.  And the demand should continue to improve and be better as driving improves in Europe and other parts of the world. I think Oxyfuels will get back to the typical contribution of 400 to 450 million annually prior to the new projects starting out. Styrene likely mixed. when there are outages, we see styrene get a bump when everyone runs. Styrene is either side of break even. And I think the real kind of gems in the portfolio next year will be propylene oxide, acetyls, and oxyfuels likely starting in the spring. Yes. Thank you Steve. First, I think there are two aspects to this. The first is the demand side, and the second is playing to our strengths. On the demand side, absolutely our customers are asking for more and more circular products and plastics each year. Which they demand that we can't meet, and that's driven by their own commitments to increase recycled content and packaging. So the entire value chain is pulling, starting with the range owners. They're pulling more circular products, and I think that will just grow as the years progress. Why I think we should read on circularity is that, we have a strong technology base in Polyolefin.  We have Polyolefins process technology, catalyst technology, also we're developing this Martec Technology, which is the Molecular Recycling. That pilot plant should be operational in the coming weeks. And I suspect by about March, April, we will know whether we have an investable technology. My sense is that we will, the question will be to what degree can we get the yields that we want Paralysis oil. Our current plan is by end of next year to be in a position to dedicate some of our capEx to building a Martec plant, either in the U.S. or in Europe. So I think it plays to our strengths and the demand fall was there from brand owners. Thank you John. Sure. So John, we had a gap during the pandemic as you said, so I think probably something around 12, 15 months of much, much lower activity. It has picked up in Q3. More polypropylene than polyethylene and quite a bit of it in China. I think that's trend that we've seen. Having said that, pickup in demand or activity in Q3, we're still not quite back to 2019 levels. So I think still modest. And as you think about where you're going with this question, John is, what does it mean for supply 3, 4, 5 years out, I do think we're going to find a gap and new supply 3 years from now because those decisions to expand were delayed or paused during the pandemic.  And then if you look further out and you think about operating rates to more fully answer your question, beyond the couple of new projects that are coming in the U.S. and some pace of capacity in China, it seems to me that polyethylene and polypropylene operating rates likely reach some sort of a bottom in '22 or '23 and steadily increase. And that bottom is very shallow, if not maybe sideways from where we are today given our outlook on demand. So I think we do see operating rates increase as we move through into the middle of the decade. Certainly, I'll start with acetyl. Definitely, the downtime is what impacted us in Q3. And as I mentioned at Q3 margins, that lost volume reduced our earnings by about $75 million. Backup and running full rates now. And outlook is very good for acetyls. And our view is that margin should be very healthy even going into next year. So we're quite positive about that business. On polypropylene, auto was weak for packaging was quite strong and we had a lot of kind of medical-related demands. So that help polypropylene up. Now as we see auto come back for our Company, we have much more leverage to the auto recovery.  Did you think about our polypropylene sales to OEMS or tier 2s plus what goes through compounding plus some of our polyethylene that goes into plastic fuel tanks. Our Company will benefit immensely from the chip shortage. Hopefully alleviating, as result to the next few quarters. And I think you'll see that in the EPS business, there should be a meaningful step-up. Once we see [Indiscernible] come back. And as a result of all of that, I think PP business will remain tight. It's frankly pretty tight today. And demand continues to be really strong. And Arun, in our third quarter was more production shortfall because we had 2 weeks of downtime in Charlesberg (ph) facilities here in the United States as well. Thank you, Frank. It's really been great working with all of you and getting to know all of you better. What I'm most proud of, well, been 12 years with the Company. I almost joined a very different Company back in March of 2010. And I'm proud of the employees who stuck through it, through Mitch thick and thin. There are many people here who stayed during the Chapter 11 process, and won their Company back. And I'm really proud to have been a part of -- going from where we were back in March 2010 to where we are today. In terms of what's ahead, I think it's really about continuing to capture value from all these growth projects that we've implemented.  We've invested around $9 billion in 5 or 6 discrete initiatives, both organic and inorganic. And it provides an incredible runway for earnings growth. So I think it's really just capture the value from the growth that we've been through, continue to lean into circularity. Focus on CO2 reduction and be value minded when it comes to M&A. Deep value like we have been and be okay with saying no when the deal doesn't make sense. So I think we've built an incredible cash machine here at LyondellBasell. Thanks, Duffy. Both really great questions. On the European LPG competitiveness. I think this will have inflow. We've seen periods when LPG became expensive in Europe. We've seen when butane is traded at 45% of crude price. So, I think that'll continue part of the lower prices scenario will be when U.S. exports of butane and propane increase. As there's more oil production, associated gas, and the NGL that come with that. I think having flexibility benefits Companies like us, because it's so hard to predict what will be favored when.  But if you have flexibility, you tend to do well in a range of environments. And I think our Company has that both in the U.S. and in Europe. And your second question about competitiveness in Europe and the carbon initiatives. Well, there's Is a lot of legislation being considered. The way I think about it is that first of all, relative competitiveness is really important. And I think within the region, we have one of the most competitive asset basis. We've built that through all the work we did earlier in the last decade.  Over time you could see regulation that provides for border adjustments or things that will help protect the industrial economy in Europe. I think industrial employment is a very important part of the European economy. And I can't imagine that will just attrit away. So I always ask my team to focus on regional competitiveness, and make sure that we're at the most competitive end of the cost curve regionally. Thank you, Matt. It's been a pleasure working with you as well. I've had lots of discussions with some of our largest suppliers on this topic, and I think with new capacity coming here in Corpus, and more demand for ethane, my sense is that between the amount that's rejected today, that could be recovered. And incremental output from the independents who are starting to ramp up in the Permian, I think there's enough ethane.  The price setter on ethane, I continue to believe will be natural gas with a modest frac spread to get to the ethane price. We've done a lot of work on this and we think that likely is a scenario. And then longer term, I think the feedstock flexibility here in the U.S. will serve us well. As the various scenarios play out, and you could make a good argument for -- well, the oil to gas ratio widening as we get past summer of 22 and into the next couple of three years. Thank you again for all the thoughtful questions. Let me offer a few closing remarks. First of all, we continue to believe that demand will remain strong well into 2022 for all of our products and markets we serve. Though we are likely to face some margin pressure from rising energy and feedstock costs, we expect that our earnings and cash flow will remain robust. LyondellBasell has an array of options to create shareholder value, ranging from a growing dividend, share repurchases, and value trading M&A.  It's been my sincere pleasure and honor to serve and privilege to serve as CEO and support of our incredible employees and shareholders for nearly 7 years. We've built an incredibly strong Company over the past 12 years and I'm thankful to have been a part of it. I've enjoyed getting to know all of you and working with you. And we remain very optimistic about the future of LYB. Thank you and best wishes to all of you. We're now adjourned."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell\u2019s second quarter 2021 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bhav Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by revealing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings which are available at our Investor Relations website. Additional documents on our Investor Relations website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures together with other disclosures including the earnings release. Finally, I would like to point out that a recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 PM Eastern Time today until August 30 by calling 877-660-6853 in United States and 201-612-7415 outside United States. The passcode for both numbers is 13721413. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, the current environment, our near-term outlook and provide an update on our growth initiatives. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results in some cases, excluding the impact of lower cost or market inventory adjustments or LCM. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Bhav.\nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Before we begin with the business discussion, I would like to acknowledge the sadness we are feeling throughout the LyondellBasell family after our tragic incident this week at our LaPorte facility, which resulted in the death of two contractors and injuries to several additional contractors and employees. Every day, we work diligently to ensure that the colleagues, the friends and most importantly, the families of our employees and contractors never have to receive the calls that went out last Tuesday evening, notifying them of the loss or injury of a loved one. Our investigation is underway and it will be sometime before we reach a conclusive determination regarding the cause of the incident. Our sincere condolences go out to the families of the two men lost in the incident and we pray for a fast and full recovery for all of the injured.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Bhav. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide Seven and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation, which has been enhanced by our recent growth investments. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the more than $4 billion. Our free operating cash flow yield has been 10.1% over the past four quarters and free operating cash flow for the second quarter, improved by more than 80% relative to the second quarter of 2019. We expect continued improvement of our last 12 months cash flow performance as we move forward through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide Eight and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the second quarter. As I've mentioned, during previous calls, a strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we expressed our confidence in our outlook by increasing the quarterly dividend by 7.6% to $1.13 per share. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects during the quarter with approximately $430 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flow supported debt repayments of $1.3 billion, bringing our year to date debt reduction to $1.8 billion. We closed the second quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.5 billion. Last week S&P global ratings recognized the improvement in our metrics by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. We expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce our net debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. One modeling item of note, our original full year net interest expense guidance of $430 million did not include extinguishment cost associated with our accelerated debt repayment program. As a result, our 2021 net interest expense will likely exceed this prior guidance. Please turn to Slide Nine to review our quarterly profitability. In the second quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered record EBITDA of $3 billion. This was an improvement of more than $1.4 billion relative to the first quarter. Our results reflect robust demand for our products driven by the recovery global economy and our growth investments.\nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 17. In the near to midterm, we are still in the early stages of the global economic recovery and despite the challenges from variance continued progress with vaccinations and reopening should continue to support robust demand and margins for our products. Pent up demand is tangible and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods as reopening proceeds globally. Low inventories due to supply constraints and logistics disruptions will only serve to extend tight market conditions. Downstream customer backlogs and persistent demand bode well for continued strength in LyondellBasell's order books. In polyethylene, strong US and Latin American demand has overtaken volumes that previously flowed from the US to export markets in Asia. As logistics constraints subside and US PV exports to Asia resume, producers will need to refill a depleted supply chain of 500,000 tons or more that is not fully captured in industry statistics. In North America, we expect markets for PV and PP will remain tight into next year. Higher vaccination rates are expected to improve global mobility over the coming year. The return of international travel will drive further recovery and transportation fuel's markets to increase profitability for our Oxyfuels and refining businesses providing additional earnings upside for LyondellBasell. Let me close with Slide 18. Our second quarter results provide clear evidence of LyondellBasell's progress and maximizing cash flow performance through all stages of the business cycle. We are leveraging our leading and advantage positions across a larger asset base to deliver results that far exceed our previous benchmarks. In today's strong markets, our second quarter EBITDA results are 38% higher than our previous record. By 2023, we expect that our recent growth investments will provide an additional $1.5 billion of mid cycle EBITDA earnings capability relative to 2017. Our value-driven growth investments should propel stronger performance in a variety of business environments. Our prudent financial strategy remains consistent. We have increased our quarterly dividend and remain confident in our capability to deliver on this commitment throughout business cycles. We are prioritizing de-leveraging and our rapid progress on debt repayment will serve to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. Capacity expansions are coming online in our industry during a period of extraordinary demand growth and enabling an orderly absorption of this new capacity into the market. Further investments in petrochemicals are proceeding at a manageable rate and recent project cancellations and delays demonstrate capital discipline by market participants. At LyondellBasell, we're focused on providing leadership for our industry to establish a more sustainable feature with new circular business models. We will increase our capacity to serve the growing market demand for circulum branded polymers produced from recycled and renewable feed stocks as we work toward our goal of annually producing two million tons of these products by 2030. LyondellBasell is capturing the strength of a rebounding economy. We aim to extend our track record of robust returns from our growing global business portfolio and look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming quarters. We're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question.  Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks. Thanks very much. At the end of the first quarter, Bob, you talked about how low your inventory is in Europe. Maybe yoU.Said they were 11 days. Can you talk about where your inventory is -- inventory days are now and secondly, have US contract polyethylene prices for July settled, and if they have settled, what was the change?\nBhavesh Patel: All right, good morning, Jeff. Thank you for that question. On inventory, we are starting to restore inventories back to more normal levels. They're better than they were or higher than they were back in Q1, but still not above historic levels and we continue to be hand to mouth on several grades, both in the US and in Europe. They are improving. One other comment about an inventory is that in the U.S in particular, we're not positioned to do a lot of exports. That will require another level of inventory, which we don't have today. So if the inventory situation is improving, not back to historic levels on July contract discussions are still ongoing. Markets are very firm tight. We still have hurricane season in front of us. We have a heavy maintenance schedule in the industry in Q3 and early Q4 in the US. So contract discussions are ongoing and there are more announcements out there for August.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. I'm curious as to how much visibility do you have about inventory levels at your customers and whether, their inventory levels are back to normal or still low or maybe they're starting to run them down. Just curious on that and is there anything structural that precludes your US customers from looking to the international market to fulfil their demand? Is there something that precludes them from really doing that whether it's product quality or the type of material they need from converters, anything that you can comment on that?\nBhavesh Patel: Sure. Steve, good morning. First of all, inventory at customers, it's difficult for us to have exact numbers on that, but I can tell you that when we've had some intermittent unplanned outages recently, we they seem to not have much inventory because before if they're too late, they're very concerned. So anecdotally, I would say there's not much inventory downstream, especially because there's this anticipation of pricing leveling off as well and we've been talking about that for months now and prices continue to rise because of the persistent demand strength. So, all of that says to me customers are not holding an extraordinary amount of inventory when we're late they call us right away. Secondly, your question about imports, historically, and even today imports because of long lead times and generally only the more generic grades are available for import. The imports tend to be limited. Furthermore if you think about today, transportation costs, shipping costs and container costs from Asia to the US basically wipe out the entire arbitrage that exists today in polyethylene price. For example, shipping cost, including container cost is three to four X, what it used to be pre pandemic. So all of that limits the amount of imports that really come in and the customer's ability to import product.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question. \nP.J. Juvekar: Hey, good morning, Bob. I hear your commentary about stronger for longer, but even if one takes a view that this tightness is temporary, maybe lasts for six months to a year ,the free cash flow you will get is real. You almost get $3 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow during this period of tightness. What would you do with that free cash flow? Would you either go towards sort of green projects like CCS or CO2 recycling or hydrogen projects, or B, would you rather go into M&A opportunity? There are a lot of midcap companies in chemical industry that would fit well with your IMD or APS segments. How do you think about allocating this extra free cash flow?\nBhavesh Patel: Excellent. Thank you for that question, PJ. There's a lot there. First of all, you're actually right. There's this debate of where we are in the cycle and whether we're at elevated levels or not. I think there's a couple of points to be made. One is that what's lost in this debate is that LyondellBasell's mid cycle earnings have stepped up. Through the cycle earnings power is up by a $1 billion to $1.1 billion so far in 2021 compared to 2017. And when we have a full year of PO/TBA production in \u201823, that'll add another $400 million to $500 million of it's EBITDA to our earnings power. I think that's very important in terms of through the cycle cash generation ability to pay dividend, fund buybacks in the future all of that. We must not forget that while we continue to debate, are we at peak or not? Secondly, in terms of capital allocation, our first priority is to continue to pay down debt. And Michael talked about that in the prepared remarks about our targets of up to $4 billion of debt reduction this year. We think that's very achievable. We'll continue to update everyone on that. Once we're to that point where we've taken out $4 billion of debt, then I think the whole range of sort of alternatives come into play, continue to strengthen the dividend, think about buybacks, look for deep value, M&A. I think we've demonstrated that that's our focus and stay within the lanes where we swim today. So we'll continue to look for that. In terms of green projects, we're still studying where we can get the most bang for the buck, if you will and I suspect that our CapEx will reflect some of those green investments later in the decade, probably 2025 onwards and I would suspect that will be for a total in the second half of 2021, somewhere in $2 billion to $3 billion range in terms of CapEx in the second half of the decade, not annually, but total for the second half of the decade.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bob Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nBob Koort: Thank you. Good morning. Bhav you've mentioned that the freight rates crowd out in force in the US market. I assume those freight rates are a friction point on exports. So you had mentioned that maybe there could be more demand than we've seen and I presume part of that would be into the export markets. So how do you think it all plays out? I was looking this morning, it looks like export prices are now $0.15, $0.20 less than domestic prices for well molding polyethylene. So you have to give in on price in order to move that volume as inventories rebuild due to maybe offshore prices have to come up towards US prices. How do yoU.See that dynamic playing out?\nBhavesh Patel: Yeah. Great question, Bob. So first of all, historically, even pre-pandemic freight rates coming from Asia to the US were always higher than flag rates going out of US to Asia because of the backhaul sort of concept on product going out. Typically we would pay about $40 per ton excluding packaging, just freight to get polyethylene for example, from the Gulf Coast to the Asia. Today, that's probably double. It's not really limited in terms of exports. Frankly, we just don't have enough production today to be able to export spot volume to Asia. We are doing some exports that are more contract oriented down to Latin America. We have some contract commitments, even in Asia that we continue to fulfil, but we're not quite back in that mode. Certainly as a company, we're not a where we're looking for spot volume going to Asia. And I think as, as the year progresses and some of these bottlenecks around shipping relieve themselves, I don't see that as being a challenge and over time as that happens, I think the price in China should start to come up as their ability to export finished goods improves. And I think the world will kind of equilibrate with China prices coming up as these shipping constraints relieve themselves.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Hey, good morning. Nice quarter guys. When I think about your profitability heading into the second half of the year, given I think your outlook tends to be little bit more positive than the consultants. Do you think your margins will continue to improve sequentially?\nBhavesh Patel: Yeah. Good morning, Mike. So first of all, with all due respect to all of the prognosticators they've underestimated demand consistently over the last year and my comment about demand being stronger for longer, and I think that's really played out. And we've been talking about that since the last earnings call. I think that'll continue. If you think about it, we still have global reopening in front of us. So many durable goods that are on back order automobiles, appliances furniture I could go on and on many value chains are still very low on inventory, down through finished goods. So that needs to get rebuilt. And then for us as a company will benefit as mobility increases. So, when you think about all those factors, it's hard to imagine that demand would weaken in the second half of the year. Now we do have some other forces at play. We have feed stocks with coming up with it, with natural gas in the US coming up. Frac spreads haven't really opened up, but feedstocks are coming up but my sense is in this kind of market environment, there's some ability to pass some of that through. As a company, we have some planned and unplanned outages here in Q3? So, we don't guide on earnings, but if I think about Q3 versus Q2, we should have another very strong quarter in Q3. Remains to be seen if we can get to a record level like we did in Q2, but certainly very strong and well above prior records, that's how yoU.Should think about Q3 and in Q4, we'll have some seasonality, but still from a historic perspective, Q4 will be well above historic Q4 levels. So, hope that helps you in thinking through second half earnings for us.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning, Bhav, I was wondering if you could update us on your outlook for the propylene chain and specifically speak to polypropylene inventories. I think you mentioned a few times that you're seeing a substantial order backlog for durable goods. Looks like PP producers ran pretty hard in the quarter. How do yoU.See inventories on that chain and what implications do yoU.See for polypropylene prices versus monomer as we move forward through the back half of the year?\nBhavesh Patel: All right, thanks, Kevin. So I see continued strength and I think as durables strengthen and especially auto because, that is one of the larger end uses for polypropylene. For us inventories are still low and they're actually tighter on polypropylene than they are on polyethylene. We're kind of hand to mouth and we've had the lightning strike at Lake Charles, which set us back about a week or a week or two and so we're very tight on polypropylene and for the most part, we're managing to contract minimums with our customers. As some of these bottlenecks relieve themselves for auto production, that's just going to make the market tighter and then appliances, those are big draws on polypropylene. So, my outlook is that polypropylene is going to be tight through the rest of the year and by the way, the other benefit that we're waiting to see is in APS segment with the auto sector being sluggish because of the chip shortage. We're not seeing the full earnings power of APS just yet and that's a very significant part of the APS segment our service of the automotive market. So I think polypropylene is going to be very strong. I think propylene is going to be a persistently high for the foreseeable future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question.\nFrank Mitsch: Yes, good morning. And let me offer my condolences as well. Looking at the business I was struck by the comment that your August order book on polyethylene is the best that it's been in any other months of the year. How anomalous is that? And do you have people on 100% order allocation? How are you dealing with it? As I think about your volumes, the second quarter polyethylene volumes were basically flat with the first quarter, what are your thoughts on the third quarter polyethylene volumes? If you could dig into that a little bit, that'd be helpful.\nBhavesh Patel: Sure. Frank, and thank you for your words of support. On the August order book comment, I think it's just an indication of us having more volume to sell. We've been constrained all year and, and as we try to inch our inventory back to more normal levels, we can with confidence take on more orders. We're still constrained. So we're not selling polyethylene unconstrained across the system, but there are some grades now where we have enough availability that if a customer wants product, we're able to do it, but it's really great by grades. In some areas we're still a contract minimums. And so, bottom line is Q3 US polyolefin's sales should be higher than Q2 as we produce more and sell more and I hope that that trend continues.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from our Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the results. I just wanted to get your thoughts a little bit more on I&D. Looks like you had a pretty strong performance there. How would you kind of judge the asset sales chain as well as propylene oxide over the next, say two to four quarters? Yeah, thanks.\nBhavesh Patel: So on this propylene oxide demand is extremely strong. Margins are very, very strong there. We could sell more if we had it frankly. I expect that to continue again, coming back to my earlier comments about furniture shortages that play right into PO also automotive because the seat cushions and all that come from euro . So we see a really good runway for propylene oxide going into the second half of the year and into even next year. Frankly, if the rate command is growing when our plant starts up, we have a decent chance at absorbing a good bit of it right away. And I think it will come on when it's needed. Likewise, an asset  continued strength from housing, yoU.See the paint market being very strong because of home improvement and people buying houses and refurbishing them and so on. So I don't see a letup on either of those. Adding to that Arun, our Oxyfuels business has recovered nicely as we see more mobility around the world and still Europe is in largely in lockdown and I think the best profitability in Oxyfuels is still in front of us and I think that'll help offset any moderation in the O&P area as we see the fuels improving and in Q3, Q4 and into next year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Thanks and good morning. Bhav, wondering if you could give us an update on the molecular recycling initiatives in the Italy plant.\nBhavesh Patel: Sure. Vince. It's coming along very well. We're about to commission a semi works plant here in September. And that'll be the next stage of development of that technology, where we continue to be very encouraged by the results we've seen at the bench scale. And we'll know within a couple of months what the bottlenecks are in that technology and my hope is that later in '22 and into '23, we're prepared to make an investment decision on a medium scale molecular recycling plant, which could be in production in '25 plus or minus.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Hassan Ahmed with Olympic Global. Please proceed with your question. Good morning,\nHassan Ahmed: Bhav, wanted to revisit some of your comments about the I&D segment. Obviously, similar to most businesses, 2020 was a bit rough, but, nice bump up, back to correlate the runway to $600 million in EBITDA. And historically you've talked about the I&D segment being a pretty steady and as I sort of sit there and think about that and the steadiness of the earnings trajectory and some of the comments you made from the sounds of it, it seems that maybe, the earnings on a quarterly basis is maybe even north of $700 million on a steady eddie. So call it almost $3 billion and steady eddie EBITDA and from that from that segment. Is that the right way to think about it?\nBhavesh Patel: Well, one thing that we didn't experience in the past was a complete shutdown of global economy and that caused more volatility in I&D because of the Oxy fuels. Typically it's been very stable. I think today with the assets we have, yoU.Should still think about I&D as a $1.5 billion plus or minus 15%. And then as we add to PO TBA project, we should be able to be consistently above $2 billion in I&D with upside when markets are strong, like they are today and that's how yoU.Should think about earnings power. $1.5, maybe, plus to $1.7 in that range plus or minus and then after the PO TBA project mid cycle consistently above $2 billion and in periods like this well, well above,\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. Thank\nDavid Begleiter: Bhav. Just on refinery, do you think it can still be breakeven in Q3. And give me a comment about, be potentially profitable in Q4. How do you think about that business in 2022? Thank you.\nBhavesh Patel: Thanks David. So on the refinery, I think we need a reset and rens frankly that would help a lot to get to breakeven. And as mobility increases, I think we have a good shot of Q4 being in the black. It really depends on how this variant plays out there. As you think about our company that most parts of the company have shown very good resilience through the pandemic. In fact, strengths in areas like packaging the refinery has been challenged not only from a demand standpoint, but the light heavy differential narrowing. I think we can get too close to break even here in Q3. We need a rens reset and in Q4, certainly we should be in the black.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question\nJohn Roberts: Income from equity investments, doubled sequentially from the first quarter. What's the EBITDA equivalent of that $285 million in equity income and maybe you could unpack for us a little bit, the sequential improvement between Sasol Bora and POJ please?\nBhavesh Patel: Well, there's a lot there, and I'll probably ask you to follow up with Dave afterwards on some of the details. But let me just talk about a couple of the JVs. So first of all, our Saudi JVs remembered that the cracker is an ethane cracker and that's a big driver and as oil price rises and as prices go up globally on polyethylene that JV tends to do very well. That's a big contributor to the increase in earnings from the existing JVs and then the Sasol JV has done extremely well with the merchant ethylene that we sell from that JB and the ethane to polyethylene cash margins being where they are today. Between operating cash flow and the expected tax refund on that investment, we expect to recover our get back up half of our investment in 2021. So that's been a big driver and then incrementally all the other JVs has contributed to the improvement, but I would say the Saudi JVs and the Sasol JV were probably the largest contributor in the increase and the Sasol JV being brand new that was not in our P&L for most of last year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jaideep Pandya with On Field Research. Please proceed with your question.\nJaideep Pandya: Just a question really, around your volumes in Q2, what was sort of constraining you because if I look at polyethylene polypropylene, both in the U.S and Europe  volume in the quarter and then just a little bit more longer term question when we think about your businesses, which are your businesses, which you think have sort of room to grow in spreads as well as volumes as the economy reopens in 2022 and 2023 and, people drive more, fly more, etcetera. Thanks.\nBhavesh Patel: So Jaideep, first of all on volume constraints in Q2, remember we still had some pleas impacts early in Q2 here in the US and then, we've had some unplanned downtime in the polymers. But sequentially, we were able to build a bit of inventory and believe we, we had pretty good production. So I think the headline there's a lot underneath the details in which product lines were higher or lower. My sense is that the fuels part of the business was still a bit weak in Q2, but the polymers and the PO was very strong in production in Q2. And certainly up compared to Q1 going forward, you asked about which product lines have the most potential for spread and volume improvement indefinitely it's in fuels. I do think there's incremental potential in spread improvement and in, in the polymers area globally, but where I think we have the greatest opportunity for a step up in volume and, and spread is in Oxyfuels and in gasoline and distillate here in the U.S and then we hope that will be very meaningful as we work through Q3 and certainly into Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Company. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Blair: Good Morning, Bava. Sorry to hear about the accident. I had a question on the renewable side, so you have several initiatives on the table. I think it's probably fair to say that Lyondell is one of the leaders in this area, but at the same time, investors have a hard time gauging just how meaningful these projects might be for such a large company. So could you help put that into perspective as you look at like CCP or more tech or circulation what are you most excited about and, and what is the potential to really move the needle for you? \nBhavesh Patel: Sure.Thank you, Matthew. And I appreciate your words of support. Yeah, I mean, that's I have these conversations with investors often and that this is going to build momentum over the decade. First of all, we called that our goal is to have about -- about 2 million tons of recycled or renewable based plastics by the end of the decade, by, by 2030, we think that'll probably represent about 15% of our production. I mean, think about our work on MarTech, as well, as on circularity on QCP mechanical recycling and the circulum brand in particular, that's all part of our polyolefin franchise and given our, our capabilities in research and development application development we're leading in this area in circularity and we'll continue to it's just part of the polyolefin businesses, how I was thinking about it. Not, not some separate significant step up in earnings, but it's part of making the polyolefin business work. Long-Term\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Jonathan Elvers with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Elvers: Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Really appreciate the focus on de-leveraging and the very good progress you've made there year-to-date. And I guess, as it relates to the $4 billion net debt reduction target that you've referenced is a net target. I'm curious, kind of how you think about paying down for debt versus just building cash on the balance sheet and in the case of the former possibly where within the debt capital structure you think about targeting? Thanks.\nBhavesh Patel: Yeah. I'll ask Michael to respond to that question.\nMichael McMurray: Sure. Great. So, so great question, may be just a couple of points. What I, what I would say is that our overall maturity profile is in great shape, especially after all the actions that we took in 2020. Actually our weighted average maturity is about 16 years as we sit here today and we don't have any significant near-term maturities on a, on a year-to-day basis we've taken out $8 billion that was done through our term loan and some of our 2023. We have the ability to further de-leverage in the second half of the year with the $650 million of callable notes that we have as well. So that's -- that's obviously something that is in a prime focus. And then lastly we typically have a bit of commercial paper that's outstanding that we can, that we can use to deliver. And then we're contemplating potentially doing a tender as well again in the second half of the year. And then just from a from a targeting point of view kind of through the cycle our total debt to EBITDA target is about one and a half to two and a half times. And so quite frankly, as we're progressing through this year, we're in, we're in great shape from that perspective, as well as evidenced by the upgrade that we received a week a week ago from S&P.\nJonathan Elvers: Great, thank you, Michael and Jonathan let's see how the year progresses when we get this $4 billion put away. Let's let's continue the dialogue on capital allocation. I think we've proven over the years that we've been very disciplined in this area, and you should continue to expect that from us.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question and answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Bhavesh Patel for closing remarks.\nBhavesh Patel: All right. Thank you, Alex. In Q2 2021, LyondellBasell has demonstrated its turbocharged earnings power in a very strong market environment and a larger company going forward. We expect demand to remain strong is as mentioned throughout this call with reopening still ahead of us in many parts of the world backlogs and many product areas that has to be relieved, inventory restocking and increase mobility. We had lined Elvis LR really well positioned to significantly strengthen our investment grade balance sheet, pay down debt and to capitalize on a stronger for longer market environment. The main points that I hope investors got out of the call today is that we've whether where we can debate about where we are in the cycle. LyondellBasell have increased our earnings power through the cycle by more than $1 billion to date compared to 2017. And after our PO/TBA project is online, we'll add another $500 million of EBITDA in earnings power. All of that should provide for very robust cash flow, which will deploy in a very disciplined way to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you for your interest and hope you all have a great weekend.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect your lines and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bhavesh Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave. Good day to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Before we begin with the business discussion, I would like to acknowledge the sadness we are feeling throughout the LyondellBasell family after our tragic incident this week at our LaPorte facility, which resulted in the death of two contractors and injuries to several additional contractors and employees. Every day, we work diligently to ensure that the colleagues, the friends and most importantly, the families of our employees and contractors never have to receive the calls that went out last Tuesday evening, notifying them of the loss or injury of a loved one. Our investigation is underway and it will be sometime before we reach a conclusive determination regarding the cause of the incident. Our sincere condolences go out to the families of the two men lost in the incident and we pray for a fast and full recovery for all of the injured. Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 17. In the near to midterm, we are still in the early stages of the global economic recovery and despite the challenges from variance continued progress with vaccinations and reopening should continue to support robust demand and margins for our products. Pent up demand is tangible and consumers have ample liquidity to drive purchases of both services and manufactured goods as reopening proceeds globally. Low inventories due to supply constraints and logistics disruptions will only serve to extend tight market conditions. Downstream customer backlogs and persistent demand bode well for continued strength in LyondellBasell's order books. In polyethylene, strong US and Latin American demand has overtaken volumes that previously flowed from the US to export markets in Asia. As logistics constraints subside and US PV exports to Asia resume, producers will need to refill a depleted supply chain of 500,000 tons or more that is not fully captured in industry statistics. In North America, we expect markets for PV and PP will remain tight into next year. Higher vaccination rates are expected to improve global mobility over the coming year. The return of international travel will drive further recovery and transportation fuel's markets to increase profitability for our Oxyfuels and refining businesses providing additional earnings upside for LyondellBasell. Let me close with Slide 18. Our second quarter results provide clear evidence of LyondellBasell's progress and maximizing cash flow performance through all stages of the business cycle. We are leveraging our leading and advantage positions across a larger asset base to deliver results that far exceed our previous benchmarks. In today's strong markets, our second quarter EBITDA results are 38% higher than our previous record. By 2023, we expect that our recent growth investments will provide an additional $1.5 billion of mid cycle EBITDA earnings capability relative to 2017. Our value-driven growth investments should propel stronger performance in a variety of business environments. Our prudent financial strategy remains consistent. We have increased our quarterly dividend and remain confident in our capability to deliver on this commitment throughout business cycles. We are prioritizing de-leveraging and our rapid progress on debt repayment will serve to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. Capacity expansions are coming online in our industry during a period of extraordinary demand growth and enabling an orderly absorption of this new capacity into the market. Further investments in petrochemicals are proceeding at a manageable rate and recent project cancellations and delays demonstrate capital discipline by market participants. At LyondellBasell, we're focused on providing leadership for our industry to establish a more sustainable feature with new circular business models. We will increase our capacity to serve the growing market demand for circulum branded polymers produced from recycled and renewable feed stocks as we work toward our goal of annually producing two million tons of these products by 2030. LyondellBasell is capturing the strength of a rebounding economy. We aim to extend our track record of robust returns from our growing global business portfolio and look forward to updating you on our progress over the coming quarters. We're now pleased to take your questions. All right, good morning, Jeff. Thank you for that question. On inventory, we are starting to restore inventories back to more normal levels. They're better than they were or higher than they were back in Q1, but still not above historic levels and we continue to be hand to mouth on several grades, both in the US and in Europe. They are improving. One other comment about an inventory is that in the U.S in particular, we're not positioned to do a lot of exports. That will require another level of inventory, which we don't have today. So if the inventory situation is improving, not back to historic levels on July contract discussions are still ongoing. Markets are very firm tight. We still have hurricane season in front of us. We have a heavy maintenance schedule in the industry in Q3 and early Q4 in the US. So contract discussions are ongoing and there are more announcements out there for August. Sure. Steve, good morning. First of all, inventory at customers, it's difficult for us to have exact numbers on that, but I can tell you that when we've had some intermittent unplanned outages recently, we they seem to not have much inventory because before if they're too late, they're very concerned. So anecdotally, I would say there's not much inventory downstream, especially because there's this anticipation of pricing leveling off as well and we've been talking about that for months now and prices continue to rise because of the persistent demand strength. So, all of that says to me customers are not holding an extraordinary amount of inventory when we're late they call us right away. Secondly, your question about imports, historically, and even today imports because of long lead times and generally only the more generic grades are available for import. The imports tend to be limited. Furthermore if you think about today, transportation costs, shipping costs and container costs from Asia to the US basically wipe out the entire arbitrage that exists today in polyethylene price. For example, shipping cost, including container cost is three to four X, what it used to be pre pandemic. So all of that limits the amount of imports that really come in and the customer's ability to import product. Excellent. Thank you for that question, PJ. There's a lot there. First of all, you're actually right. There's this debate of where we are in the cycle and whether we're at elevated levels or not. I think there's a couple of points to be made. One is that what's lost in this debate is that LyondellBasell's mid cycle earnings have stepped up. Through the cycle earnings power is up by a $1 billion to $1.1 billion so far in 2021 compared to 2017. And when we have a full year of PO/TBA production in \u201823, that'll add another $400 million to $500 million of it's EBITDA to our earnings power. I think that's very important in terms of through the cycle cash generation ability to pay dividend, fund buybacks in the future all of that. We must not forget that while we continue to debate, are we at peak or not? Secondly, in terms of capital allocation, our first priority is to continue to pay down debt. And Michael talked about that in the prepared remarks about our targets of up to $4 billion of debt reduction this year. We think that's very achievable. We'll continue to update everyone on that. Once we're to that point where we've taken out $4 billion of debt, then I think the whole range of sort of alternatives come into play, continue to strengthen the dividend, think about buybacks, look for deep value, M&A. I think we've demonstrated that that's our focus and stay within the lanes where we swim today. So we'll continue to look for that. In terms of green projects, we're still studying where we can get the most bang for the buck, if you will and I suspect that our CapEx will reflect some of those green investments later in the decade, probably 2025 onwards and I would suspect that will be for a total in the second half of 2021, somewhere in $2 billion to $3 billion range in terms of CapEx in the second half of the decade, not annually, but total for the second half of the decade. Yeah. Great question, Bob. So first of all, historically, even pre-pandemic freight rates coming from Asia to the US were always higher than flag rates going out of US to Asia because of the backhaul sort of concept on product going out. Typically we would pay about $40 per ton excluding packaging, just freight to get polyethylene for example, from the Gulf Coast to the Asia. Today, that's probably double. It's not really limited in terms of exports. Frankly, we just don't have enough production today to be able to export spot volume to Asia. We are doing some exports that are more contract oriented down to Latin America. We have some contract commitments, even in Asia that we continue to fulfil, but we're not quite back in that mode. Certainly as a company, we're not a where we're looking for spot volume going to Asia. And I think as, as the year progresses and some of these bottlenecks around shipping relieve themselves, I don't see that as being a challenge and over time as that happens, I think the price in China should start to come up as their ability to export finished goods improves. And I think the world will kind of equilibrate with China prices coming up as these shipping constraints relieve themselves. Yeah. Good morning, Mike. So first of all, with all due respect to all of the prognosticators they've underestimated demand consistently over the last year and my comment about demand being stronger for longer, and I think that's really played out. And we've been talking about that since the last earnings call. I think that'll continue. If you think about it, we still have global reopening in front of us. So many durable goods that are on back order automobiles, appliances furniture I could go on and on many value chains are still very low on inventory, down through finished goods. So that needs to get rebuilt. And then for us as a company will benefit as mobility increases. So, when you think about all those factors, it's hard to imagine that demand would weaken in the second half of the year. Now we do have some other forces at play. We have feed stocks with coming up with it, with natural gas in the US coming up. Frac spreads haven't really opened up, but feedstocks are coming up but my sense is in this kind of market environment, there's some ability to pass some of that through. As a company, we have some planned and unplanned outages here in Q3? So, we don't guide on earnings, but if I think about Q3 versus Q2, we should have another very strong quarter in Q3. Remains to be seen if we can get to a record level like we did in Q2, but certainly very strong and well above prior records, that's how yoU.Should think about Q3 and in Q4, we'll have some seasonality, but still from a historic perspective, Q4 will be well above historic Q4 levels. So, hope that helps you in thinking through second half earnings for us. All right, thanks, Kevin. So I see continued strength and I think as durables strengthen and especially auto because, that is one of the larger end uses for polypropylene. For us inventories are still low and they're actually tighter on polypropylene than they are on polyethylene. We're kind of hand to mouth and we've had the lightning strike at Lake Charles, which set us back about a week or a week or two and so we're very tight on polypropylene and for the most part, we're managing to contract minimums with our customers. As some of these bottlenecks relieve themselves for auto production, that's just going to make the market tighter and then appliances, those are big draws on polypropylene. So, my outlook is that polypropylene is going to be tight through the rest of the year and by the way, the other benefit that we're waiting to see is in APS segment with the auto sector being sluggish because of the chip shortage. We're not seeing the full earnings power of APS just yet and that's a very significant part of the APS segment our service of the automotive market. So I think polypropylene is going to be very strong. I think propylene is going to be a persistently high for the foreseeable future. Sure. Frank, and thank you for your words of support. On the August order book comment, I think it's just an indication of us having more volume to sell. We've been constrained all year and, and as we try to inch our inventory back to more normal levels, we can with confidence take on more orders. We're still constrained. So we're not selling polyethylene unconstrained across the system, but there are some grades now where we have enough availability that if a customer wants product, we're able to do it, but it's really great by grades. In some areas we're still a contract minimums. And so, bottom line is Q3 US polyolefin's sales should be higher than Q2 as we produce more and sell more and I hope that that trend continues. So on this propylene oxide demand is extremely strong. Margins are very, very strong there. We could sell more if we had it frankly. I expect that to continue again, coming back to my earlier comments about furniture shortages that play right into PO also automotive because the seat cushions and all that come from euro . So we see a really good runway for propylene oxide going into the second half of the year and into even next year. Frankly, if the rate command is growing when our plant starts up, we have a decent chance at absorbing a good bit of it right away. And I think it will come on when it's needed. Likewise, an asset  continued strength from housing, yoU.See the paint market being very strong because of home improvement and people buying houses and refurbishing them and so on. So I don't see a letup on either of those. Adding to that Arun, our Oxyfuels business has recovered nicely as we see more mobility around the world and still Europe is in largely in lockdown and I think the best profitability in Oxyfuels is still in front of us and I think that'll help offset any moderation in the O&P area as we see the fuels improving and in Q3, Q4 and into next year. Sure. Vince. It's coming along very well. We're about to commission a semi works plant here in September. And that'll be the next stage of development of that technology, where we continue to be very encouraged by the results we've seen at the bench scale. And we'll know within a couple of months what the bottlenecks are in that technology and my hope is that later in '22 and into '23, we're prepared to make an investment decision on a medium scale molecular recycling plant, which could be in production in '25 plus or minus. Well, one thing that we didn't experience in the past was a complete shutdown of global economy and that caused more volatility in I&D because of the Oxy fuels. Typically it's been very stable. I think today with the assets we have, yoU.Should still think about I&D as a $1.5 billion plus or minus 15%. And then as we add to PO TBA project, we should be able to be consistently above $2 billion in I&D with upside when markets are strong, like they are today and that's how yoU.Should think about earnings power. $1.5, maybe, plus to $1.7 in that range plus or minus and then after the PO TBA project mid cycle consistently above $2 billion and in periods like this well, well above, Thanks David. So on the refinery, I think we need a reset and rens frankly that would help a lot to get to breakeven. And as mobility increases, I think we have a good shot of Q4 being in the black. It really depends on how this variant plays out there. As you think about our company that most parts of the company have shown very good resilience through the pandemic. In fact, strengths in areas like packaging the refinery has been challenged not only from a demand standpoint, but the light heavy differential narrowing.

But sequentially, we were able to build a bit of inventory and believe we, we had pretty good production. So I think the headline there's a lot underneath the details in which product lines were higher or lower. My sense is that the fuels part of the business was still a bit weak in Q2, but the polymers and the PO was very strong in production in Q2. And certainly up compared to Q1 going forward, you asked about which product lines have the most potential for spread and volume improvement indefinitely it's in fuels. I do think there's incremental potential in spread improvement and in, in the polymers area globally, but where I think we have the greatest opportunity for a step up in volume and, and spread is in Oxyfuels and in gasoline and distillate here in the U.S and then we hope that will be very meaningful as we work through Q3 and certainly into Q4. Sure.Thank you, Matthew. And I appreciate your words of support. Yeah, I mean, that's I have these conversations with investors often and that this is going to build momentum over the decade. First of all, we called that our goal is to have about -- about 2 million tons of recycled or renewable based plastics by the end of the decade, by, by 2030, we think that'll probably represent about 15% of our production. I mean, think about our work on MarTech, as well, as on circularity on QCP mechanical recycling and the circulum brand in particular, that's all part of our polyolefin franchise and given our, our capabilities in research and development application development we're leading in this area in circularity and we'll continue to it's just part of the polyolefin businesses, how I was thinking about it. Not, not some separate significant step up in earnings, but it's part of making the polyolefin business work. Long-Term Yeah. I'll ask Michael to respond to that question. All right. Thank you, Alex. In Q2 2021, LyondellBasell has demonstrated its turbocharged earnings power in a very strong market environment and a larger company going forward. We expect demand to remain strong is as mentioned throughout this call with reopening still ahead of us in many parts of the world backlogs and many product areas that has to be relieved, inventory restocking and increase mobility. We had lined Elvis LR really well positioned to significantly strengthen our investment grade balance sheet, pay down debt and to capitalize on a stronger for longer market environment. The main points that I hope investors got out of the call today is that we've whether where we can debate about where we are in the cycle. LyondellBasell have increased our earnings power through the cycle by more than $1 billion to date compared to 2017. And after our PO/TBA project is online, we'll add another $500 million of EBITDA in earnings power. All of that should provide for very robust cash flow, which will deploy in a very disciplined way to the benefit of our shareholders. Thank you for your interest and hope you all have a great weekend."

            "content": "Thank you, Bhav. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide Seven and let me begin by highlighting our strong cash generation, which has been enhanced by our recent growth investments. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.9 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards the more than $4 billion. Our free operating cash flow yield has been 10.1% over the past four quarters and free operating cash flow for the second quarter, improved by more than 80% relative to the second quarter of 2019. We expect continued improvement of our last 12 months cash flow performance as we move forward through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide Eight and review the details of our cash generation and deployment during the second quarter. As I've mentioned, during previous calls, a strong and progressive dividend plays a fundamental role in our capital deployment strategy. In the second quarter, we expressed our confidence in our outlook by increasing the quarterly dividend by 7.6% to $1.13 per share. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects during the quarter with approximately $430 million in capital expenditures. Strong cash flow supported debt repayments of $1.3 billion, bringing our year to date debt reduction to $1.8 billion. We closed the second quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.5 billion. Last week S&P global ratings recognized the improvement in our metrics by upgrading our credit ratings and indicating a stable outlook. We expect that robust cash generation and an anticipated tax refund will enable continued progress on our goal to reduce our net debt by up to $4 billion during 2021 and further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. One modeling item of note, our original full year net interest expense guidance of $430 million did not include extinguishment cost associated with our accelerated debt repayment program. As a result, our 2021 net interest expense will likely exceed this prior guidance. Please turn to Slide Nine to review our quarterly profitability. In the second quarter of 2021, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered record EBITDA of $3 billion. This was an improvement of more than $1.4 billion relative to the first quarter. Our results reflect robust demand for our products driven by the recovery global economy and our growth investments. Sure. Great. So, so great question, may be just a couple of points. What I, what I would say is that our overall maturity profile is in great shape, especially after all the actions that we took in 2020. Actually our weighted average maturity is about 16 years as we sit here today and we don't have any significant near-term maturities on a, on a year-to-day basis we've taken out $8 billion that was done through our term loan and some of our 2023. We have the ability to further de-leverage in the second half of the year with the $650 million of callable notes that we have as well. So that's -- that's obviously something that is in a prime focus. And then lastly we typically have a bit of commercial paper that's outstanding that we can, that we can use to deliver. And then we're contemplating potentially doing a tender as well again in the second half of the year. And then just from a from a targeting point of view kind of through the cycle our total debt to EBITDA target is about one and a half to two and a half times. And so quite frankly, as we're progressing through this year, we're in, we're in great shape from that perspective, as well as evidenced by the upgrade that we received a week a week ago from S&P."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator. Hello and welcome to LyondellBasell first quarter 2021 teleconference. I'm joined today by Bhav Patel, our Chief Executive Officer; and Michael McMurray, our Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin the business discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures.\nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. Before we get into the discussion of our results, I would like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous progress that has been made in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and how much hard work still needs to be done around the world to reduce the effects of this disease. While financial markets are focused on the economic upside being enabled by increased vaccination and the eventual reopening, today our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities where we operate in India in particular as well as Brazil and even parts of Europe are still suffering from terribly high case rates and fatalities. We are working closely with governments around the world to do our part to advance immunity for our employees and their communities and to hasten and end to the devastation brought on by this virus. Our thoughts remain with those most affected by this pandemic.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Bhav and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 and let me begin by highlighting our track record of strong cash conversion. Over the last 12 months, LyondellBasell converted almost 80% of her EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. In the first quarter of 2021, our business has delivered over 40% more free operating cash flow relative to the same period last year. We expect continued improvement of our LCM performance as we progressed through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide 11 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment during the first quarter. As Bhav mentioned, our goal for this year is to accomplish meaningful deleveraging to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. In the first quarter, while paying dividends of $352 million and investing a similar amount in capital expenditures, we reduced the balance on our term loan by $500 million to close the first quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.8 billion. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $500 million on the term loan in April. We expect that robust cash generation should enable continued progress on deleveraging throughout the year. Before I continue with a more detailed discussion of our segment results, let me provide a brief update on our 2021 modeling guidance. We continue to be on track to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021. Target equally towards profit generating growth projects and sustaining maintenance. Due to extremely strong demand for propylene oxide, we have shifted a turnaround at one of our PO/TBA units in Bayport, Texas from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year and reduced the scope and associated downtime for the maintenance. With this change, we expect no major planned maintenance downtime in the second quarter of 2021 and based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that the third quarter EBITDA impact due to lost production associated with planned maintenance across the company will increase by $30 million to $75 million. In total, the impact associated with all of LyondellBasell\u2019s 2021 planned maintenance downtime should decreased by $30 million relative to our original guidance to approximately $140 million for the year. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our quarterly profitability. In the first quarter of 2021 LyondellBasell\u2019s business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $1.6 billion. This was an improvement of more than $300 million relative to the fourth quarter, exceeding typical first quarter seasonal trends. The upward trajectory of LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability reflects improving demand and margins for products driven by the recovery global economy and tight markets. As Bob mentioned, cold weather and associated power outages resulted in unplanned shutdowns that constrained first quarter production for LyondellBasell and nearly all of our competitors in the state of Texas. This downturn was exacerbated by strong global demand that tightened markets and elevated margins across most of our businesses. While it's clear that we lost production during the first quarter due to unplanned downtime, the offsetting effects of higher margins and sales from inventory complicates the effort to quantify the impact on first quarter business results. In the second quarter, we plan to operate our assets at nearly full rates as profitability improves for Oxyfuels and Refining businesses. We expect further EBITDA improvement during the second quarter. On the left side of the chart, our all-time high quarterly EBITDA excluding LCM of approximately $2.2 billion reported in the third quarter of 2015 provides useful perspective. While profitability for transportation fuels was quite strong in 2015, today our company has more earnings power from a larger asset base. Over the last six years, we have added ethylene capacity at Corpus Christi, expanded our compounding business to the acquisition of A. Schulman, started a new Hyperzone HDPE plant in Houston and added significant joint venture capacity in Louisiana and China. In 2021, LyondellBasell is poised to capture opportunities that are emerging in the rebounding global economy with a larger asset base. Now, let's review the first quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results excluding the non-cash impacts of LCM inventory changes. I will begin with our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 13. Third quarter EBITDA was $867 million, $145 million higher than the fourth quarter. Tight markets and strong demand resulted in improved margins driving quarter results higher than we've seen since 2015. Olefin results increased approximately $155 million compared to the fourth quarter. Olefin\u2019s margins increased with higher ethylene and propylene prices outpacing higher feedstock and utility costs. Volumes decreased due to downtime driven by Texas weather events partially offset by a full quarter of volume from our Louisiana joint venture that we formed in December. The ethylene cracker at the joint venture ran continuously throughout the weather events and exceeded ethylene nameplate operating rates by 9% during March. Polyolefin results for the segment decreased by about $15 million during the first quarter. Polyethylene margin decreased while polypropylene margin improved. Polyethylene volume increased due to a full quarter of contribution from the Louisiana joint venture, partially offset by lost production during the weather events. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P Americas segment during the second quarter. Volumes are expected to rebound in the absence of weather-related downtime. Tight markets due to high demand, low inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue to support strong integrated chain margins. Now, please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and international segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $412 million, $161 million higher than the fourth quarter. Strong demand, expanded margins driving quarterly results higher than we have seen for the segment since 2018. Olefins results increased $30 million driven by increased margins and volumes. Ethylene margin improved due to increased ethylene prices and lower fixed costs despite higher feedstock costs. Demand was robust during the quarter and we increased volumes by operating our crackers at a rate of 98% almost 10% above industry benchmarks for the first quarter.  Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $150 million compared to the prior quarter. Strong polymer demand drove spread improvements for both polyethylene and polypropylene prices relative to monomer. Margin improvements at our Middle East and Asia joint ventures were offset by higher LPG feedstock costs, pressuring profitability at our new joint venture in China resulted in little change in equity income for the segment. During the second quarter, we expect strong demand and tight markets to drive further margin improvement for O&P-EAI businesses. Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $182 million, $14 million lower than the prior quarter. Margins improved with higher product prices while volumes declined due to the Texas weather events and planned maintenance in our propylene oxide and derivatives business. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results decreased by approximately $35 million due to lower volumes offsetting stronger margins driven by tight market supply. Intermediate chemical results decreased about $55 million due to lower volumes as a result of the weather events. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by approximately $25 million as a result of higher margins benefiting from improved gasoline prices that were partially offset by constrained volumes. We expect both volumes and margins to improve for our I&D segment in the second quarter. Strong demand for durable goods coupled with continued tight market supply are expected to increase profitability across most of the businesses in the segment. Now, let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $135 million, $9 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes improved driven by higher demand for our products partially offset by lower margins. Compounding and solution results were relatively unchanged with higher volumes driven by improved demand being offset by compressed margins due to rising feedstock costs. Advanced polymer results increased by approximately $50 million due to both higher margins and volumes. In April, North American feedstock costs for our polypropylene compounds rapidly declined to reverse much of the price escalation that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that falling feedstock prices combined with continued price improvements were compounded products will expand margins during the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $110 dollars. A $36 million decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher cost for renewable fuel credits or rens and lower crude throughput overwhelmed improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry crack spread. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $5.21 per barrel to $15.32 per barrel. As a result of the Texas weather event, the average crude throughput at the refinery fell to 152,000 barrels per day. In April, we continue to see improvements in refined product demand and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates. Strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve both volumes and margins at our refinery during the second half of this year. However, we don't expect a full recovery until there is further progress in vaccination rates and a rebound in global demand for jet fuel, driven by increased business and international air travel.  Please turn to Slide 18, as we review the results of our Technology segment. First quarter Technology segment EBITDA was $94 million, $49 million higher than the prior quarter. Catalyst profitability increased with customers rebuilding inventories and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East. Based on anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that second quarter technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bhav.\nBhavesh Patel: Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 19. We began this year with low inventories and increasing demand from a recovering global economy. During our fourth quarter earnings call in January, we thought that strong February order books, increasing seasonal demand, and tight industry supply would support strong margins for at least the first half of 2021. Since January, our industry lost several weeks of supply due to Texas weather events during February and deferred maintenance from 2020 is resulting in high levels of planned downtime across the industry, particularly in the second quarter. North American inventories were depleted during the downtime and European inventories have been pressured by unusually strong first quarter demand. While our company normally maintains over one month of polyolefins sales inventory, our European PE and PP businesses ended March at levels well below those targets, most notably with less than two weeks of low density polyethylene inventory.  Logistics constraints are exacerbating the situation due to shortages of shipping containers on critical routes and escalating freight rates that are limiting opportunities for regional arbitrage. China remains structurally short of polyethylene. And U.S. exports to China have vanished as North American suppliers seek to replenish inventories and address order backlogs from domestic customers. Backlogs for finished goods are rising as the recovering global economy continues to be supported by government stimulus and pent-up demand emerges with increased vaccination rates. In summary, we believe that tight global markets are likely to persist well into the second half of this year and continued improvements in mobility and associated economic activity could sustain strong volumes and margins into 2022. Please turn to Slide 20 and let's review LyondellBasell\u2019s profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. In the years following the 2008 Great Recession, our company nimbly captured the benefits of low cost feedstocks that arose from the development of North American oil and gas resources. LyondellBasell typically delivered between $6 billion to $7 billion of EBITDA over the past 10 years. Our EBITDA after LCM inventory adjustments reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our company. At the end of 2019, we thought we might simply be coming to the end of a very long business cycle, until we learn more about COVID and the extreme tolls it would take on our society, the economy and ultimately in human lives.  As we rebound from the pandemic and contemplate how our company could perform through the recovery in the next business cycle it is worthwhile to consider the factors that should provide additional earnings power relative to our performance last year and in the previous cycle. Recovery in automotive and other durable goods demand is rebuilding volumes within our new APS segment back towards 2018 levels. Increased utilization of our capacity should provide greater visibility on the more than $200 million in synergies that we've built into the business since acquiring A. Schulman. In 2020 we added 500,000 tons of polyethylene capacity utilizing our next generation hyper zone technology. During the depths of the pandemic and recession our strong balance sheet enabled us to move forward and form accretive joint ventures for integrated crackers in China and Louisiana that provided immediate returns on our investments. This quarter we finalized an agreement to form our second propylene oxide joint venture with Sinopec.  Beyond the broad-based margin improvements that are currently underway for many of our products, full recovery and demand for transportation fuels still lies ahead and should drive margin improvement for our sizable refining and oxyfuels businesses over the coming quarters.  Our larger asset base is well-poised to capture the opportunities of a recovering economy, establish new earnings benchmarks, and position LyondellBasell for further growth over the upcoming business cycle.  Coming close with Slide 21. The title of our 2020 annual report is Emerging Stronger and it is an appropriate description of LyondellBasell\u2019s trajectory as the global economy recovers from the pandemic and recession. Our leading and advantaged business positions are primed to capture the benefits of a recovering economy. In the second quarter, we have no measure planned downtime and we are operating our highly reliable and low-cost global network of assets at maximum rates to capture rising margins. We've remained steadfast to our disciplined financial strategy. Over the coming year, our priority will continue to be deleveraging while supporting shareholder returns with a strong and progressive dividend. We remain committed to an investment grade credit rating and our plan is to bolster our credit metrics through increased earnings and additional debt reduction over the coming quarters. Our aim is to maximize free cash flow by leveraging our larger asset base efficiently converting earnings into cash and deploying capital in a prudent manner towards high-return investments. All of this will help drive our ultimate focus on delivering strong shareholder returns. The outlook for our business is quite promising. And we look forward to delivering our commitments over the coming quarters. We're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator:  Our first question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Sir, your line is open.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. If your peak EBITDA in 2015 was $8 billion, what do you think your peak EBITDA is now after you bring on your 2023 expansions?\nMichael McMurray: So, good morning Jeff and for everyone, thanks for your patience with our longer prepared remarks, there's a lot going on. So, we wanted to provide color. So Jeff in terms of peak EBITDA, if you think about the kind of mid-cycle margins up to now we've added between $1 billion and $1.2 billion of EBITDA. In 2023, we\u2019ll add another $500 million with our Sinopec PO-SM project and the PO-TBA project. So, I would say at mid-cycle margins we've added $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of EBITDA. And if you - were to consider peak earnings then it would be something even more than that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Your line is open.\nP.J. Juvekar: First of all, I like your brand names circular and recover, revive - recover, revive and renew. It was very nice.\nBhavesh Patel: Well, thank you.\nP.J. Juvekar: My question is on regular polyethylene. You know you talked a lot about higher polyethylene demand and during COVID time on Slide 9. Can you discuss how much of the capacity - on the capacity side, how much of capacity possibly was delayed due to COVID? Because there are some numbers out there above 1 million to 2 million tons of capacity delayed. And then just any - I saw something in the - news headlines about phase 2 of Bora joint venture. Can you also talk a little bit about that? Thank you.\nBhavesh Patel: Sure, P.J. So, first of all in terms of capacity delays, I think in China we should assume that capacity will come on part of schedule for those projects that are already underway. I think for projects that haven't started in China, certainly the CTO and MTO projects are probably at risk. And we've learned recently that government is considering canceling those projects for the environment. In the U.S. because of COVID, the projects that are underway maybe were delayed a quarter or two especially Q2, Q3 last year. As there were slowdowns until we all figured out how to manage density in our sites and construction sites. So, maybe a couple of quarters for those projects that are underway. And if you think longer term, projects that CTO/MTO based in China could be at risk. Mike?\nMichael McMurray: Oh in Bora, question about Bora phase 2. So we're still discussing with our partner on Bora phase 2. No definitive decisions yet. I would say that would be middle of the decade or beyond in terms of product hitting the market.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.\nSteve Byrne: Yes, thank you. I was curious to hear how your marketing of the polyethylene out of Lake Charles may have changed since it was solely run and managed by Sasol. And maybe more importantly, this broader share position you have in the U.S. market, are you picking up anything from your customer relationships where the industry might be trying to allocate more tons into this premium market to capture that premium versus spot pricing ex-U.S.?\nMichael McMurray: Yes, so good morning Steve. On the Sasol marketing, so pre-pandemic our view was that we would plug that volume into our global network and sell in Europe and in China and also supplement in the U.S. So, that's still our plan. But in the near term, because of the supply disruptions really spot sales have been zero. We've been on allocation. So, exports are only those where we have contracts. We're not doing spot exports. We don't have enough volume today. And our inventories are below our typical levels. So, our focus in the near-term will be to meet domestic demand, which is - which we still don't know what level that demand is, because of the supply constraints. And then, we'll look to resume exports.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.\nArun Viswanathan: Great, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the good results here. Just want to get your thoughts on PE inventories and kind of the outlook for the next couple of quarters. Obviously as you noted, the storm reduced those inventories materially. And how do you see those evolving over the next couple of quarters? When do you expect that we'll be back at normal? And what does that imply for the next couple of price increases that have been announced? Thanks.\nBhavesh Patel: Yes thank you, Arun. First of all in inventory, I was actually just looking at that data this morning. The industry data and industry inventories both PE and PP are below typical levels that we've seen in the past. Again, I think following on from what I answered to Steve earlier, we still don't know what's the level of demand. My guess is the level of demand is higher than what we saw in February and March. And so, our first priority is to meet the demand of our customers and then find the opportunity to rebuild inventory. So, if you think about what's ahead, we still have reopening ahead in the U.S. We are reopening ahead in Europe, many parts of Asia, ex-China still reopening ahead so, stronger demand period. Typically, we see seasonal improvement so opportunity to rebuild inventory, we may not have that until later in Q3. Also recall that there's a lot of planned downtime in the industry because many producers deferred planned maintenance last year into this year. So, I think all of these reasons are why the setup looks to be for a very tight market for most of this year if not all.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from Vertical Research Partners. Sir, your line is open.\nKevin McCarthy: Good morning. Bhav, the spread between polypropylene resin and propylene monomer has widened quite a bit since October. I think $0.21 per pound or so. Perhaps you have a slightly different number. But my question is, what is, the trajectory that you would foresee for that spread moving through the back half of the year? How sustainable is it given the inventory levels that you mentioned and your view of supply demand?\nBhavesh Patel: So, Kevin on polypropylene you know more of it goes into durable goods than does polyethylene. And I'm sure all of our listeners have heard about the shortage of chips that have limited automobile production. I think that's going to cause more demand as some of those constraints relieve themselves and there's more chips available. And generally speaking auto sales are up. Inventories are low. Fleet sales have been low. Rental car fleets have been depleted last year. So, all of that has to be replenished. So, my sense is that polypropylene market will continue to be strong. And if I were to look at inventories the data that I saw this morning from an industry perspective in the U.S. PP inventories are actually lower than PE inventories. And this data that I'm citing is 60 days in the rear. So, my guess is that trend will continue to decline as we see data from March and April.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and hi, everyone. Bhav may be on polyethylene. You know there's a pretty FX spread now or arm spread between the U.S. and in Asia. I think it's the highest level ever. And you know usually those get our doubt. What do you think is going to happen? Do you think the Asian price is going to need to move up a lot more than the U.S. price is going to need to move down or how do you envision this playing out over the coming quarters?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So, Vincent first of all I think we have to differentiate between the polypropylene price and polypropylene spreads. The polypropylene price could continue to come down on an absolute basis as propylene comes down - polypropylene. But the spreads are widening. We've announced another spread increase, markets are very tight. So, my sense is that global prices will likely come up and as propylene comes down some or has come down in the last month, you could see polypropylene absolute price moderate where I think spreads will continue to widen because the market is very tight.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is  for John. Congrats on another strong quarter. So, following on your comments, you made it around cash deployment. Cash flows are obviously very strong this year and they will likely continue so as the new products come on line. You noted that you plan to pay down some more debt this year. So, what's the target leverage for you and how should we think about further allocation of capital like how should we think about buybacks and do you think this is the right setup given the high margins to maybe expand your organic CapEx beyond the $2 billion mark? Thanks.\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So, let me start and then I'll ask Michael to add as well. Deleveraging continues to be our top priority. We want to get our debt to EBITDA metrics down below to an absolute debt in the $12 billion sort of range. And I think we're well-positioned to hit those kinds of numbers by year end. Based on what we see, a good trajectory of our earnings. Buybacks could certainly enter the picture after we reach these targets that we have, could be as soon as next year, early next year of that buybacks could be part of the picture. It\u2019s unlikely that will add to organic growth. We have our PO/TBA project that we're executing. We want to make sure we complete that. And beyond that, we don't have plans to start a new large organic project in the next 12 to 24 months.  Michael, anything else to add on capital allocation?\nMichael McMurray: Yes. I mean maybe just a couple of comments, Bhav. I mean just a reminder, you know, last year we generated very strong cash flow $3.4 billion from ops almost 90% conversion. We more than covered capital and our dividend. And that was I think pretty impressive. As Bhav said, we expect very strong cash flow generation this year. And we do expect to make meaningful progress in debt reduction. We've taken out a $1 billion of debt year-to-date. And I think kind of looking towards the end of the year, I think $3 billion to $4 billion in total debt reduction for the year is within reach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Sison from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nMichael Sison: Good morning. Nice start to the year. Bhav, in terms of your PE and TE effective operating rate right chart on Slide 9, there\u2019s a little dip there in 2022 and 2023. Is that considered mid-cycle in your outlook? And, if so, would you still be able to generate some EBITDA growth in LP in Americas and in 2022?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes. So, Mike, yes, I mean that's kind of mid cycle or better than mid cycle. That dip if you look at the operating rate, it's still above 90%. And generally when operating rates are greater than 90% typically the seasonal highs tend to be very tight. So, Q2, Q3 tend to be tight quarters in an annual average net above 90%. So, my sense is we're going to be somewhere mid-cycle or better in 2022 and 2023. And then after that as there's really not a whole lot of new capacity ex-China we should see the cycle play out.  I wanted to also answer Vincent\u2019s question about polyethylene. Vincent, I thought you asked about polypropylene building on the prior question. On polyethylene spreads, you know the market is still extremely tight. So, our sense is that the price increases that have been implemented could remain in place through Q3. There are more increases out there. Market remains tight. And again, as I've said several times we really don't know where the real level of demand is because we've been on allocation and we know our customers want more if we had it. So, if we had the product. So, I think that these spreads should stay well into Q3 for polyethylene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duffy Fischer from Barclays. Your line is open. \nDuffy Fischer: Good morning. Bhav, you just kind of made a comment working off your slide 9 that the dip you see coming kind of takes us to mid-cycle and then obviously better than that going forward. So, kind of the next five to seven years all look like they're better than mid-cycle. So, can you walk us through what that would mean for reinvestment economics for a new cracker in the U.S.? And then maybe touch on globally, obviously, with your catalyst business, you get a first look at what everybody's thinking about doing globally. How many new announcements for new crackers should we expect this year?\nMichael McMurray: Sure, Duffy. So first of all on a mid-cycle returns, yes, I think if you - first of all, if you look at that chart, it's actually probably better than mid-cycle other than maybe 2022. And again, if demand grows at 7% then I think you have a chance of actually having just a flat line and not much of a dip at all and we're headed in that direction it seems to me. So based on that and where CapEx has turned out recently on new projects. I still think it kind of leaves us that maybe low-double-digit kind of returns. And more importantly many companies who would think about investing are likely thinking about repairing their balance sheets from last year and paying down debt. So, I don't expect with this sort of a profile for there to be a rush in terms of new project announcements let\u2019s say ex-China, but let's see how it develops, each company has its own considerations. But certainly for us, we don't have plans to take on additional organic growth in O&P in the near-term. In terms of your question about what are we seeing from catalyst activity and licensing activity, we are seeing slower activity in China compared to what we saw over the last two years especially in polyethylene. So and we participate in most if not all tenders - that occur for a new project. So, it seems the activity is slowing compared to 2018 and 2019.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Roberts from UBS. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn Roberts: Yes hi, Bhav. Just to be in Slide 9 to debt here on the polyethylene outlook. Aren\u2019t the Chinese now building plants in three years so that anything beyond 2023 may not be in the consultant\u2019s forecast now for supply?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes so, John first of all, I think Slide 9 is really important when you think - so we can't beat it to death enough I suppose. So, I would say that we're already into 2021, right. So, the forecasts out through 2025 are probably pretty firm in terms of what could be built and what sort of supply we should expect from China. Post 2025, it remains to be seen. But I would say 3.5 years something like that is the build time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nBob Koort: Thank you very much. I guess we'll keep beating away and Bhav on - you mentioned that time duration. I thought maybe in the Bora project you guys worked on the construction to commercial ops is a little bit faster. So, was there something unique to that project? Or what insights did you get from working with those guys there about what it might suggest across the industry in China as you can appreciate for a lot of investors the lack of transparency there makes it sort of difficult to handicap what's actually going to happen?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes so, Bob on Bora remember, first of all, it was in the north which is a less congested area in terms of new projects up in Liaoning province. So - and we joined the project while it was already in construction and we restarted our discussions. And, of course, we signed the definitive agreements within a month or two of start-up. I still think Bob three to three and a half year is probably the right time to think about a project being approved to the time we have in production.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Bhav just on oxyfuels refining, can you discuss the improvement you're looking at for Q2 and even in the back half of the year? And refining do you think we'll have positive EBITDA next year in this business?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, so on oxyfuels we've already seen improvement as gasoline prices have come up and we've seen the blend premium come back a bit. So, it's recovered more than our base refining business has. We're getting closer to breakeven. David, my hope is that in Q3 we get to breakeven, in Q4 we're positive in the refining business. Now, that depends on the pace of reopening. I can tell you here in Houston the traffic is back in the evening when I drive home. It\u2019s I-10 coming out of Houston is full going both ways. So, I think more and more we're going to see the summer driving season could be very strong with a lot of pent-up demand for vacations and people wanting to get away. So, I think the refining business should see breakeven soon and positive profitability certainly by Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Your line is open.\nMatthew Blair: Great thanks. Good morning, Bhav. You know so many things going right here. Let me ask about the one area that's lagging of course and that's refining due these historic RIN obligations. Is there anything you can do to mitigate your exposure maybe by buying extra RINs forward or potentially looking at like a renewable diesel project?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, Matthew, you're right. The RINs have been quite a burden for us this year in our refining business. We're probably spending something like 3x more than we did last year on RINs. In the near term, I don't see anything else we can do. At some point the government will reset the mandate on RINs and then we could see the price moderate. But in the near term, we're doing all we can in terms of these renewable diesel sort of projects but that would be much more longer term and at the moment, we're not pursuing those sorts of projects in our refining business. So, we're just trying to run hard, run at maximum rates, and anticipate the recovery and miles driven.\nOperator: And our last question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research. Sir, your line is open.\nFrank Mitsch: Mr. Kinney. Good job saving the best for last. Very, very much appreciate it. Bhav, I was very struck by the comment that the market is going to be tight through the end of the year. Because I think just like two months ago the thought process was it would be tight through the end of the third quarter. So apparently, you've gained a little bit more visibility and feel that it's going to be tight through the end of the year? So that's obviously - that's pretty positive. And you're going to be operating full out in the second quarter which begs the question. Where were you guys in the first quarter on your O&P businesses in terms of operating rates? And as we look at the second quarter, where do you think the industry is going to be operating at in the O&P segments?\nBhavesh Patel: Yes, So Frank on the operating rates I mean in Q1, we lost about 30 days of production on average in our Texas asset. One of our crackers was down for almost 90 days. So now, we\u2019re back-up and running fully. I suspect that - our competitors do have some planned downtime, maintenance that they had planned last year that was diverted into this year. So likely, our operating rate - on a plan basis is higher than most in Q2. Your earlier question about our confidence about the outlook I think, Frank, as time goes on. I just see the number of shortages on consumable items, on automobiles, lumber, steel. There's sort of like furniture, if you want to buy furniture, there's like a six-month delay from the time you ordered to the time you receive. And then reopening is still in front of us. I think there are so many factors that provide a very strong setup for how demand will develop for really all of our products in the company. So, that makes me more optimistic. About the fact that we'll have tighter markets for longer as we go through the year. So, thanks for your questions.\nBhavesh Patel: I do have a few closing remarks if I may. First of all, really good questions as always in Slide 9 we\u2019ll continue to be part of our discussion as we go forward. I want to emphasize a couple of things. First of all, Q2 we're going to run full rates, no planned downtime. As I mentioned, there's a lot of backlog. We have reopening still in front of us. That should benefit our refining and oxyfuels business and continue to underpin demand strength in the other businesses that have been doing well. I think it's very important to note that with the larger asset base that we have, we've added $1 billion to $1.2 billion more of EBITDA as we sit here today at mid-cycle kind of margins. Now, clearly today we\u2019re well above mid-cycle margins in some of our businesses. So, I think that\u2019s a bit differential for LyondellBasell that in 2021 more assets deployed in a much, much stronger market. And I\u2019m really pleased that we can see a path to perhaps reaching our leverage targets by year-end both on a gross debt basis and on the debt to EBITDA metrics. So, that as I mentioned earlier brings buybacks kind of back into the equation as we think about capital allocation as we go into 2022. So, we look forward to giving you an update in July on our Q2 results. In the meantime, have a great and safe weekend. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for participating in today's conference.

            "name": "Bhavesh Patel",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave and good day to all of you participating around the world. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. Before we get into the discussion of our results, I would like to take a moment to recognize the tremendous progress that has been made in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and how much hard work still needs to be done around the world to reduce the effects of this disease. While financial markets are focused on the economic upside being enabled by increased vaccination and the eventual reopening, today our employees, customers, suppliers and the communities where we operate in India in particular as well as Brazil and even parts of Europe are still suffering from terribly high case rates and fatalities. We are working closely with governments around the world to do our part to advance immunity for our employees and their communities and to hasten and end to the devastation brought on by this virus. Our thoughts remain with those most affected by this pandemic. Thank you, Michael. Let me summarize our view of current conditions and the outlook for our businesses with Slide 19. We began this year with low inventories and increasing demand from a recovering global economy. During our fourth quarter earnings call in January, we thought that strong February order books, increasing seasonal demand, and tight industry supply would support strong margins for at least the first half of 2021. Since January, our industry lost several weeks of supply due to Texas weather events during February and deferred maintenance from 2020 is resulting in high levels of planned downtime across the industry, particularly in the second quarter. North American inventories were depleted during the downtime and European inventories have been pressured by unusually strong first quarter demand. While our company normally maintains over one month of polyolefins sales inventory, our European PE and PP businesses ended March at levels well below those targets, most notably with less than two weeks of low density polyethylene inventory.  Logistics constraints are exacerbating the situation due to shortages of shipping containers on critical routes and escalating freight rates that are limiting opportunities for regional arbitrage. China remains structurally short of polyethylene. And U.S. exports to China have vanished as North American suppliers seek to replenish inventories and address order backlogs from domestic customers. Backlogs for finished goods are rising as the recovering global economy continues to be supported by government stimulus and pent-up demand emerges with increased vaccination rates. In summary, we believe that tight global markets are likely to persist well into the second half of this year and continued improvements in mobility and associated economic activity could sustain strong volumes and margins into 2022. Please turn to Slide 20 and let's review LyondellBasell's profitability over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. In the years following the 2008 Great Recession, our company nimbly captured the benefits of low cost feedstocks that arose from the development of North American oil and gas resources. LyondellBasell typically delivered between $6 billion to $7 billion of EBITDA over the past 10 years. Our EBITDA after LCM inventory adjustments reached $8.1 billion in 2015 during my first year as CEO of our company. At the end of 2019, we thought we might simply be coming to the end of a very long business cycle, until we learn more about COVID and the extreme tolls it would take on our society, the economy and ultimately in human lives.  As we rebound from the pandemic and contemplate how our company could perform through the recovery in the next business cycle it is worthwhile to consider the factors that should provide additional earnings power relative to our performance last year and in the previous cycle. Recovery in automotive and other durable goods demand is rebuilding volumes within our new APS segment back towards 2018 levels. Increased utilization of our capacity should provide greater visibility on the more than $200 million in synergies that we've built into the business since acquiring A. Schulman. In 2020 we added 500,000 tons of polyethylene capacity utilizing our next generation hyper zone technology. During the depths of the pandemic and recession our strong balance sheet enabled us to move forward and form accretive joint ventures for integrated crackers in China and Louisiana that provided immediate returns on our investments. This quarter we finalized an agreement to form our second propylene oxide joint venture with Sinopec.  Beyond the broad-based margin improvements that are currently underway for many of our products, full recovery and demand for transportation fuels still lies ahead and should drive margin improvement for our sizable refining and oxyfuels businesses over the coming quarters.  Our larger asset base is well-poised to capture the opportunities of a recovering economy, establish new earnings benchmarks, and position LyondellBasell for further growth over the upcoming business cycle.  Coming close with Slide 21. The title of our 2020 annual report is Emerging Stronger and it is an appropriate description of LyondellBasell's trajectory as the global economy recovers from the pandemic and recession. Our leading and advantaged business positions are primed to capture the benefits of a recovering economy. In the second quarter, we have no measure planned downtime and we are operating our highly reliable and low-cost global network of assets at maximum rates to capture rising margins. We've remained steadfast to our disciplined financial strategy. Over the coming year, our priority will continue to be deleveraging while supporting shareholder returns with a strong and progressive dividend. We remain committed to an investment grade credit rating and our plan is to bolster our credit metrics through increased earnings and additional debt reduction over the coming quarters. Our aim is to maximize free cash flow by leveraging our larger asset base efficiently converting earnings into cash and deploying capital in a prudent manner towards high-return investments. All of this will help drive our ultimate focus on delivering strong shareholder returns. The outlook for our business is quite promising. And we look forward to delivering our commitments over the coming quarters. We're now pleased to take your questions. Well, thank you. Sure, P.J. So, first of all in terms of capacity delays, I think in China we should assume that capacity will come on part of schedule for those projects that are already underway. I think for projects that haven't started in China, certainly the CTO and MTO projects are probably at risk. And we've learned recently that government is considering canceling those projects for the environment. In the U.S. because of COVID, the projects that are underway maybe were delayed a quarter or two especially Q2, Q3 last year. As there were slowdowns until we all figured out how to manage density in our sites and construction sites. So, maybe a couple of quarters for those projects that are underway. And if you think longer term, projects that CTO/MTO based in China could be at risk. Mike? Yes thank you, Arun. First of all in inventory, I was actually just looking at that data this morning. The industry data and industry inventories both PE and PP are below typical levels that we've seen in the past. Again, I think following on from what I answered to Steve earlier, we still don't know what's the level of demand. My guess is the level of demand is higher than what we saw in February and March. And so, our first priority is to meet the demand of our customers and then find the opportunity to rebuild inventory. So, if you think about what's ahead, we still have reopening ahead in the U.S. We are reopening ahead in Europe, many parts of Asia, ex-China still reopening ahead so, stronger demand period. Typically, we see seasonal improvement so opportunity to rebuild inventory, we may not have that until later in Q3. Also recall that there's a lot of planned downtime in the industry because many producers deferred planned maintenance last year into this year. So, I think all of these reasons are why the setup looks to be for a very tight market for most of this year if not all. So, Kevin on polypropylene you know more of it goes into durable goods than does polyethylene. And I'm sure all of our listeners have heard about the shortage of chips that have limited automobile production. I think that's going to cause more demand as some of those constraints relieve themselves and there's more chips available. And generally speaking auto sales are up. Inventories are low. Fleet sales have been low. Rental car fleets have been depleted last year. So, all of that has to be replenished. So, my sense is that polypropylene market will continue to be strong. And if I were to look at inventories the data that I saw this morning from an industry perspective in the U.S. PP inventories are actually lower than PE inventories. And this data that I'm citing is 60 days in the rear. So, my guess is that trend will continue to decline as we see data from March and April. Yes. So, Vincent first of all I think we have to differentiate between the polypropylene price and polypropylene spreads. The polypropylene price could continue to come down on an absolute basis as propylene comes down - polypropylene. But the spreads are widening. We've announced another spread increase, markets are very tight. So, my sense is that global prices will likely come up and as propylene comes down some or has come down in the last month, you could see polypropylene absolute price moderate where I think spreads will continue to widen because the market is very tight. Yes. So, let me start and then I'll ask Michael to add as well. Deleveraging continues to be our top priority. We want to get our debt to EBITDA metrics down below to an absolute debt in the $12 billion sort of range. And I think we're well-positioned to hit those kinds of numbers by year end. Based on what we see, a good trajectory of our earnings. Buybacks could certainly enter the picture after we reach these targets that we have, could be as soon as next year, early next year of that buybacks could be part of the picture. It's unlikely that will add to organic growth. We have our PO/TBA project that we're executing. We want to make sure we complete that. And beyond that, we don't have plans to start a new large organic project in the next 12 to 24 months.  Michael, anything else to add on capital allocation? Yes. So, Mike, yes, I mean that's kind of mid cycle or better than mid cycle. That dip if you look at the operating rate, it's still above 90%. And generally when operating rates are greater than 90% typically the seasonal highs tend to be very tight. So, Q2, Q3 tend to be tight quarters in an annual average net above 90%. So, my sense is we're going to be somewhere mid-cycle or better in 2022 and 2023. And then after that as there's really not a whole lot of new capacity ex-China we should see the cycle play out.  I wanted to also answer Vincent's question about polyethylene. Vincent, I thought you asked about polypropylene building on the prior question. On polyethylene spreads, you know the market is still extremely tight. So, our sense is that the price increases that have been implemented could remain in place through Q3. There are more increases out there. Market remains tight. And again, as I've said several times we really don't know where the real level of demand is because we've been on allocation and we know our customers want more if we had it. So, if we had the product. So, I think that these spreads should stay well into Q3 for polyethylene. Yes so, John first of all, I think Slide 9 is really important when you think - so we can't beat it to death enough I suppose. So, I would say that we're already into 2021, right. So, the forecasts out through 2025 are probably pretty firm in terms of what could be built and what sort of supply we should expect from China. Post 2025, it remains to be seen. But I would say 3.5 years something like that is the build time. Yes so, Bob on Bora remember, first of all, it was in the north which is a less congested area in terms of new projects up in Liaoning province. So - and we joined the project while it was already in construction and we restarted our discussions. And, of course, we signed the definitive agreements within a month or two of start-up. I still think Bob three to three and a half year is probably the right time to think about a project being approved to the time we have in production. Yes, so on oxyfuels we've already seen improvement as gasoline prices have come up and we've seen the blend premium come back a bit. So, it's recovered more than our base refining business has. We're getting closer to breakeven. David, my hope is that in Q3 we get to breakeven, in Q4 we're positive in the refining business. Now, that depends on the pace of reopening. I can tell you here in Houston the traffic is back in the evening when I drive home. It's I-10 coming out of Houston is full going both ways. So, I think more and more we're going to see the summer driving season could be very strong with a lot of pent-up demand for vacations and people wanting to get away. So, I think the refining business should see breakeven soon and positive profitability certainly by Q4. Yes, Matthew, you're right. The RINs have been quite a burden for us this year in our refining business. We're probably spending something like 3x more than we did last year on RINs. In the near term, I don't see anything else we can do. At some point the government will reset the mandate on RINs and then we could see the price moderate. But in the near term, we're doing all we can in terms of these renewable diesel sort of projects but that would be much more longer term and at the moment, we're not pursuing those sorts of projects in our refining business.

Yes, So Frank on the operating rates I mean in Q1, we lost about 30 days of production on average in our Texas asset. One of our crackers was down for almost 90 days.

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Bhav and good morning everyone. Please turn to Slide 10 and let me begin by highlighting our track record of strong cash conversion. Over the last 12 months, LyondellBasell converted almost 80% of her EBITDA into $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. In the first quarter of 2021, our business has delivered over 40% more free operating cash flow relative to the same period last year. We expect continued improvement of our LCM performance as we progressed through each quarter of 2021. Let's turn to Slide 11 and review further details of our cash generation and deployment during the first quarter. As Bhav mentioned, our goal for this year is to accomplish meaningful deleveraging to further strengthen our investment grade balance sheet. In the first quarter, while paying dividends of $352 million and investing a similar amount in capital expenditures, we reduced the balance on our term loan by $500 million to close the first quarter with cash and liquid investments of $1.8 billion. After the quarter closed, we repaid an additional $500 million on the term loan in April. We expect that robust cash generation should enable continued progress on deleveraging throughout the year. Before I continue with a more detailed discussion of our segment results, let me provide a brief update on our 2021 modeling guidance. We continue to be on track to invest approximately $2 billion in capital expenditures during 2021. Target equally towards profit generating growth projects and sustaining maintenance. Due to extremely strong demand for propylene oxide, we have shifted a turnaround at one of our PO/TBA units in Bayport, Texas from the second quarter to the third quarter of this year and reduced the scope and associated downtime for the maintenance. With this change, we expect no major planned maintenance downtime in the second quarter of 2021 and based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that the third quarter EBITDA impact due to lost production associated with planned maintenance across the company will increase by $30 million to $75 million. In total, the impact associated with all of LyondellBasell's 2021 planned maintenance downtime should decreased by $30 million relative to our original guidance to approximately $140 million for the year. Let's turn to Slide 12 and review our quarterly profitability. In the first quarter of 2021 LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered EBITDA of $1.6 billion. This was an improvement of more than $300 million relative to the fourth quarter, exceeding typical first quarter seasonal trends. The upward trajectory of LyondellBasell's profitability reflects improving demand and margins for products driven by the recovery global economy and tight markets. As Bob mentioned, cold weather and associated power outages resulted in unplanned shutdowns that constrained first quarter production for LyondellBasell and nearly all of our competitors in the state of Texas. This downturn was exacerbated by strong global demand that tightened markets and elevated margins across most of our businesses. While it's clear that we lost production during the first quarter due to unplanned downtime, the offsetting effects of higher margins and sales from inventory complicates the effort to quantify the impact on first quarter business results. In the second quarter, we plan to operate our assets at nearly full rates as profitability improves for Oxyfuels and Refining businesses. We expect further EBITDA improvement during the second quarter. On the left side of the chart, our all-time high quarterly EBITDA excluding LCM of approximately $2.2 billion reported in the third quarter of 2015 provides useful perspective. While profitability for transportation fuels was quite strong in 2015, today our company has more earnings power from a larger asset base. Over the last six years, we have added ethylene capacity at Corpus Christi, expanded our compounding business to the acquisition of A. Schulman, started a new Hyperzone HDPE plant in Houston and added significant joint venture capacity in Louisiana and China. In 2021, LyondellBasell is poised to capture opportunities that are emerging in the rebounding global economy with a larger asset base. Now, let's review the first quarter results for each of our segments. As mentioned, my discussion will describe our underlying business results excluding the non-cash impacts of LCM inventory changes. I will begin with our Olefins & Polyolefins Americas segment on Slide 13. Third quarter EBITDA was $867 million, $145 million higher than the fourth quarter. Tight markets and strong demand resulted in improved margins driving quarter results higher than we've seen since 2015. Olefin results increased approximately $155 million compared to the fourth quarter. Olefin's margins increased with higher ethylene and propylene prices outpacing higher feedstock and utility costs. Volumes decreased due to downtime driven by Texas weather events partially offset by a full quarter of volume from our Louisiana joint venture that we formed in December. The ethylene cracker at the joint venture ran continuously throughout the weather events and exceeded ethylene nameplate operating rates by 9% during March. Polyolefin results for the segment decreased by about $15 million during the first quarter. Polyethylene margin decreased while polypropylene margin improved. Polyethylene volume increased due to a full quarter of contribution from the Louisiana joint venture, partially offset by lost production during the weather events. We anticipate both volume and margin improvement for our O&P Americas segment during the second quarter. Volumes are expected to rebound in the absence of weather-related downtime. Tight markets due to high demand, low inventories and customer backlogs are expected to continue to support strong integrated chain margins. Now, please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and international segment. During the first quarter, EBITDA was $412 million, $161 million higher than the fourth quarter. Strong demand, expanded margins driving quarterly results higher than we have seen for the segment since 2018. Olefins results increased $30 million driven by increased margins and volumes. Ethylene margin improved due to increased ethylene prices and lower fixed costs despite higher feedstock costs. Demand was robust during the quarter and we increased volumes by operating our crackers at a rate of 98% almost 10% above industry benchmarks for the first quarter.  Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $150 million compared to the prior quarter. Strong polymer demand drove spread improvements for both polyethylene and polypropylene prices relative to monomer. Margin improvements at our Middle East and Asia joint ventures were offset by higher LPG feedstock costs, pressuring profitability at our new joint venture in China resulted in little change in equity income for the segment. During the second quarter, we expect strong demand and tight markets to drive further margin improvement for O&P-EAI businesses. Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. First quarter EBITDA was $182 million, $14 million lower than the prior quarter. Margins improved with higher product prices while volumes declined due to the Texas weather events and planned maintenance in our propylene oxide and derivatives business. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results decreased by approximately $35 million due to lower volumes offsetting stronger margins driven by tight market supply. Intermediate chemical results decreased about $55 million due to lower volumes as a result of the weather events. Oxyfuels and related products results increased by approximately $25 million as a result of higher margins benefiting from improved gasoline prices that were partially offset by constrained volumes. We expect both volumes and margins to improve for our I&D segment in the second quarter. Strong demand for durable goods coupled with continued tight market supply are expected to increase profitability across most of the businesses in the segment. Now, let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. First quarter EBITDA was $135 million, $9 million higher than the fourth quarter. Volumes improved driven by higher demand for our products partially offset by lower margins. Compounding and solution results were relatively unchanged with higher volumes driven by improved demand being offset by compressed margins due to rising feedstock costs. Advanced polymer results increased by approximately $50 million due to both higher margins and volumes. In April, North American feedstock costs for our polypropylene compounds rapidly declined to reverse much of the price escalation that occurred during the first quarter. We expect that falling feedstock prices combined with continued price improvements were compounded products will expand margins during the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was negative $110 dollars. A $36 million decrease versus the fourth quarter of 2020. Higher cost for renewable fuel credits or rens and lower crude throughput overwhelmed improvements in the Maya 2-1-1 industry crack spread. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 crack spread increased by $5.21 per barrel to $15.32 per barrel. As a result of the Texas weather event, the average crude throughput at the refinery fell to 152,000 barrels per day. In April, we continue to see improvements in refined product demand and we are running the refinery at nearly full rates. Strong demand for diesel and improving demand for gasoline is expected to improve both volumes and margins at our refinery during the second half of this year. However, we don't expect a full recovery until there is further progress in vaccination rates and a rebound in global demand for jet fuel, driven by increased business and international air travel.  Please turn to Slide 18, as we review the results of our Technology segment. First quarter Technology segment EBITDA was $94 million, $49 million higher than the prior quarter. Catalyst profitability increased with customers rebuilding inventories and increased demand from Asia and the Middle East. Based on anticipated timing of upcoming licensing milestones and catalyst demand, we expect that second quarter technology business profitability will be similar to the first quarter.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Bhav. So, good morning Jeff and for everyone, thanks for your patience with our longer prepared remarks, there's a lot going on. So, we wanted to provide color. So Jeff in terms of peak EBITDA, if you think about the kind of mid-cycle margins up to now we've added between $1 billion and $1.2 billion of EBITDA. In 2023, we'll add another $500 million with our Sinopec PO-SM project and the PO-TBA project. So, I would say at mid-cycle margins we've added $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion of EBITDA. And if you - were to consider peak earnings then it would be something even more than that. Oh in Bora, question about Bora phase 2. So we're still discussing with our partner on Bora phase 2. No definitive decisions yet. I would say that would be middle of the decade or beyond in terms of product hitting the market. Yes, so good morning Steve. On the Sasol marketing, so pre-pandemic our view was that we would plug that volume into our global network and sell in Europe and in China and also supplement in the U.S. So, that's still our plan. But in the near term, because of the supply disruptions really spot sales have been zero. We've been on allocation. So, exports are only those where we have contracts. We're not doing spot exports. We don't have enough volume today. And our inventories are below our typical levels. So, our focus in the near-term will be to meet domestic demand, which is - which we still don't know what level that demand is, because of the supply constraints. And then, we'll look to resume exports. Yes. I mean maybe just a couple of comments, Bhav. I mean just a reminder, you know, last year we generated very strong cash flow $3.4 billion from ops almost 90% conversion. We more than covered capital and our dividend. And that was I think pretty impressive. As Bhav said, we expect very strong cash flow generation this year. And we do expect to make meaningful progress in debt reduction. We've taken out a $1 billion of debt year-to-date. And I think kind of looking towards the end of the year, I think $3 billion to $4 billion in total debt reduction for the year is within reach. Sure, Duffy. So first of all on a mid-cycle returns, yes, I think if you - first of all, if you look at that chart, it's actually probably better than mid-cycle other than maybe 2022. And again, if demand grows at 7% then I think you have a chance of actually having just a flat line and not much of a dip at all and we're headed in that direction it seems to me. So based on that and where CapEx has turned out recently on new projects. I still think it kind of leaves us that maybe low-double-digit kind of returns. And more importantly many companies who would think about investing are likely thinking about repairing their balance sheets from last year and paying down debt. So, I don't expect with this sort of a profile for there to be a rush in terms of new project announcements let's say ex-China, but let's see how it develops, each company has its own considerations. But certainly for us, we don't have plans to take on additional organic growth in O&P in the near-term. In terms of your question about what are we seeing from catalyst activity and licensing activity, we are seeing slower activity in China compared to what we saw over the last two years especially in polyethylene. So and we participate in most if not all tenders - that occur for a new project. So, it seems the activity is slowing compared to 2018 and 2019."

Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Kim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on the fourth quarter and full year 2022 results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.  With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2022 results. Let's begin with our safety results on Slide number 3. LyondellBasell's employees and contractors delivered an outstanding safety performance during 2022. Injury rates at our company have consistently been among the lowest for our industry. But last year, we reduced the rate of injuries across our global workforce by roughly [0.5] to 0.12 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. At our Bayport complex outside of Houston, our team finished 2022 with over 6 million consecutive safe work hours, a new company record. Simply put, a consistent focus on safe work is embedded in our company's DNA and provides a solid foundation for extending that shared focus across other dimensions of the company's culture. Let's now turn to Slide number 4 to discuss our financial results. 2022 was a very challenging year characterized by a war in Ukraine, evolving responses to the COVID pandemic, energy volatility, inflation and rapidly changing monetary policies. At LyondellBasell, our portfolio of businesses continued to provide value for our global customers with products and solutions that are essential for modern society. In '22, LyondellBasell delivered earnings of $12.46 per share with EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Cash generation was exceptional and resulted in $6.1 billion of cash from operations; second only to our 2021 results. We ended the year with $6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment rate balance sheet. Interim invested capital was 16%, far exceeding our cost of capital. In addition to our focus on safety, we are sharpening our strategic focus to maximize value for our customers, shareholders and society under a range of scenarios. On Slide number 5, we outlined our progress on delivering value from this strategy over the past year. Our leadership in cost management and operational excellence enabled LyondellBasell to hold fixed costs well below inflation, and quickly adjust operating rates in response to evolving market conditions. Our diverse global business portfolio provided outstanding cash generation during a challenging year. And at the same time, we positioned the portfolio for changing times with decisions to exit refining and sell our Australian polypropylene business. We established a new business unit, focused on establishing leadership in providing circular and low-carbon solutions for our customers. And we are advancing our supply chains, production capacity and sustainable assets to serve rapidly growing markets for these circular and low-carbon products. Last quarter, we announced our increased focus on capturing value as we continue to manage costs. We expect our value enhancement program will generate at least $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Our increased focus helped drive a [13 percent point] improvement in cash conversion in 2022. That further bolstered our capital structure and supported generous shareholder returns. On Slide number 6, I would like to highlight our recent decisions to accelerate progress on our climate targets and create more value by doing so. In order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, climate scientists believe that global warming should be limited to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In December, we announced our decision to increase LyondellBasell's 2030 targets for reducing scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to 42% and established a new Scope 3 emission reduction target of 30% relative to 2020 levels. Targets are now aligned with the science-based guidance and the 1.5 degree Celsius scenario. In addition, as we continue to make progress in sourcing, favorably priced renewable electricity, we have increased our 2030 goal to procure at least 75% of our global power generation needs from renewable and low-carbon sources. Earlier this week, we announced our first 2 renewable power purchase agreements in Europe and 2 additional agreements in the United States. Altogether, we now have 8 agreements in place for 930 megawatts of renewable power capacity, which represents roughly 1/3 of our global needs. These agreements will prevent nearly 1 million tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions. All of this work supports our goal to become net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050. At the same time, we continued to build global businesses that will sell at least 2 million tons of recycled and renewable base polymers by 2030. On Slide number 7, let's take a look at how we are building our Circle brands of recycled and renewable base polymers. During the fourth quarter, we announced progress in developing 4 new plastic waste sorting and recycling facilities in Houston, Germany, India and China. These facilities provide a strong foundation for a robust global supply chain for plastic grade feedstocks. And with our 3 product platforms, CirculenRecover for mechanical recycling, CirculenRevive for advanced recycling, and CirculenRenew for renewable-based feedstocks, LyondellBasell will be able to match feedstocks and products with the highest value solutions for our customers. The combination of our focus, detail, technologies and global platforms provides LyondellBasell with powerful advantages to build the world's leading circular and low-carbon Solutions business.  Now with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by highlighting our excellent cash generation from our business portfolio during 2022. LyondellBasell generated a total of $6.1 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Our cash on hand increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2022, we achieved cash conversion of 96%, 13 percentage points higher than our 2021 cash conversion. In the fourth quarter, cash conversion reached an outstanding rate of 203%. This efficient and robust cash generation allowed the company to return a total of $3.7 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2022. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. Our approach remains focused on disciplined capital allocation and strong returns for our shareholders. During 2022, cash from operating activities fully funded dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. We returned approximately 60% of the cash from operating activities to shareholders. This included $3.2 billion in quarterly and special dividends and $420 million in share repurchases. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%. This represents our 12th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $1.9 billion in capital expenditures. A significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction of our world-scale PO/TBA plant. Startup activities remain on track for the end of this quarter. Our transformation of is working across our company to rigorously manage and track the progress of our value enhancement program. We look forward to sharing the progress of this program at our Capital Markets Day in March. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $865 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected margins stabilizing at the low levels seen towards the end of the third quarter. Moderating energy and feedstock costs provided modest offsets for compressed margins in our olefins and polyolefins businesses. Overall, OMP demand remained low, particularly in Europe and China. Intermediates and Derivatives results sequentially declined on lower volumes due to the quarterly timing of oxyfuel vessel shipments. Margins at our oxyfuels and refining businesses remained above historical averages as demand for fuels remained strong due to increasing global mobility. High cost for utilities and raw materials coupled with low seasonal demand negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge impacts pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $90 million. Fourth quarter LIFO charges were approximately $15 million for O&P Americas segment, $50 million for the O&P [EII] segment each for the intermediates and derivatives in APS segments, $15 million for the Technology segment and a $40 million benefit for the refining segment. As a reminder, volatility in natural gas prices impacts our cost for not only gas, but also steam and electricity. We estimate that a $1 per million BTU change in the price of natural gas impacts the energy cost of our directly operated assets by approximately $175 million per year across the company with 80% of this impact in North America and 20% in Europe. These estimates do not include the impact of gas price on feedstock cost. Before I turn the call over to Ken and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our segment results in more detail, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2023 on Slide 11. As our new world-scale PO/TBA plant ramps up, we expect to produce and sell about half of the asset's nameplate capacity in 2023. We remain confident that our value enhancement program can achieve recurring annual EBITDA of $150 million by the end of 2023 through the execution of about 1,000 projects. In order to achieve this benefit, we expect to incur a similar amount of onetime capital and operational cost of about $150 million, with the majority of these costs allocated to capital. Major planned maintenance for 2023 included a turnaround at one of our Midwest ethylene crackers in the O&P Americas segment, turnarounds at our acetyls assets and 3 propylene oxide plant turnarounds within our I&D segment. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2023 EBITDA and by approximately $290 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. During the fourth quarter, we recognized costs related to the exit from our refining business, which impacted EBITDA by $73 million. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect the business will incur similar EBITDA impacts during each quarter of 2023. We will also recognize about $55 million each quarter for depreciation charges to reflect cost accrued for asset decommissioning that will be incurred after the asset shuts down. We expect that our capital expenditures will decline by about $300 million to approximately $1.6 billion this year with the completion of the PO/TBA plant and disciplined spend resulting from the current business environment. Approximately $500 million of CapEx is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects with the remaining balance supporting sustaining maintenance. We expect that this year's capital requirements for the value enhancement program will be funded within our $1.6 billion CapEx budget. Other financial metrics worth noting include net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, pension related estimates and tax rates. We expect 2023 net interest expense will be approximately $405 million. Depreciation and amortization charges for 2023 are expected to be $1.4 billion, which includes the [$202 million] of additional refinery depreciation charges related to asset decommissioning. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2023, totaling about $65 million with approximately $105 million of pension expense for the year. We expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\nKenneth Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter O&P Americas EBITDA was $359 million. Prices and margins stabilized at the low levels we saw at the end of the third quarter. Market demand declined, and we also saw customer destocking during the quarter. That, combined with new polymer capacity resulted in well-supplied markets. We operated our assets at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity to match the reduced market demand and manage working capital. During January, we have seen modest improvements in domestic and export demand. Normalization of logistics constraints have facilitated increased export volumes. Also, moderating feedstock and energy costs are providing some margin tailwinds. As a result, we expect to operate our O&P Americas asset at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter. Looking back at 2022, I want to highlight our progress on developing our Circulen business. We have established projects for classic waste sorting facilities that will be used to provide feedstock for our circular recover and certain the Revive product lines. We are also moving phoned our usage of olefins feedstocks produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil. During 2022, we processed 15,000 tons of renewable feedstocks at our Channelview, Texas cracker, to produce ethylene, propylene and ultimately, polyethylene and polypropylene that we sold to customers at premium prices under our Circular brand. Last year, 4 of our U.S. manufacturing sites attained the ISCC Plus certification for certain grades of polyethylene and polypropylene. This enables LyondellBasell to offer customers mass balance certificates for these products and serve the market's rapidly growing demand. We are delivering these new circular new products to our customers and proving that polymers can be more sustainable and used in any application where virgin polymer is used. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. In Europe, macroeconomic pressures were exacerbated by high inflation and energy costs that curtailed operations at our customers and pressured consumer demand. LyondellBasell operated our O&P assets at rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter. LIFO inventory charges were $50 million during the quarter. All of this combined to result in a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $152 million. European energy costs have considerably moderated in January, and demand is showing some signs of improvement over the extremely low level seen in December. We have completed repairs and we started our integrated cracker in France at the end of 2022 and expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 80% during the first quarter. As in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies to support our Circulen and Low Carbon Solutions business in Europe and Asia. During October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China, and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India. These partnerships will allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose plants in each region to supply feedstocks for our circular products has served a rapidly growing market for circular solutions. In November, we announced our decision to move forward with engineering to build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. This plant will utilize LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology to convert plastic waste from our waste sorting facility into pyrolysis oil that can be used as a feedstock to produce new plastic resins in a circular process. We are moving rapidly to build circular and low-carbon solutions for our industry at an unmatched scale.  With that, I will turn the call over to Kim.\nKimberly Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $291 million. Styrene margins improved due to lower feedstock costs. Oxyfuel margins remained well above historical fourth quarter averages. Oxyfuel volumes declined as the timing of the vessel sailings resulted in unusually high third quarter volumes. We operated our assets at rates of approximately 75%. Our propylene oxide and styrene joint venture in the Netherlands is expected to restart this month after 3 months of downtime in response to volatile European energy costs and lower demand. We look forward to initial volumes from the new PO/TBA asset in Houston by the end of the quarter. We plan to operate our assets across the IND segment at approximately 80% in the first quarter. In January, we are encouraged by unseasonably strong oxyfuel margins with low butane feedstock costs and strong oxyfuel blend premiums. We expect relatively stable margins for the segment for the first quarter. We developed multiyear maintenance schedules to ensure that our plants can safely and reliably serve our customers. As it works out, 2023 will be a heavy year for maintenance across several of our PO/TBA assets. Maintenance is scheduled for 2 of our 3 PO/TBA plants at our Bayport, Texas facility in the second and fourth quarters. Our [indiscernible] PO/TBA facility in the Netherlands will also undergo maintenance from September through November. We expect the ramp-up in volumes of our new plant will be partially offset by loss production from this planned maintenance. Nonetheless, the incremental 2023 PO and TBA volumes should be sufficient to capture typical market growth. In 2024, we expect less scheduled maintenance and the full year of production from our new assets will provide additional volumes to serve market growth. Now let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $40 million. Results increased on higher margins and slightly higher volumes following the third of the planned maintenances, offset by the disruptions of the December freeze. In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread modestly increased to $48 per barrel, remaining well above historical averages. Despite unplanned downtime, we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 229,000 barrels per day. In January, the Maya 2-1-1 spreads have also been unseasonally strong at more than $50 per barrel, driven by strong discounts for heavy crudes. We expect to operate the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity in the first quarter. Finally, I would like to recognize our team at the refinery for finishing the year with 0 recordable injuries in 2022. This is the first time such a record has been achieved in the 104-year history of this facility. Our team is dedicated to safely and reliably operating these assets until we exit the business.  With that, I will turn it over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $3 million. Margins remain pressured by feedstock and energy costs as well as the $25 million noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge. Volumes fell on lower seasonal demand exacerbated by high power prices that impacted our European customers' businesses. In the fourth quarter, we embarked on a journey to transform the APS segment. Our goal is to sharpen our focus on customer service and product development to maximize value for our customers and for LyondellBasell. With increased autonomy and accountability, we are developing a more agile operating model with meaningful media and segment growth strategies. As part of this transformation, the Catalloy and polybutene businesses will be moved from APS and reintegrated into the O&P segment beginning January 1, 2023. This move will allow the APS team to sharpen their focus on the compounding business, distinct from the Polymer business of Cattaloy and polybutene, which serves our O&P value chain. From a portfolio point of view, we estimate APS will shift approximately $200 million of annual EBITDA between O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments very equally. We plan to provide additional information regarding the impact of this change in March. I strongly believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential and I look forward to reporting on our team's progress in delivering on this transformation during our Capital Markets Day in March.  With that, I will return the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. And to the entire LyondellBasell team, thank you again for all the hard work in delivering strong results during a challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, reduced global polyolefin industry operating rates resulted in lower catalyst volumes, licensing revenue moderated due to the timing of milestones for revenue recognition. We estimate that the first quarter results for the Technology segment will be similar to fourth quarter 2022 as catalyst volumes improve, offset by moderating licensing revenue. Our technology team is hard at work advancing engineering on LyondellBasell's first commercial advanced recycling plant. This plant will leverage on proprietary MoReTec technology to extract sale from most consumer mixed plastic waste by closing the loop and producing feedstocks for our Italian crackers. Our technology provides distinct advantages by reducing energy consumption, improving yields through innovative process designs and catalysis. Let me now summarize our results and first quarter outlook with Slide 18. Despite highly targets, our team is capturing value and moving forward on our strategic priorities. Most importantly, we are sharpening our focus on leveraging the scale of our clear portfolio to deliver resilient results. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. Last year's outstanding safety performance speaks to the depth with which safety is ingrained in our corporate culture. Our goal is to expand our core petro foundations to encompass a more comprehensive passion for value creation. This week, we welcomed Trisha Conley to our Executive Committee as Executive Vice President, People and Culture. Trisha will play a pivotal role in leading LyondellBasell's vision and strategy to enhance the employee experience, elevate our organizational performance and create the best and most inspiring culture in our industry. In 2022, our businesses were pressured by the effects of the war, volatile energy costs emergence from the pandemic and monetary policy. We responded by matching our reduction with changing demand, leveraging our global business portfolio and maximizing cash generation. Over the past year, our businesses generated over $6 billion of cash from operations and returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Lander focus and commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. The more annuity formed circular and carbon solutions business, we are laser-focused on meeting the needs of our customers, brand owners and society. Our decarbonization goals are now aligned with science-based guidance, and we have made substantial progress towards our 2030 goal to procure 75% of our electricity from renewable and low-carbon sources. The Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is well positioned to address the challenges of sustainability and plastic waste. By building an end-to-end business with robust supply chains, proprietary technology for transforming materials and our global manufacturing and marketing network, we're confident that we can build a large-scale and valuable leadership position in this exciting and expanding market. And our focus on sustainability is gaining recognition. In December, we were honored to be awarded the EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance with a 91st percentile ranking. The EcoVadis platform is valued by procurement professionals for assisting in the identification and evaluation of sustainable supply solutions. We expect modest improvements in the first quarter from moderating energy and feedstock costs, stable demand and the absence of fourth quarter life for charges. Normalizing supply chains or enabling improved trade flows from our advantaged feedstock positions in North America and the Middle East. Nonetheless, we will continue to maintain focus and discipline to ensure that operating rates across our global portfolio are matched to market conditions. As the year progresses, we anticipate seasonal demand improvements during the second and third quarter. And we're keeping a close eye on China's emergence from Covet and potential benefits from increased economic activity during the second half of 2023. The most exciting challenge during my first 8 months as the CEO of LyondellBasell has been the process of identifying and building a compelling strategy that generates substantial value for our customers, suppliers, employees, communities and shareholders over the next decade. We've shared some initial decisions with you already, but much more is ahead. As you will have recognized, we have waited until the Capital Markets Day, but started moving ahead with great focus and speed in the right direction. On Slide 19, we ask that you save the date for March 14, when we will share more details on our forward strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York, and we hope that you can all join us virtually or in person.  We are now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.\nP.J. Juvekar: Yes. Just had a quick question on China reopening. What do you see in terms of inventory in China at the ports? And then maybe you can make a comment on your China joint venture with Bora and where you -- what were the operating rates there?\nPeter Vanacker: Thanks, P.J. This is Peter. Let me take your question first and then potentially Ken can also add to that. When we talk about China, it's still early stage to say that we see a sustainable recovery. We expect -- I mean that, that will take probably another 3, 4 months until we see that recovery is actually happening. So we're still very modest in our expectations on China. But at least, I mean, we know that there has been the opening. So the government has changed their way. I mean, how to look at that -- at COVID. And Bora, still hanging in there, I would say. Not very positive because of the situation and because of capacity utilization rates locally in the market being at technical minimums. Ken?\nKenneth Lane : Yes, that's right. We continue to operate the joint venture of technical minimums. We've seen -- in two weeks, we're seeing a little bit of improvement in consumer demand, but it's really far too early to say that that's going to continue. Margins are continuing to be challenged. So we're seeing red load spread there still. So even with that improvement of demand, it's not translating yet into improved spreads. So -- we're watching that very closely, of course, P.J.\nP.J. Juvekar: And the situation on PO is no different than on the situation of polyolefins?\nKenneth Lane : Correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne : I wanted to just drill into the EAI segment here. Is the EBITDA loss-making a result of just the fixed cost absorption of running at 60% or were cash margins negative in the region in the quarter? And Ken, you mentioned demand improving. Is that sufficient to drive operating rates from 60% to 80%. Do you think that margins will remain stable? Or do you see risk of that given others may restart with lower and lower energy costs as well?\nKenneth Lane : Thank you, Steve. Good question. And the other aspect that I would add, I mean, to what you -- to your question is, of course, also on the energy costs. As you know, I mean, energy costs have also moderated on a still very high level. [indiscernible] factor of 8 more expensive versus the United States, but at least, I mean, we're not at that peak anymore also helped them by the winter that has been very moderate so far in Europe. So I would hand over -- I mean, to give a bit more color to what is happening in the market to Ken.\nKenneth Lane : Yes. Thank you. And just to remind you, we did have that LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of $50 million. So -- but looking at what we see coming out of the fourth quarter, we hit a very low point there because demand was coming off, energy costs were high. They moderated at the end of the quarter, and we're seeing that continue in the first quarter. We also had our [indiscernible] fracker down during the fourth quarter. So -- that's why our operating rates were lower. Those repairs are complete, the fracker is back up. Similar to what we see in China, we're seeing some improvement in consumer demand. But again, I would say it's still early. Let's not call it a win yet, but we're definitely seeing some early signs of consumer demand improving there. So overall, the margin environment is going to improve mainly because of what Peter had said around the energy costs.\nOperator: Our next quarter comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho Securities.\nChristopher Parkinson: Great. Could you just give your outlook on various regional operating rates and what's been happening across NGL and feedstocks? Could you just give us your latest update on the NGL front and what that just generally means for the progression of integrated [PE] margins throughout the year?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Chris. Ken, do you want to?\nKenneth Lane : Sure. Yes, I'll take that. Listen, NGL production continues to increase. So we expect that to be a tailwind, especially for our position here in North America. The oil and gas ratio is going to be continue -- or continue to be favorable for our portfolio. We don't see that really changing. We do expect there could be some strengthening in the oil price as we go through the year just as demand potentially comes back with China reopening. So all in all, I would say that the environment today should be better than where we were in the second half of last year around feedstock synergy in our portfolio.\nPeter Vanacker: And I think nat gas, I mean, [indiscernible] to $40 back to where it was in the first half of 2021.\nOperator: Our next question comes from line of John McNulty from BMO Capital Markets.\nBhavesh Lodaya: This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. You highlighted improving operating rates in North America in the first quarter. As we think about 2023, what type of U.S. domestic demand growth do you expect? And then as we think about like a further recovery in operating rates back to like historical levels, how much of that depends on rising exports and reducing some of the logistic constraints out there?\nPeter Vanacker: It's a very broad question, of course. I mean, let me try to digest to put it in different buckets here. I mean, needless to say that when we talk about the demand for mature goods with high inflation rates, which are still high with interest rates that continue to go up with new house builds and houses being sold still being very -- a very low base, yes, it's clear that we expect that the demand for durable goods will continue to be at least for the foreseeable future depressed. What we have seen on the other hand side, as we have seen in other cycles, is that demand for nondurable goods is relatively stable, not to say, I mean, in certain areas, even strong. So that has led to the fact that we have given this guidance that we say, I mean, we are now operating in the Americas at 80% utilization. And Ken already talked about the European utilization rates, which was [indiscernible] at 80%. In the I&D, I mean, you know that we have a start-up of the PO/TBA sands, as we alluded to and Kim said, starting up at the end of this quarter, which will add, I mean, a bit more volumes of propylene oxide -- but let's not overreact on that either because we have, of course, our scheduled shutdowns, turnarounds that we have moved to the periods when we are starting up, I mean, the new facilities. Stock we'll be able to grow a bit, but operating assets currently is at 80%. Also here, a tick higher than it was at the end of last year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeff Zekauskas: A two-part question. When you think about the shutdown of your refinery at the end of 2023, does that mean that there are reduced operating rates in the fourth quarter of 2023? That is, do you have to really prepare to shut it down or you get to the end of the year and you shut it down? Second question is, you gave a sensitivity to natural gas price changes. You said every dollar per MMBtu is [$175 million]. And you said 20% is in Europe. So that's roughly 35 million MMBtus. The European gas price today is maybe $17 an MMBtu. And last year, it averaged $37. So it's down $20. $20 times 35, $700 million. So is that the benefit for 2023 if gas prices in Europe stay where they are relative to last year? Have I done the calculation correctly?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Jeff. Very good questions. I mean, talking about the refinery, as we have said, I mean, we want to shut down the refinery in Houston by the end of 2023. So that has not changed in our opinion. The rationale for that has not changed either. And of course, there is some preparation that needs to be done in order to be hydrocarbon free by the end of the year. So Kim, if you want to add something on that question?\nKimberly Foley : I would just tell the audience that we're working through the detailed plans of how to do that. As you alluded, you can do that with a slow ramp down? Or are you going to do that by just pulling the plug on the 31st [of the year], and we're working through the different scenarios to make sure that we have the most efficient an effective shutdown in clearing process.\nPeter Vanacker: Answer your second question, of course, I mean, if you just do the math, then you make up to that conclusion. But let's not forget that in Europe, our teams have done an excellent job by also increasing prices on one hand side, on the other hand side, also implementing energy surcharges. So you can't actually net that out the way you did, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Congrats, Michael and David on the Institutional Investor Magazine recognition, well deserved. Michael, you made good progress on working capital in 2022, and I'm wondering what the expectation is for 2023. And in terms of uses of cash, there was a breather on buybacks here in the fourth quarter. CapEx is coming down in '23. What are your thoughts in terms of a resumption of the buybacks?\nMichael McMurray : So good question. So I think, first, I mean I just -- I'd point out again that the cash generation in 2022 was extremely strong. Excellent execution by the businesses from a working capital perspective during the year. In the fourth quarter, in particular, longer-term perspective as well. Kind of turning to this year and looking forward, I would say that, I think, first and foremost, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. And you all know that we have a reputation for generating strong cash flow and returning to gain cash flow to our shareholders, and that expectation has not changed. Thinking specifically about 2023, I would point out that CapEx is going to be down materially. So expectations for capital is about $1.5 billion. It is going to be a tale of 2 halves for this year with an expectation that the second half gets stronger. As we move here into the first quarter, it's my expectation that working capital should be flattish. But as I look towards the balance of the year, I actually hope to consume some working capital with better sales and better pricing. And then remember, our growth investments are starting to pay dividends as well, in particular, with the start-up of PO/TBA. And so again, as I think about the full year, it's my expectation, and I'm looking at Peter and he's nodding at me. But we will continue to return meaningful cash to shareholders, including growing our recurring dividend.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Shifting back to polyethylene. Could you give us what you anticipate a reasonable range of outcomes is for Chinese polyethylene demand growth during 2023? And how much of that you think will need to be sourced from the ex-China market? And if you also had a view on what their demand growth actually turned out to be in 2022, that would be helpful.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, Vincent. Ken is already close to that. So...\nKenneth Lane : Yes, we are very close to that. Vincent, thank you for the question. Look, our view for the last 2 years is the demand for polyethylene in China has been relatively flat. So when you talk about a range of outcomes for 2023, if you look historically, after 2 years like that, you would expect to see a significant snapback in growth, but it doesn't mean that that's a guarantee. So you could see anything from flat to plus 8%. It's very hard to call. That's why that's one of the markets that we watch very closely just because it is largely the price that are in the market. And will drive the absorption of all the new capacity that has come on. But we'll watch it closely and hope to see some more signs of recovery in the near future and more to come.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: I have a long-winded question. So U.S. ethylene and polyethylene capacity has -- there's a cost advantage. And there's long-standing thesis that due to cost advantage, U.S. can export to anywhere in the world almost as much as necessary. It's not what's happening right now, right? You and the rest of the industry has lower capacity utilization. So why is there not an increase in export? Is it not economical or other logistical limitations that don't allow it? And could this change as we go through 2023 such that your utilization rates go up due to higher exports and there's no imbalance in the domestic market as a result?\nKenneth Lane : Alex, this is Ken. I'll take that question. We've -- during the quarter, we actually did see both as an industry but in LyondellBasell as well an increase in exports. Some of that was related to some improvement in demand overseas, some less imports coming into some of the closer markets like South America from other regions. But also the relief of some of those [indiscernible] logistics constraints that we were dealing with in the first 3 quarters of the year, it really started to free up in the fourth quarter. So I think that you're going to start to see that continue in the first quarter and we'll get back to a more normal level of exports for 2023.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Richard on for Mike. Just wanted to touch on the value enhancement program. You've identified $150 million in cost savings for 2023. I know we're probably going to get more details on the call Markets Day. But any details early on in terms of what you've able to identify where are the buckets of savings are coming from? And then also just the cadence of the savings through this year would be great.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, Richard. This is Peter. Good question. The process -- I mean, the value enhancement program is ramping up quite impressively, I must say. We've done the major sites in the United States. And since the beginning of the year -- I mean the 2 major sites actually in Germany. We're expanding now also to other sites as we speak during the next quarters, both in the United States as well as in Europe. more than 3,000 projects that have been identified so far. And it goes, I mean, from areas in the manufacturing side to procurements to commercial excellence, supply chain management. So it's a very broad portfolio of different projects. We will give a couple of examples during the Capital Markets Day to make it more tangible. Today, we are mainly focusing on projects that have a very fast payback time, not so much projects that add and increase capacity, which is logical if you look at where the market is, but it is a continuous stage gate process that we have, where we continue to prioritize projects based upon the returns and based upon what we are seeing in the marketplace. So stay tuned, I would say, to get more specifics on a couple of examples on the 14th of March at the Capital Markets Day.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.\nDuffy Fischer: Two quick questions. One, in the increase in your operating rates across segments, does that contemplate some inventory build for the summer season? Or does that also -- or do you see that as kind of sell-through as well for Q1? And then on the polymers for Americas, what -- or what's your plan, I guess, for the split between U.S. sold and export this year versus next year? Do you have to improve your export percent meaningfully with the new capacity in North America?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Duffy. I mean, let me split it up in 2 parts on your working capital question on the inventory question. First of all, Kim will give a bit of overview on the PO side. And then Kim can also talk about the olefins, polyolefins.\nKimberly Foley : Thank you, Peter. So as it relates to the propylene oxide side, yes, we're building a a slight bit of working capital as a contingency for the startup. But once the startup is successful, which we have tremendous confidence in that inventory level will come down. And we expect throughout the year to operate at about 85% capacity based on the modest demand we see in propylene oxide right now.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. So I talk a little bit about O&P, and I want to just echo what Michael. It's -- the teams have done an outstanding job in the fourth quarter managing our assets to be able to maximize cash flow and really focused on producing the products that we need to deliver with customers. We'll continue to do that going forward as we see markets improve, we will increase our operating rates to match that, and that may end up as Michael said, in markets taking working capital, but that's a good thing because we're going to have a stronger business as a result. But I'm just very proud of the team and everything that they did to manage that during the fourth quarter, which was quite a difficult time. To your question around increase in exports, we're going to continue to to see an increase in exports, I think, in general from the United States market or from the Gulf Coast market, just with all the new capacity coming on. As a company, we have been increasing the portion of exports for us as we ramp up the capacity with the new hypers assets. We're going to continue to see that happen. But clearly, our strategy around channels to market is to find the highest value customers and segments and that tends to be closer to home. So we're always trying to find more business here and we use the exports to really optimize the portfolio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy: Can you discuss your view of the U.S. polyethylene contract pricing opportunities seems as though spot export prices have come up appreciably year-to-date, while producer inventory has been rationalized to some extent. So perhaps you can talk through what you're seeking currently and your level of confidence that will turn the corner and start to see contract prices move higher as the first quarter progresses?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Kevin. Well, it's clear that we continue to have price increases out there in the U.S. market. And we're hopeful that these price increases, we see at least there is a good development in the marketplace. Ken?\nKenneth Lane : Yes. So look, I'm confident we've seen strength in the export market that we did not see last year. So that's a good indication. And I think I mentioned this on the third quarter earnings call, we've sort of seen prices come down to all those parity with export pricing. So as you see exports go up, you should see domestic prices moving up, and I'm confident then the first quarter, we're going to see some increases here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line Joshua Spector with UBS.\nJoshua Spector: Just on APS, I'd just be curious if you want to comment on what the normalized earnings of that residual business is -- I mean, if you move $200 million over, I think even looking prepandemic, maybe there's $200 million in residual, like $250 million residual. Schulman used to be about $200 million, and you've got some synergies on top of that. So curious if you could give us some color there.\nPeter Vanacker: Definitely very good question, Josh. And this is one of the reasons why we have repositioned this APS business as well because we are, of course, not happy at all with the results in the APS business. And yes, there are lots of factors that they roll on market demand and higher costs that we have seen last year, energy cost feedstock costs -- so therefore, we have decided to mic reposition this business. And [indiscernible] like run it as a separate company within LyondellBasell. Michael, do you want to add?\nMichael McMurray : Yes. Peter, first, I just want to say and express that I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the Advanced bottomer solutions business through the transformation that we're embarking on. And I see a lot of potential in this business. And I put it in place a team that I think really can deliver. And the steps that we're taking, this Catalloy and [PB-1], or polybutenes or where that we're -- we really view [indiscernible] as a better fit in the O&P segment. This enables the new, what I call the new APS, to be very focused on our core value-creating model of compounding and customer solutions for brand owners and OEMs. We did well on the integration and cost reductions, but our APS business needs a much more customer-centric operating model. And this is going to be part of the journey that we are now embarking on it with the transformation. And our focused improvements in customer intimacy, technical support and service levels I think will really allow us to fix this business and grow it in a profitable way. And I'm looking forward to share more about this transformation journey at the Capital Markets Day coming up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter : Peter, on your Circulen volumes, what are the price premiums you\u2019re receiving and what types of margins are you realizing on these Circulen volumes?\nA \u2013Peter Vanacker: Yes. Good question, of course. As we go into the markets with an entire portfolio, so we have a reasonable part of the portfolio, we have the circular part of the portfolio, which is either mechanical recycled or advanced recycled. We are in the market \u2013 I mean, with the entire family. Yvonne will give more insights in our go-to market during the Capital Markets Day also with our aspirations that we have by having set up this strategic business units, Currently, this is a market which is extremely short. Demand is substantially higher than the supply in the market. So we\u2019re completely sold out in the products that we have available. The premiums that we are getting are quite attractive. Yes. I\u2019m not going to put a number on it as we speak. You\u2019ve heard numbers, I mean, from other calls. And I can say we are at least on that level. That said, Yvonne will be more insights on the aspirations that we have during the Capital Markets Day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you very much, and thanks again. Very good questions, very thoughtful questions. And once again, I hope that you will join us on March 14 as we will then share how LyondellBasell will advance on our strategy and unlock substantial value over the coming years. As we have said in the prepared comments for this call, we have not waited until the Capital Markets Day. We have already put a lot of things into action. And the purpose of the Capital Markets Day is to go deeper into the more specifics on the different pillars of our new strategy. I wish you all a great weekend, and as usual, stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Kenneth Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Fourth quarter O&P Americas EBITDA was $359 million. Prices and margins stabilized at the low levels we saw at the end of the third quarter. Market demand declined, and we also saw customer destocking during the quarter. That, combined with new polymer capacity resulted in well-supplied markets. We operated our assets at approximately 75% of nameplate capacity to match the reduced market demand and manage working capital. During January, we have seen modest improvements in domestic and export demand. Normalization of logistics constraints have facilitated increased export volumes. Also, moderating feedstock and energy costs are providing some margin tailwinds. As a result, we expect to operate our O&P Americas asset at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter. Looking back at 2022, I want to highlight our progress on developing our Circulen business. We have established projects for classic waste sorting facilities that will be used to provide feedstock for our circular recover and certain the Revive product lines. We are also moving phoned our usage of olefins feedstocks produced from renewable sources such as used cooking oil. During 2022, we processed 15,000 tons of renewable feedstocks at our Channelview, Texas cracker, to produce ethylene, propylene and ultimately, polyethylene and polypropylene that we sold to customers at premium prices under our Circular brand. Last year, 4 of our U.S. manufacturing sites attained the ISCC Plus certification for certain grades of polyethylene and polypropylene. This enables LyondellBasell to offer customers mass balance certificates for these products and serve the market's rapidly growing demand. We are delivering these new circular new products to our customers and proving that polymers can be more sustainable and used in any application where virgin polymer is used. Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment. In Europe, macroeconomic pressures were exacerbated by high inflation and energy costs that curtailed operations at our customers and pressured consumer demand. LyondellBasell operated our O&P assets at rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter. LIFO inventory charges were $50 million during the quarter. All of this combined to result in a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $152 million. European energy costs have considerably moderated in January, and demand is showing some signs of improvement over the extremely low level seen in December. We have completed repairs and we started our integrated cracker in France at the end of 2022 and expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 80% during the first quarter. As in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies to support our Circulen and Low Carbon Solutions business in Europe and Asia. During October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China, and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India. These partnerships will allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose plants in each region to supply feedstocks for our circular products has served a rapidly growing market for circular solutions. In November, we announced our decision to move forward with engineering to build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. This plant will utilize LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec technology to convert plastic waste from our waste sorting facility into pyrolysis oil that can be used as a feedstock to produce new plastic resins in a circular process. We are moving rapidly to build circular and low-carbon solutions for our industry at an unmatched scale.  With that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Yes, that's right. We continue to operate the joint venture of technical minimums. We've seen -- in two weeks, we're seeing a little bit of improvement in consumer demand, but it's really far too early to say that that's going to continue. Margins are continuing to be challenged. So we're seeing red load spread there still. So even with that improvement of demand, it's not translating yet into improved spreads. So -- we're watching that very closely, of course, P.J. Correct. Thank you, Steve. Good question. And the other aspect that I would add, I mean, to what you -- to your question is, of course, also on the energy costs. As you know, I mean, energy costs have also moderated on a still very high level. [indiscernible] factor of 8 more expensive versus the United States, but at least, I mean, we're not at that peak anymore also helped them by the winter that has been very moderate so far in Europe. So I would hand over -- I mean, to give a bit more color to what is happening in the market to Ken. Yes. Thank you. And just to remind you, we did have that LIFO charge in the fourth quarter of $50 million. So -- but looking at what we see coming out of the fourth quarter, we hit a very low point there because demand was coming off, energy costs were high. They moderated at the end of the quarter, and we're seeing that continue in the first quarter. We also had our [indiscernible] fracker down during the fourth quarter. So -- that's why our operating rates were lower. Those repairs are complete, the fracker is back up. Similar to what we see in China, we're seeing some improvement in consumer demand. But again, I would say it's still early. Let's not call it a win yet, but we're definitely seeing some early signs of consumer demand improving there. So overall, the margin environment is going to improve mainly because of what Peter had said around the energy costs. Sure. Yes, I'll take that. Listen, NGL production continues to increase. So we expect that to be a tailwind, especially for our position here in North America. The oil and gas ratio is going to be continue -- or continue to be favorable for our portfolio. We don't see that really changing. We do expect there could be some strengthening in the oil price as we go through the year just as demand potentially comes back with China reopening. So all in all, I would say that the environment today should be better than where we were in the second half of last year around feedstock synergy in our portfolio. Yes, we are very close to that. Vincent, thank you for the question. Look, our view for the last 2 years is the demand for polyethylene in China has been relatively flat. So when you talk about a range of outcomes for 2023, if you look historically, after 2 years like that, you would expect to see a significant snapback in growth, but it doesn't mean that that's a guarantee. So you could see anything from flat to plus 8%. It's very hard to call. That's why that's one of the markets that we watch very closely just because it is largely the price that are in the market. And will drive the absorption of all the new capacity that has come on. But we'll watch it closely and hope to see some more signs of recovery in the near future and more to come. Alex, this is Ken.

            "name": "Kimberly Foley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our intermediates and Derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $291 million. Styrene margins improved due to lower feedstock costs. Oxyfuel margins remained well above historical fourth quarter averages. Oxyfuel volumes declined as the timing of the vessel sailings resulted in unusually high third quarter volumes. We operated our assets at rates of approximately 75%. Our propylene oxide and styrene joint venture in the Netherlands is expected to restart this month after 3 months of downtime in response to volatile European energy costs and lower demand. We look forward to initial volumes from the new PO/TBA asset in Houston by the end of the quarter. We plan to operate our assets across the IND segment at approximately 80% in the first quarter. In January, we are encouraged by unseasonably strong oxyfuel margins with low butane feedstock costs and strong oxyfuel blend premiums. We expect relatively stable margins for the segment for the first quarter. We developed multiyear maintenance schedules to ensure that our plants can safely and reliably serve our customers. As it works out, 2023 will be a heavy year for maintenance across several of our PO/TBA assets. Maintenance is scheduled for 2 of our 3 PO/TBA plants at our Bayport, Texas facility in the second and fourth quarters. Our [indiscernible] PO/TBA facility in the Netherlands will also undergo maintenance from September through November. We expect the ramp-up in volumes of our new plant will be partially offset by loss production from this planned maintenance. Nonetheless, the incremental 2023 PO and TBA volumes should be sufficient to capture typical market growth. In 2024, we expect less scheduled maintenance and the full year of production from our new assets will provide additional volumes to serve market growth. Now let's turn to Slide 15 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $40 million. Results increased on higher margins and slightly higher volumes following the third of the planned maintenances, offset by the disruptions of the December freeze. In the fourth quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread modestly increased to $48 per barrel, remaining well above historical averages. Despite unplanned downtime, we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 229,000 barrels per day. In January, the Maya 2-1-1 spreads have also been unseasonally strong at more than $50 per barrel, driven by strong discounts for heavy crudes. We expect to operate the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity in the first quarter. Finally, I would like to recognize our team at the refinery for finishing the year with 0 recordable injuries in 2022. This is the first time such a record has been achieved in the 104-year history of this facility. Our team is dedicated to safely and reliably operating these assets until we exit the business.  With that, I will turn it over to Torkel. I would just tell the audience that we're working through the detailed plans of how to do that. As you alluded, you can do that with a slow ramp down? Or are you going to do that by just pulling the plug on the 31st [of the year], and we're working through the different scenarios to make sure that we have the most efficient an effective shutdown in clearing process. Thank you, Peter. So as it relates to the propylene oxide side, yes, we're building a a slight bit of working capital as a contingency for the startup. But once the startup is successful, which we have tremendous confidence in that inventory level will come down. And we expect throughout the year to operate at about 85% capacity based on the modest demand we see in propylene oxide right now."

Let's begin with our safety results on Slide number 3. LyondellBasell's employees and contractors delivered an outstanding safety performance during 2022. Injury rates at our company have consistently been among the lowest for our industry. But last year, we reduced the rate of injuries across our global workforce by roughly [0.5] to 0.12 injuries per 200,000 hours worked. At our Bayport complex outside of Houston, our team finished 2022 with over 6 million consecutive safe work hours, a new company record. Simply put, a consistent focus on safe work is embedded in our company's DNA and provides a solid foundation for extending that shared focus across other dimensions of the company's culture. Let's now turn to Slide number 4 to discuss our financial results. 2022 was a very challenging year characterized by a war in Ukraine, evolving responses to the COVID pandemic, energy volatility, inflation and rapidly changing monetary policies. At LyondellBasell, our portfolio of businesses continued to provide value for our global customers with products and solutions that are essential for modern society. In '22, LyondellBasell delivered earnings of $12.46 per share with EBITDA of $6.5 billion. Cash generation was exceptional and resulted in $6.1 billion of cash from operations; second only to our 2021 results. We ended the year with $6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment rate balance sheet. Interim invested capital was 16%, far exceeding our cost of capital. In addition to our focus on safety, we are sharpening our strategic focus to maximize value for our customers, shareholders and society under a range of scenarios. On Slide number 5, we outlined our progress on delivering value from this strategy over the past year. Our leadership in cost management and operational excellence enabled LyondellBasell to hold fixed costs well below inflation, and quickly adjust operating rates in response to evolving market conditions. Our diverse global business portfolio provided outstanding cash generation during a challenging year. And at the same time, we positioned the portfolio for changing times with decisions to exit refining and sell our Australian polypropylene business. We established a new business unit, focused on establishing leadership in providing circular and low-carbon solutions for our customers. And we are advancing our supply chains, production capacity and sustainable assets to serve rapidly growing markets for these circular and low-carbon products. Last quarter, we announced our increased focus on capturing value as we continue to manage costs. We expect our value enhancement program will generate at least $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Our increased focus helped drive a [13 percent point] improvement in cash conversion in 2022. That further bolstered our capital structure and supported generous shareholder returns. On Slide number 6, I would like to highlight our recent decisions to accelerate progress on our climate targets and create more value by doing so. In order to meet the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, climate scientists believe that global warming should be limited to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. In December, we announced our decision to increase LyondellBasell's 2030 targets for reducing scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions to 42% and established a new Scope 3 emission reduction target of 30% relative to 2020 levels. Targets are now aligned with the science-based guidance and the 1.5 degree Celsius scenario. In addition, as we continue to make progress in sourcing, favorably priced renewable electricity, we have increased our 2030 goal to procure at least 75% of our global power generation needs from renewable and low-carbon sources. Earlier this week, we announced our first 2 renewable power purchase agreements in Europe and 2 additional agreements in the United States. Altogether, we now have 8 agreements in place for 930 megawatts of renewable power capacity, which represents roughly 1/3 of our global needs. These agreements will prevent nearly 1 million tons of annual greenhouse gas emissions. All of this work supports our goal to become net zero in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2050. At the same time, we continued to build global businesses that will sell at least 2 million tons of recycled and renewable base polymers by 2030. On Slide number 7, let's take a look at how we are building our Circle brands of recycled and renewable base polymers. During the fourth quarter, we announced progress in developing 4 new plastic waste sorting and recycling facilities in Houston, Germany, India and China. These facilities provide a strong foundation for a robust global supply chain for plastic grade feedstocks. And with our 3 product platforms, CirculenRecover for mechanical recycling, CirculenRevive for advanced recycling, and CirculenRenew for renewable-based feedstocks, LyondellBasell will be able to match feedstocks and products with the highest value solutions for our customers. The combination of our focus, detail, technologies and global platforms provides LyondellBasell with powerful advantages to build the world's leading circular and low-carbon Solutions business.  Now with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Torkel. And to the entire LyondellBasell team, thank you again for all the hard work in delivering strong results during a challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, reduced global polyolefin industry operating rates resulted in lower catalyst volumes, licensing revenue moderated due to the timing of milestones for revenue recognition. We estimate that the first quarter results for the Technology segment will be similar to fourth quarter 2022 as catalyst volumes improve, offset by moderating licensing revenue. Our technology team is hard at work advancing engineering on LyondellBasell's first commercial advanced recycling plant. This plant will leverage on proprietary MoReTec technology to extract sale from most consumer mixed plastic waste by closing the loop and producing feedstocks for our Italian crackers. Our technology provides distinct advantages by reducing energy consumption, improving yields through innovative process designs and catalysis. Let me now summarize our results and first quarter outlook with Slide 18. Despite highly targets, our team is capturing value and moving forward on our strategic priorities. Most importantly, we are sharpening our focus on leveraging the scale of our clear portfolio to deliver resilient results. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. Last year's outstanding safety performance speaks to the depth with which safety is ingrained in our corporate culture. Our goal is to expand our core petro foundations to encompass a more comprehensive passion for value creation. This week, we welcomed Trisha Conley to our Executive Committee as Executive Vice President, People and Culture. Trisha will play a pivotal role in leading LyondellBasell's vision and strategy to enhance the employee experience, elevate our organizational performance and create the best and most inspiring culture in our industry. In 2022, our businesses were pressured by the effects of the war, volatile energy costs emergence from the pandemic and monetary policy. We responded by matching our reduction with changing demand, leveraging our global business portfolio and maximizing cash generation. Over the past year, our businesses generated over $6 billion of cash from operations and returned $3.7 billion to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases. Lander focus and commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. The more annuity formed circular and carbon solutions business, we are laser-focused on meeting the needs of our customers, brand owners and society. Our decarbonization goals are now aligned with science-based guidance, and we have made substantial progress towards our 2030 goal to procure 75% of our electricity from renewable and low-carbon sources. The Circular and Low Carbon Solutions business is well positioned to address the challenges of sustainability and plastic waste. By building an end-to-end business with robust supply chains, proprietary technology for transforming materials and our global manufacturing and marketing network, we're confident that we can build a large-scale and valuable leadership position in this exciting and expanding market. And our focus on sustainability is gaining recognition. In December, we were honored to be awarded the EcoVadis Gold Medal for sustainability performance with a 91st percentile ranking. The EcoVadis platform is valued by procurement professionals for assisting in the identification and evaluation of sustainable supply solutions. We expect modest improvements in the first quarter from moderating energy and feedstock costs, stable demand and the absence of fourth quarter life for charges. Normalizing supply chains or enabling improved trade flows from our advantaged feedstock positions in North America and the Middle East. Nonetheless, we will continue to maintain focus and discipline to ensure that operating rates across our global portfolio are matched to market conditions. As the year progresses, we anticipate seasonal demand improvements during the second and third quarter. And we're keeping a close eye on China's emergence from Covet and potential benefits from increased economic activity during the second half of 2023. The most exciting challenge during my first 8 months as the CEO of LyondellBasell has been the process of identifying and building a compelling strategy that generates substantial value for our customers, suppliers, employees, communities and shareholders over the next decade. We've shared some initial decisions with you already, but much more is ahead. As you will have recognized, we have waited until the Capital Markets Day, but started moving ahead with great focus and speed in the right direction. On Slide 19, we ask that you save the date for March 14, when we will share more details on our forward strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York, and we hope that you can all join us virtually or in person.  We are now pleased to take your questions. Thanks, P.J. This is Peter. Let me take your question first and then potentially Ken can also add to that. When we talk about China, it's still early stage to say that we see a sustainable recovery. We expect -- I mean that, that will take probably another 3, 4 months until we see that recovery is actually happening. So we're still very modest in our expectations on China. But at least, I mean, we know that there has been the opening. So the government has changed their way. I mean, how to look at that -- at COVID. And Bora, still hanging in there, I would say. Not very positive because of the situation and because of capacity utilization rates locally in the market being at technical minimums. Ken? Thank you, Chris. Ken, do you want to? And I think nat gas, I mean, [indiscernible] to $40 back to where it was in the first half of 2021. It's a very broad question, of course. I mean, let me try to digest to put it in different buckets here. I mean, needless to say that when we talk about the demand for mature goods with high inflation rates, which are still high with interest rates that continue to go up with new house builds and houses being sold still being very -- a very low base, yes, it's clear that we expect that the demand for durable goods will continue to be at least for the foreseeable future depressed. What we have seen on the other hand side, as we have seen in other cycles, is that demand for nondurable goods is relatively stable, not to say, I mean, in certain areas, even strong. So that has led to the fact that we have given this guidance that we say, I mean, we are now operating in the Americas at 80% utilization. And Ken already talked about the European utilization rates, which was [indiscernible] at 80%. In the I&D, I mean, you know that we have a start-up of the PO/TBA sands, as we alluded to and Kim said, starting up at the end of this quarter, which will add, I mean, a bit more volumes of propylene oxide -- but let's not overreact on that either because we have, of course, our scheduled shutdowns, turnarounds that we have moved to the periods when we are starting up, I mean, the new facilities. Stock we'll be able to grow a bit, but operating assets currently is at 80%. Also here, a tick higher than it was at the end of last year. Thank you, Jeff. Very good questions. I mean, talking about the refinery, as we have said, I mean, we want to shut down the refinery in Houston by the end of 2023. So that has not changed in our opinion. The rationale for that has not changed either. And of course, there is some preparation that needs to be done in order to be hydrocarbon free by the end of the year. So Kim, if you want to add something on that question? Answer your second question, of course, I mean, if you just do the math, then you make up to that conclusion. But let's not forget that in Europe, our teams have done an excellent job by also increasing prices on one hand side, on the other hand side, also implementing energy surcharges. So you can't actually net that out the way you did, Jeff. Yes. Thank you, Vincent. Ken is already close to that. So... Yes. Thank you, Richard. This is Peter. Good question. The process -- I mean, the value enhancement program is ramping up quite impressively, I must say. We've done the major sites in the United States. And since the beginning of the year -- I mean the 2 major sites actually in Germany. We're expanding now also to other sites as we speak during the next quarters, both in the United States as well as in Europe. more than 3,000 projects that have been identified so far. And it goes, I mean, from areas in the manufacturing side to procurements to commercial excellence, supply chain management. So it's a very broad portfolio of different projects. We will give a couple of examples during the Capital Markets Day to make it more tangible. Today, we are mainly focusing on projects that have a very fast payback time, not so much projects that add and increase capacity, which is logical if you look at where the market is, but it is a continuous stage gate process that we have, where we continue to prioritize projects based upon the returns and based upon what we are seeing in the marketplace. So stay tuned, I would say, to get more specifics on a couple of examples on the 14th of March at the Capital Markets Day. Thank you, Duffy. I mean, let me split it up in 2 parts on your working capital question on the inventory question. First of all, Kim will give a bit of overview on the PO side. And then Kim can also talk about the olefins, polyolefins. Yes. So I talk a little bit about O&P, and I want to just echo what Michael. It's -- the teams have done an outstanding job in the fourth quarter managing our assets to be able to maximize cash flow and really focused on producing the products that we need to deliver with customers. We'll continue to do that going forward as we see markets improve, we will increase our operating rates to match that, and that may end up as Michael said, in markets taking working capital, but that's a good thing because we're going to have a stronger business as a result. But I'm just very proud of the team and everything that they did to manage that during the fourth quarter, which was quite a difficult time. To your question around increase in exports, we're going to continue to to see an increase in exports, I think, in general from the United States market or from the Gulf Coast market, just with all the new capacity coming on. As a company, we have been increasing the portion of exports for us as we ramp up the capacity with the new hypers assets. We're going to continue to see that happen. But clearly, our strategy around channels to market is to find the highest value customers and segments and that tends to be closer to home. So we're always trying to find more business here and we use the exports to really optimize the portfolio. Thank you, Kevin. Well, it's clear that we continue to have price increases out there in the U.S. market. And we're hopeful that these price increases, we see at least there is a good development in the marketplace. Ken? Definitely very good question, Josh. And this is one of the reasons why we have repositioned this APS business as well because we are, of course, not happy at all with the results in the APS business. And yes, there are lots of factors that they roll on market demand and higher costs that we have seen last year, energy cost feedstock costs -- so therefore, we have decided to mic reposition this business. And [indiscernible] like run it as a separate company within LyondellBasell. Michael, do you want to add? Thank you very much, and thanks again. Very good questions, very thoughtful questions. And once again, I hope that you will join us on March 14 as we will then share how LyondellBasell will advance on our strategy and unlock substantial value over the coming years. As we have said in the prepared comments for this call, we have not waited until the Capital Markets Day. We have already put a lot of things into action. And the purpose of the Capital Markets Day is to go deeper into the more specifics on the different pillars of our new strategy. I wish you all a great weekend, and as usual, stay safe."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by highlighting our excellent cash generation from our business portfolio during 2022. LyondellBasell generated a total of $6.1 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Our cash on hand increased to $2.2 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2022, we achieved cash conversion of 96%, 13 percentage points higher than our 2021 cash conversion. In the fourth quarter, cash conversion reached an outstanding rate of 203%. This efficient and robust cash generation allowed the company to return a total of $3.7 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2022. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. Our approach remains focused on disciplined capital allocation and strong returns for our shareholders. During 2022, cash from operating activities fully funded dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. We returned approximately 60% of the cash from operating activities to shareholders. This included $3.2 billion in quarterly and special dividends and $420 million in share repurchases. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%. This represents our 12th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $1.9 billion in capital expenditures. A significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction of our world-scale PO/TBA plant. Startup activities remain on track for the end of this quarter. Our transformation of is working across our company to rigorously manage and track the progress of our value enhancement program. We look forward to sharing the progress of this program at our Capital Markets Day in March. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $865 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our results reflected margins stabilizing at the low levels seen towards the end of the third quarter. Moderating energy and feedstock costs provided modest offsets for compressed margins in our olefins and polyolefins businesses. Overall, OMP demand remained low, particularly in Europe and China. Intermediates and Derivatives results sequentially declined on lower volumes due to the quarterly timing of oxyfuel vessel shipments. Margins at our oxyfuels and refining businesses remained above historical averages as demand for fuels remained strong due to increasing global mobility. High cost for utilities and raw materials coupled with low seasonal demand negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge impacts pretax fourth quarter results by approximately $90 million. Fourth quarter LIFO charges were approximately $15 million for O&P Americas segment, $50 million for the O&P [EII] segment each for the intermediates and derivatives in APS segments, $15 million for the Technology segment and a $40 million benefit for the refining segment. As a reminder, volatility in natural gas prices impacts our cost for not only gas, but also steam and electricity. We estimate that a $1 per million BTU change in the price of natural gas impacts the energy cost of our directly operated assets by approximately $175 million per year across the company with 80% of this impact in North America and 20% in Europe. These estimates do not include the impact of gas price on feedstock cost. Before I turn the call over to Ken and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our segment results in more detail, let me address some of your annual modeling questions for 2023 on Slide 11. As our new world-scale PO/TBA plant ramps up, we expect to produce and sell about half of the asset's nameplate capacity in 2023. We remain confident that our value enhancement program can achieve recurring annual EBITDA of $150 million by the end of 2023 through the execution of about 1,000 projects. In order to achieve this benefit, we expect to incur a similar amount of onetime capital and operational cost of about $150 million, with the majority of these costs allocated to capital. Major planned maintenance for 2023 included a turnaround at one of our Midwest ethylene crackers in the O&P Americas segment, turnarounds at our acetyls assets and 3 propylene oxide plant turnarounds within our I&D segment. Based on expected volumes and margins, we estimate that lost production associated with all of this maintenance downtime will impact 2023 EBITDA and by approximately $290 million. While routine maintenance costs are expensed, maintenance costs arising from turnarounds of major production units are capitalized and included in our capital expenditure forecast. During the fourth quarter, we recognized costs related to the exit from our refining business, which impacted EBITDA by $73 million. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect the business will incur similar EBITDA impacts during each quarter of 2023. We will also recognize about $55 million each quarter for depreciation charges to reflect cost accrued for asset decommissioning that will be incurred after the asset shuts down. We expect that our capital expenditures will decline by about $300 million to approximately $1.6 billion this year with the completion of the PO/TBA plant and disciplined spend resulting from the current business environment. Approximately $500 million of CapEx is targeted towards profit-generating growth projects with the remaining balance supporting sustaining maintenance. We expect that this year's capital requirements for the value enhancement program will be funded within our $1.6 billion CapEx budget. Other financial metrics worth noting include net interest expense, depreciation and amortization, pension related estimates and tax rates. We expect 2023 net interest expense will be approximately $405 million. Depreciation and amortization charges for 2023 are expected to be $1.4 billion, which includes the [$202 million] of additional refinery depreciation charges related to asset decommissioning. We plan to make regular pension contributions in 2023, totaling about $65 million with approximately $105 million of pension expense for the year. We expect our effective tax rate will be approximately 20% and our cash tax rate will be lower than our ETR.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? So good question. So I think, first, I mean I just -- I'd point out again that the cash generation in 2022 was extremely strong. Excellent execution by the businesses from a working capital perspective during the year. In the fourth quarter, in particular, longer-term perspective as well. Kind of turning to this year and looking forward, I would say that, I think, first and foremost, our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. And you all know that we have a reputation for generating strong cash flow and returning to gain cash flow to our shareholders, and that expectation has not changed. Thinking specifically about 2023, I would point out that CapEx is going to be down materially. So expectations for capital is about $1.5 billion. It is going to be a tale of 2 halves for this year with an expectation that the second half gets stronger. As we move here into the first quarter, it's my expectation that working capital should be flattish. But as I look towards the balance of the year, I actually hope to consume some working capital with better sales and better pricing. And then remember, our growth investments are starting to pay dividends as well, in particular, with the start-up of PO/TBA. And so again, as I think about the full year, it's my expectation, and I'm looking at Peter and he's nodding at me. But we will continue to return meaningful cash to shareholders, including growing our recurring dividend. Yes. Peter, first, I just want to say and express that I'm excited to have the opportunity to lead the Advanced bottomer solutions business through the transformation that we're embarking on. And I see a lot of potential in this business. And I put it in place a team that I think really can deliver. And the steps that we're taking, this Catalloy and [PB-1], or polybutenes or where that we're -- we really view [indiscernible] as a better fit in the O&P segment. This enables the new, what I call the new APS, to be very focused on our core value-creating model of compounding and customer solutions for brand owners and OEMs. We did well on the integration and cost reductions, but our APS business needs a much more customer-centric operating model. And this is going to be part of the journey that we are now embarking on it with the transformation. And our focused improvements in customer intimacy, technical support and service levels I think will really allow us to fix this business and grow it in a profitable way. And I'm looking forward to share more about this transformation journey at the Capital Markets Day coming up."

            "content": "Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $3 million. Margins remain pressured by feedstock and energy costs as well as the $25 million noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge. Volumes fell on lower seasonal demand exacerbated by high power prices that impacted our European customers' businesses. In the fourth quarter, we embarked on a journey to transform the APS segment. Our goal is to sharpen our focus on customer service and product development to maximize value for our customers and for LyondellBasell. With increased autonomy and accountability, we are developing a more agile operating model with meaningful media and segment growth strategies. As part of this transformation, the Catalloy and polybutene businesses will be moved from APS and reintegrated into the O&P segment beginning January 1, 2023. This move will allow the APS team to sharpen their focus on the compounding business, distinct from the Polymer business of Cattaloy and polybutene, which serves our O&P value chain. From a portfolio point of view, we estimate APS will shift approximately $200 million of annual EBITDA between O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments very equally. We plan to provide additional information regarding the impact of this change in March. I strongly believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential and I look forward to reporting on our team's progress in delivering on this transformation during our Capital Markets Day in March.  With that, I will return the call back to Peter."

Following today\u2019s presentation we will conduct the question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, Melissa. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documentation on our investor website provides reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release, in our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time today until November 28 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States; and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States.

Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Tim Foley, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Torkel Reman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with our safety results on Slide number 3. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety performance in 2022. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.12, roughly half the rate seen in recent years. Safety is a core value at our company and will continue to receive the utmost attention. The focus and commitment our metrics reflect will remain a cornerstone of our company's culture and a key enabler of our future success. Let's now turn to Slide number 4 to discuss our financial results. During the third quarter, as you would expect, our team remains very focused on cash generation while navigating the well-known, very challenging environment. LyondellBasell's business portfolio faced headwinds from rising costs and weaker demand at the same time. Earnings were $1.96 per share. EBITDA was $1.2 billion. Nonetheless, we delivered an impressive $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities. By the end of the quarter, we increased our balance of cash and short-term investments to $1.5 billion and had $5.3 billion of total available liquidity. The strength of our balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enables us to confidently move forward with our strategy while continuing to provide attractive and strong returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle. Despite significant headwinds our company generated a 19% return on invested capital over the past 12 months. On Slide number 5, we highlight some of LyondellBasell's existing and emerging sources of advantage for generating differential value and high returns over a range of market conditions. Our company is widely recognized for our deep commitment to safe operations, cost management and operational excellence. These values are part of our DNA. LyondellBasell's global portfolio of businesses benefit from both geographic and end market diversity, leading positions in the diverse markets, balance the portfolio and reduce risks from market concentration. Last quarter, I mentioned the work that is underway to identify a north star that provides clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. Some of the early decisions from this work adds to our capability and resiliency for generating value and high returns. Market leadership in circular and low-carbon solutions has quickly emerged as an essential parts of our path forward. We believe circular and low-carbon solutions will provide advantage under a wide range of economic scenarios. We will talk about this more in a few moments. An intense and consistent focus on people and culture is a key enabler for driving differential value. On October 1, we implemented a new organizational structure that will improve agility and accountability across our company. One example is our decision to align strategy and execution by moving the global responsibility for manufacturing under the strategic business unit leaders. The strategic business unit leaders will have the ability to run their businesses based upon the required value propositions and business models. We also launched customer and commercial excellence initiatives to elevate our levels of service, quality and innovation. With the right organizational structure and improved customer focus, our company will have even more capacity to capture differential value. After a very comprehensive diagnostic phase, a well-structured value enhancement program targeting $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvements have been launched. I will describe this program in more detail shortly. When these portfolio advantages are combined with our track record of efficient cash conversion, our investment-grade balance sheet and our secure steadily growing dividend, I think you will agree that LyondellBasell has the winning formula for generating high returns and differential value for our investors under a wide range of economic scenarios. On Slide number 6, I would like to share more detail on one of the decisions that quickly emerged from our strategy work, the creation of our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. In my view, circular and renewable solutions businesses require a differentiated business model and a more entrepreneurial mindset to succeed. We're setting up our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit with this in mind. This business unit is led by Yvonne van der Lann and is accountable for building scalable technologies and profitable businesses to serve rapidly growing customer demand for our circular and low-carbon solutions. Since we launched the Circulen brands in 2019, we've sold products with more than 150,000 tons of recycled and renewable content. Our current goal is to sell at least 2 million tons per year of these products by 2030, with our new business unit leading the way. For perspective, 2 million tons represents about 20% of our 2021 global sales of polyethylene and polypropylene. In just the past few weeks, we have announced our participation in several agreements related to new capacity for our circular and low-carbon solutions business in several regions. We are partnering on plastic waste sorting facilities in Houston and Germany. The sorting plants will convert longer plastic waste into usable feedstocks for mechanical and or advanced recycling. In Germany, we expect the facility will provide a material amount of the feedstock required for our first advanced recycling plants using LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec Technology. In India, we are forming a joint venture for a fully automated 50,000 tons per year mechanical recycling facility. And in China, we are developing another joint venture to mechanically recycle post-consumer waste in the Guangdong Province. I am confident that these and future actions will accelerate our circular and low-carbon solutions offering to position LyondellBasell as the preferred supplier for customers and brand owners seeking to lower the greenhouse gas impact of their business and increasing the circular content of their products. Our recently announced collaboration with Air Liquide, Chevron and Uniper on a U.S. Gulf Coast low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project is but one additional example of our progress. We're quickly and methodically building a robust supply chain to support attractive growth opportunities for our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Let's turn to Slide number 7 and discuss the launch of our value enhancement program. LyondellBasell has a well-earned reputation as a cost leader in our industry. But after 12 years with a singular focus on managing costs, a significant number of untapped value opportunities have accumulated. We believe this untapped value can be unlocked with modest incremental investments in resources. Our value enhancement program utilizes a proven stage gate methodology to identify, implement and track progress on hundreds of initiatives across the company. Over 2,000 IDs have been generated, and we have validated more than 1,500 initiatives to date. But we're just getting started. We organized value opportunities into three categories: manufacturing and operational excellence, procurement and supply chain and commercial excellence. We have confidence that our value enhancement program is capable of achieving an estimated $750 million of annual recurring EBITDA improvement by the end of 2025. And with the continuous evergreen process in place, we look forward to regularly extending our goals. We will keep you apprised of our progress and look forward to sharing more details on this program during our upcoming Capital Markets Day in March. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to describe the new organizational responsibilities for the business leaders on this call. Joining us on the call today is Kim Foley, who assumed responsibility for the Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining segments from Torkel Rhenman. Kim began her career with our company more than 30 years ago as a chemical engineer and has served in a broad range of leadership roles, spanning manufacturing, strategic planning, finance and supply chain. She is a proven leader with a deep knowledge of our company and value voice on our Executive Committee. Torkel Rhenman is now in charge of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In order to be a market leader, our APS business requires a customer service focus that is differential for most of LyondellBasell's other businesses. Torkel will develop the appropriate culture and service model to maximize the full value potential of our APS business. Torkel\u2019s prior experience as a CEO at other companies will serve us well in this role. Ken Lane will continue to have responsibility for our two olefins and polyolefins segments. And Jim Guilfoyle, who formally led APS is relocating to Rotterdam and reporting to Ken as the leader for the O&P business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of robust cash generation. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards a total of $7.6 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash on hand increased to $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the past four quarters, our team efficiently converted 100% of EBITDA into cash. This efficient and robust cash generation provided for the return of $4 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the third quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $400 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and an additional $160 million through share repurchases. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $440 million in capital expenditures, a significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction for our world-scale PO/TBA plant that remains on track for start-up in the first quarter 2023. My finance and strategy teams are partnering with our strategic business unit leaders to rigorously track the ongoing progress from our value enhancement program. We look forward to regular reporting on our value capture beginning in 2023. Now, I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflect margin compression across all segments due to rising costs and weaker global demand. Our olefins and polyolefins businesses faced persistently high and volatile energy cost, coupled with lower demand, particularly in Europe and China. While our oxyfuel business and refining segment continue to earn margins above historical averages and demand for fuels remained strong, results were sequentially lower following peak margins in the second quarter of 2022. Higher cost for energy, raw materials, labor and transportation negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across our European assets, September year-to-date energy costs are $1.8 billion higher than the same period in 2020. During the quarter, we recognized $84 million in cost related to the exit from our refining business. We expect to incur a similar amount for refining exit costs during each of the next five quarters. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Americas segment. Third quarter O&P Americas EBITDA decreased to $559 million. In North America, the combination of customer destocking and expectations of additional supply from new assets resulted in lower product prices. During the fourth quarter, we expect lower seasonal demand and further capacity additions will keep markets well supplied. Margin pressures could be offset by moderating feedstocks and energy costs. Also, with lower demand, we expect continued easing of logistical constraints. LyondellBasell will continue to reduce operating rates to match lower demand and manage our inventories. We expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at a rate of approximately 75% in the fourth quarter. While market conditions remain challenging, we continue to proactively advance our long-term strategy. We recently announced a new partnership with Cyclyx and ExxonMobil to build a 150,000-ton plastic waste sorting facility in Houston. Beyond recycling, we announced our participation in an industry consortium to evaluate a low-carbon hydrogen production facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast. We are moving quickly and decisively to increase circularity and reduce our carbon footprint. Now please turn to Slide 12 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. European markets were severely pressured by tight gas supplies and higher energy costs that reduced demand from both plastic converters and downstream consumers. LyondellBasell's European volumes declined due to extended downtime at our ethylene cracker in France, and planned maintenance at our cracker in Germany. All of this combined to result in a third quarter EBITDA loss of $83 million. During the fourth quarter, we expect high and volatile energy costs will persist. In addition, slower seasonal demand is likely to add further pressure on European markets. Our O&P Europe businesses have responded to escalating energy prices by reflecting these costs and product pricing with energy surcharges. This year, we introduced variable formulas for these surcharges to account for energy volatility and ensure fairness in our pricing. Also, in response to lower demand and margins, we plan to operate our European assets at approximately 60% of capacity during the fourth quarter. As previously announced, we have postponed the restart of our integrated O&P site in France until early 2023. As in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies in support of our circular and low-carbon business. In October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India. These partnerships allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose facilities in each region, while addressing rapidly rising global demand for circular and renewable solutions. Finally, I want to express how excited I am about the opportunities with the value enhancement program that Peter mentioned. Across the board, we see ideas being generated to improve value capture in manufacturing, procurement and serving our customers more efficiently. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim.\nKim Foley: Thank you, Ken, and thank you, Peter, for your kind remarks at the beginning of the call. Please turn to Slide 13 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Following a record second quarter, EBITDA for the segment declined to the third quarter of $360 million. Styrene margins deteriorated to a loss as market supply improved following second quarter industry outages. Oxyfuel margins declined relative to the second quarter, but remained above historical averages. Propylene oxide margins continued to moderate on softer demand for durable goods. In the fourth quarter, lower benzene and ethylene raw material costs are expected to improve styrene margins and bring the styrene business closer to breakeven. As we expect, lower seasonal demand will lead to further margin compression across most of the remaining IND product lines. Despite the improving outlook for styrene, we have decided to idle production at our Dutch propylene oxide and styrene monomer joint venture during the months of November and December due to the high energy costs and weaker European demand. Overall, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 75% capacity during the fourth quarter. We remain on track to start up our new PO/TBA plant in Houston during the first quarter of 2023. Lastly, as we have completed the validation steps for the IND portion of the value enhancement program, and we look forward to the implementation plans to be done by year-end. Now let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the results of the refining segment. The third quarter EBITDA decreased to $190 million on moderating margins following an extraordinarily strong second quarter demand for refined products. In the third quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined to about $47 per barrel, but remains well above historical averages. Due to planned maintenance, we operated the refinery at 80% of capacity with an average crude rate of 215,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect continued strength in the Maya 2-1-1 spread driven by a tight market and strong demand. We plan to run the refinery above 90% capacity during the fourth quarter. The successful completion of the planned maintenance during the third quarter demonstrates our commitment to safely operate these assets with high reliability until we exit the refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you, Kim. I'm extremely excited to be joining the Advanced Polymer Solutions team. With integration now complete, I look forward to increasing our agility, speed and customer focus to maximize the value of this business. Now let's review the third quarter results on Slide 15. Third quarter EBITDA was $66 million. Margins in the Compounding & Solutions business and the Advanced Polymers business were both pressured by higher feedstock and energy costs. Volumes for our catalloy roofing polymers decreased due to unplanned downtime at one of our major customers. We expect similar results from this segment during the fourth quarter with a small volume improvement from increased automotive production. In my initial meetings with our APS customers have witnessed the considerable and growing demand for circular and low-carbon solutions. The APS business provides a natural extension of the value chain for LyondellBasell's sustainable solutions, and our team is actively addressing these opportunities. As Peter mentioned, we believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential. While our team will have some autonomy to instil a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you again to the entire LyondellBasell team for successfully navigating this challenging quarter. To close out our segments, let's turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA declined by $20 million to $92 million due to lower catalyst demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect our licensing revenue will moderate and catalyst volumes will decrease due to lower demand on a weaker macroeconomic outlook. We estimate that fourth quarter results for the Technology segment will be roughly half of quarterly results seen thus far in 2022. After the slow beginning to 2022, our licensing business signed six new agreements during the third quarter to provide polyolefin process technologies for five projects in Asia and one in Europe. Over the history of our company, LyondellBasell has sold more than 300 polyolefin licenses around the world, and we continue to be a leader in this space. As indicated by our activity to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany, we are making good progress on developing our MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And during my recent visit to our technology center in Italy, I was impressed by the rich legacy of innovation at LyondellBasell and the creative work underway to launch this exciting technology. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an initial investment decision for a commercial scale plant in the fourth quarter. Now let me summarize our third quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide 17. Despite very challenging markets, our team is delivering results. Our goal is to capture value and move forward on strategic priorities under a variety of economic conditions. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. The outstanding safety performance from our team is just one indicator of the passion and commitment that I see across our workforce. Our O&P businesses are under pressure from weaker demand, new supply and higher energy costs. With our diverse business portfolio often provides balance. In the third quarter, our oxyfuels and refining businesses provided offsets with margins that remained well above historical averages. With over $550 million in dividends and share repurchases during the third quarter, our commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. LyondellBasell is focused on serving growing customer demand for our Circulen products. We recognize the differential needs of these businesses and are rapidly moving to enter multiple partnerships to secure the plastic waste feedstocks required to advance the leading position of our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally weaker demand and volatile energy costs will further pressure fourth quarter margins. In response, we are proactively lowering operating rates to match reduced demand. Our business leaders are optimizing working capital and further strengthening our balance sheet flexibility. We'll remain watchful for market improvements in China as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during 2023. I hope that you can sense our excitement around the initial progress towards developing a north star to guide LyondellBasell's strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we launched the new organizational structure and established a circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. We are building the structures and leadership that will enable LyondellBasell to quickly advance and our initial strategies with new business models that address our customers' needs. We're also highly energized around the prospects of unlocking the opportunities identified by our value enhancement program. We have put into place the required infrastructure and management expertise to organize, support and track our progress. We aim to leverage LyondellBasell's core competencies and target value opportunities totaling $750 million in annual recurring EBITDA by the end of 2025. In closing, we look forward to sharing more details over the coming months and at our Capital Markets Day in New York next March that should clarify your understanding of LyondellBasell's forward strategy. We're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: I think I'd like to dig in first with your PO/TBA plant that you're talking about starting up in the first quarter, how would you assess the supply and demand fundamentals of PO/TBA right now, given you got some idle capacity, are you potentially considering a delay on that start. And maybe longer term, do you have a view on how that the competitive landscape in PO/TBA is going to be given your competitor probably is pretty high on the cost curve with the cost of chlorine these days, do you see potentially some rationing of capacity down the road? .\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Steve. Good question, Peter here. No delay in the startup on the PO/TBA plant. As we have alluded to with the Q2 results, fall, we are, I mean, quite favorable in our costs on the PO/TBA side. This is a world-scale plants, very well integrated. So we believe that independent of what is happening in the marketplace, we are very well positioned to start up that plant, and therefore, no changes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nP.J. Juvekar: Just a couple of related questions on your Circulen economy. When you look at Circulen, what kind of return on capital are you targeting? And can you talk a little bit about your contracting structure that will ensure your return on capital. And then secondly, on decarbonization, you have this joint venture with Air Liquide, Chevron and Uniper. I guess with the passing of the IRA and the new 45Q credit. How do you think about the hard to abet sectors like ethylene? And any update on your cracker electrification related to that?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, P.J. Very good questions, as usual. On the Circulen economy, we are at the very early stage in this year. But just coming back, I mean, from the Kfar and Dusseldorf. You know this is organized every two years that was an amazing positiveness around renewable and circular solutions, both, I mean, from the brand owner side as well as from the companies that were actually producing the packaging. So we noticed that there was quite some demand, I mean, to accelerate the amount of volumes that are being brought into the marketplace. And as a consequence, of course, willingness to pay, that is there across the value chain. So that gives us the commitments that we are, as you have seen during the last couple of weeks with the creation of that strategic business unit that we are accelerating because we see this as a value proposition, which is quite attractive. Then on the second question on the IRA, I will give that question to you, Ken.\nKen Lane: Yes, sure. P.J. Thank you for the question. what we've commented before has not changed in terms of our targets looking out to 2030, we're making very good progress on reaching that 30% reduction that we put out there. When you start talking about some of the other options around CO2 reduction like electrification or carbon sequestration certainly, things like the tax benefits that you see coming out of the IRA for CO2 sequestration is going to help. But we're going to look at all of those options in our portfolio. And as you can imagine, every site is a little bit different. It depends on the location of the site and what infrastructure is available around it. And we're going to keep exploring those in the coming months, and we'll be able to share more about that later. But right now, it's really more in the exploratory phase and assessing what the potential is for these technologies today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: I guess I just wanted to get your perspective on how the next couple of years could shake out. I know it's still early, but you have provided some discrete items here, including the $750 million by 2025. So if you consider that Q3 EBITDA around $1.1 billion, maybe there's some uplift as you go through seasonality into Q2 and Q3 of next year. And then you layer in the PO/TBA gains as well as extra EBITDA from Hyperzone and some of your other projects. What would you say is kind of the new prof level of EBITDA? Would we be mistaken if we were to annualize that 1, 2 to 5 and then maybe move up into the $6 billion range, just given some of your investments at a trough level. Is that a fair assumption?\nPeter Vanacker: Let me take that question. Peter here speaking. As you alluded to, mid-cycle earnings, what we talked about in the past was increasing from $6.5 billion to $8 billion. And you mentioned a couple of these elements that bridge that $1.5 billion, one being the Zelman acquisition, then our joint venture that we have in China, the joint venture with Sasol and Louisiana, the Hyperzone investments or POSM joint venture as well as the PO/TBA. So you may know that on top of that, our commitment to increase value on the bottom line by EUR 750 million on a run rate by the end of 2025. So that means that if you look at the year 2026, we expect, I mean, to capture that fully that $750 million. And of course, we are still in progress of developing our North Star strategy. So more on that to come then with the Capital Markets Day in March, I mean, next year, and if we find other opportunities to create value. In case that question comes up, by experience by launching these value enhancement projects in the first year, one may expect that about what -- 20% of that can be captured on a run rate basis by the end in that first year. So this is not something that is completely back ended towards 2025 that due to the fact that we already have the teams in place, we have a transformation office in place the value capturing, the sequencing of the different topics starting immediately.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Spector: Just on your European assets within O&P. So I mean you're taking actions today and you continue to take more to address some of the lower profitability. I guess if we think about this energy environment persisting for next year plus, are there other actions that you would take to optimize your asset base further? And I guess where are you kind of in the line of thinking along making changes, further changes to the region?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, thank you for your question. And it's needless to say that, of course, our crisis management team has been up and running already since quite some months even before I joined the company. So we continue to monitor very intensively what is happening in the marketplace. We alluded to I mean on the call to the actions that we had undertaken. So the Berre cracker in France will not start up prior to the end of this year. But needless to say that we are monitoring that situation in the marketplace every week to then define what the right time will be to start at the cracker. In addition to that, we currently have a scheduled shutdown ongoing in the smallest of the steam crackers in Germany, so-called OM4 steam cracker. We expect that to start up on time. And there we would not take any action to delay that startup. And then what Kim alluded to is that the joint venture asset that we have in Rotterdam, that has been idled for the time being. And then, of course, also there, we will evaluate how the market is developing, especially on the styrene monomer site because we hear, of course, also in the markets that on-purpose styrene monomer production have been idled or multiple or even question, that will they be profitable and be started up again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: I think I have a question for Ken Lane. China is being -- China purchases oil at a discount to the Brent price from Russia. Does that purchasing, that discounted purchasing provide a cushion to Chinese petrochemical margins? Or does it not influence Chinese petrochemical margin? And can you sort of characterize the state of the Chinese polyethylene market these days. .\nKen Lane: Sure, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So we've done a lot of investigation into that, as you can imagine, because what we're seeing in the China market, we're at historically low spreads there and a lot of that is driven by the new capacity coming on. But our view is a lot of that oil is actually going into the state-owned refiners and not being passed on to the market in terms of lower priced feedstocks for the polymers. What's happening in China is really more related just to the higher capacity and the lower demand that we're seeing there. So that is going to be the larger driver in the even midterm -- what we really want to see is the growth come back in the China market, which we've not seen as of yet, and you may recall, going back to even the first quarter earnings call, we were talking about expecting to see some recovery in demand in China already after Chinese New Year, and that just has not materialized. So once we see that and that demand starts to absorb all of the new capacity, then I think you're going to start to see a return to a more normal level of spreads in China.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAleksey Yefremov: We saw energy prices in Europe have come down quite a bit in recent weeks. Could you attempt to sort of provide mark-to-market, how much better your profits would be in EMEA and perhaps in IND if these energy prices kind of stay the same and all other factors were like in place as well.\nPeter Vanacker: Do you want to make comments first, you can, what\u2019s your views on this.\nMichael McMurray: My view is that we're seeing some moderating in the headwinds around the energy costs and feedstock costs in Europe, and that could be short-lived. If we have a cold winter, then we might see that reverse. But longer term, obviously, one of the things that we're going to be looking at are ways to improve the competitiveness of our assets. What can we do to make the flexibility of our feed slate and the energy consumption that we have in those assets more competitive. And frankly, some of that is going to be related to our CO2 reduction targets because believe it or not, that is a way that we will improve competitiveness is by finding lower CO2 energy by making the assets more efficient and improving our cost position. So a lot of things are going to happen over time here. And we're currently very focused on what's happening in the short term, but don't let that make you think that we're not thinking longer term about how we position ourselves more competitively in the region.\nPeter Vanacker: And all that to be put in perspective, of course, I mean, year-to-date, European energy costs for us were $1.8 billion higher compared to 2020 in the same period.\nMichael McMurray: And Peter, you want to maybe make some comments from an enterprise perspective to help the analysts and investors kind of think sequentially as well. I mean, things lagged down substantially in August versus July. It was pretty dramatic. And those reasons were highlighted in our release today and then September deteriorated further. And as we look forward to October, it should be a bit better than September. And as you pointed out, we are seeing some relief in both feedstocks and energy costs. And I would say, broadly, it feels like we're kind of finding maybe a bottom. But to be clear, Q4 will be sequentially lower than Q3. We're facing into persistent inflation, high-cost energy, weaker seasonal demand and we're missing fixed cost absorption with all the idled and curtailed assets, which are heavier curtailed in Q4. So again -- and we're also experiencing the full effect of lower prices from the third quarter. So again, dramatic drop-off from July to August. So we will be sequentially down.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Could you speak a little bit more in more detail about the program to get it to $750 million and maybe an area I would appreciate some focus on -- what are the things that you're doing that are taking until 2025 to see the EBITDA show up in your results? And if you could also comment on what, if any, cash costs are associated with going after the $750 million?\nPeter Vanacker: Thanks, Vincent. very good question. Let me do one step back. I mean we have set this transformation office and organized a large number of bottom-up workshops across the different functions, so the commercial functions, supply chain functions, procurement functions, but also very important in our U.S. largest manufacturing sites. And out of that came this around 2,000 IDs early stage in projects. So we have not yet covered the European region, and we have not yet covered the smaller sites. But we see already that we get lots of IDs on how to create value. And a lot of these IDs do not materially demand higher OpEx or higher CapEx. So these are the ones that, of course, we will focus upon. And there can be, of course, it's a very broad range. So it is about energy management. It is about creep capacities clear if we don't need a creep capacity because of the market situation, these will not be the projects that we will do first. They will then come later. But it's a very, very broad range, I mean, of projects that we have here in terms of covering the entire portfolio. So we'll provide more details on that when we talk on the Capital Markets Day because we will have progressed more as well. As I said, we are now in the phase of prioritization. So what out of those 2,000 IDs do we actually want to implement to make sense in the current market environment. So then we go, I mean, to the so-called stage number 4 and then make the people available, I mean, to capture those opportunities. Next year, we will start doing the analysis also in the European sites. So we will start with the larger sites and then also move to the smaller sites. So that should normally also has in the confidence that we can at least capture $750 million by the end of 2025 on a run rate basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Peter and Ken, can you discuss the outlook for the U.S. polyethylene market in the context of the new capacity coming on from both Shell and Bay part over the next few months here?\nPeter Vanacker: Ken?\nKen Lane: Some of that market. They've been doing some premarketing for quite a while now. So Obviously, going back to what I had said earlier, just around China, what's going to be very meaningful is overall for the market supply demand is going to be the return to growth in the market. And these assets, like any are going to get absorbed. I'm sure they're very competitive assets based on the feedstock situation in the U.S. So -- there will be a period of time now where we're going to have to weather that and absorb that in exited Q3 is where I expect us to be in Q4. So things like Michael had referred to earlier, things really dropped off in the middle of Q3, and we've kind of levelled off in that range. So what we're doing now is taking actions that we can control to improve our cash flow and be able to meet demand without being cash suboptimal here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Most folks are looking for some degree of a recession next year. So I'm just curious when you think about the third quarter and the fourth quarter, and you annualize that, why wouldn't that be sort of the trough potential for Lyondell heading into '23? And then what needs to happen for the first half of '23 to be better than the second half of '22?\nPeter Vanacker: That's a very good question, of course, and we've alluded to that and Ken made comments as well in this call. Very important just to look at China. What will happen in China, how will demand be encouraged in China? That's a big question mark. I mean you know that China normally imported about 40% of their needs in polyethylene. So at this point in time, not a lot of growth in China, and therefore, the material is not flowing into China either. So that's an important element to look at. And of course, I mean, what about the cost situation. We've alluded to that also in the call already energy costs on the other hand side, electricity costs, of course, included in that. And Ken, anything you want to add?\nKen Lane: I think you've hit it. Again, it's going to be getting more growth back in the market and seeing some of the headwinds around feedstocks and energy come off, which right now is hard to predict.\nPeter Vanacker: What we have seen also in the past, if you just look at the history, then markets have relatively quickly recovered as well. That doesn't mean that I'm not saying that we have seen the trough going back to Michael's comments before. But how long can I stay like this is the question that we are all looking at.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: I was wondering if you could speak to your inventory levels internally as well as your perception of inventory downstream among your customers reason I ask is you've put forth some very low operating rates for the fourth quarter. If I look at the inventory on your balance sheet, it's up, but it's not up dramatically, maybe 3% or 4% year-over-year. And so just looking for some context, do you think these low operating rates will serve to rightsize inventory by year-end? Or might it take longer than that? How would you frame that issue?\nPeter Vanacker: Thanks for your question, Kevin. Maybe I'll start by saying that our teams have done an excellent work in focusing on cash management and you see that from the results. So -- and that, of course, includes on one hand side, payables and receivables, but also we have dealt, I mean, with our own inventory levels, as you recognized as well. Now when we look at the downstream and it depends, of course, a little bit from market to market. But normally, in the ID business, we don't have a lot of inventory in the pipeline in the channel. And can allow me to say that what we have seen is that the inventory levels also in the polyolefin side, they have reduced during the third quarter.\nKen Lane: Yes, that's right. I mean, we certainly -- we've adjusted and what you've seen even with the adjustment to the utilization rates that we've communicated is we're adjusting the utilization rate to match what we see with our demand and we'll continue to do that in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Leithead: Just two around capital uses and returns. First, I wanted to reask part of Vincent's question and just see if you could give us at least a rough cash spend figure for the $750 million EBITDA value-enhanced program? And second, just on circular and low-carbon solutions. I assume this is going to be a focus area in March. But could you just give us a rough sense of the capital you tend to spend annually on this area? And just any sort of commensurate type EBITDA or return on capital or return hurdles we should expect there?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you for your question, Mike. I mean, of course, clearly, as we have pointed out in the past, our capital allocation strategy has not changed. You remember that I said also looking at our CapEx investments, around EUR 2 billion, $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion in sustaining CapEx and the rest of mining growth CapEx. Well, if you look now at 2023, we are, of course, reflecting upon what is happening in the marketplace. So you may not expect -- I mean, to see that number of $2 billion. It will be quite lower. So therefore, you will not really see an uptick because of our value enhancement program in terms of CapEx, if you look at it in the overall CapEx that we have invested in our business because as said, I mean, the number for next year will be lower. And then of course, as you roll out these programs, like the value enhancement program, they don't have a beginning and an end. They become part of the DNA in the company. as continuous improvement. So at the beginning, of course, in the first years, there will be more low-hanging fruit, how we operate not heavily in OpEx and CapEx, so you won't see it, so to say, in the overall numbers. And then when we start talking about 26, 27, then probably, I mean, you talk about debottlenecking activities and so on. But then every project on its own will have to have its own merits and we will reflect on every project on the IRR. So it will be, of course, as said, it must be a value enhancement project that we have that is not dilutive for the company in terms of our IRR or return on capital. And the return profile of these projects is generally very high.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Matt [indiscernible] on for John. Specifically in O&P-EAI, you noted your plan to run the crackers in Europe slightly lower quarter-over-quarter. But are there any other expenses to consider either that you incurred in 3Q or will incur in 4Q when we're trying to bridge the quarter-over-quarter profitability in the segment?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. You know that we have always been extremely focused on costs. So cost discipline, even when I joined LyondellBasell, I was quite amazed. I mean how deep it is embedded in the DNA. So yes, we have not announced a certain number in terms of cost preservation, cost reduction but remain sure that, I mean, this continues to be managed on a daily basis, so where we can actually reduce our costs, but not at the expense of our value enhancement program. Michael?\nMichael McMurray: Yes. Maybe I'll reinforce a couple of things. So I mean, no doubt, the current environment has implications for our spending plans, both this year and next year. And then as you would expect, we are taking appropriate actions in particular in Europe. And as Peter said, our value enhancement program will also help. So it's incremental, but interestingly, it's also sustainable. . And then we have a great team, and we've demonstrated our ability to navigate difficult environments like in 2020, where we covered our full dividend and capital program with cash from operations. We already operate lean which gives us an advantage versus others. And as Peter also said, that said, our view on safety and reliability is steadfast. We don't want to destroy long-term value put our assets in parallel. So again, we're confident in our ability to manage and actually come out stronger on the other side.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch for Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question.\nFrank Mitsch: I wanted to offer my congratulations to Kim. I believe we met Kim a few years ago in a channel view site tour. And as part of IND, you indicated that you're going to run in the fourth quarter at 75% operating rate. I was wondering what that was in the third quarter. I don't believe I saw that. And then also that 75% operating rate in the fourth quarter, there are a few different segments within IND. Is there any area that is going to be particularly higher or lower than that 75% average?\nKim Foley: Thank you, Frank. And yes, I remember our visit through the Cataby facility quite well. I hope to see you again as we start up the new PO/TBA plant later next year or early next year, I should say. As it relates to your question, the operating rates in the third quarter were about 75%. So we're basically steady or equivalent quarter-on-quarter. Some of the differences as far as what we're operating is around my comments that I made earlier in the presentation. So we'll be idling the P11 or the propylene oxide styrene monomer plant in Maasvlakte and the way that we -- what we will do with that is we'll have the opportunity to help improve the styrene supply demand as well as run our PO/TBA plants at higher capacity.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have come to the end of our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments.\nPeter Vanacker: Okay. Thank you, everybody, and thank you for joining also all your as usual, very thoughtful questions. We look forward to sharing more of our plans and how LyondellBasell will advance on our strategy and unlock additional value over the coming months. I wish you all a great weekend. Stay safe and looking forward to meeting you again soon.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with our safety results on Slide number 3. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety performance in 2022. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.12, roughly half the rate seen in recent years. Safety is a core value at our company and will continue to receive the utmost attention. The focus and commitment our metrics reflect will remain a cornerstone of our company's culture and a key enabler of our future success. Let's now turn to Slide number 4 to discuss our financial results. During the third quarter, as you would expect, our team remains very focused on cash generation while navigating the well-known, very challenging environment. LyondellBasell's business portfolio faced headwinds from rising costs and weaker demand at the same time. Earnings were $1.96 per share. EBITDA was $1.2 billion. Nonetheless, we delivered an impressive $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities. By the end of the quarter, we increased our balance of cash and short-term investments to $1.5 billion and had $5.3 billion of total available liquidity. The strength of our balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enables us to confidently move forward with our strategy while continuing to provide attractive and strong returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle. Despite significant headwinds our company generated a 19% return on invested capital over the past 12 months. On Slide number 5, we highlight some of LyondellBasell's existing and emerging sources of advantage for generating differential value and high returns over a range of market conditions. Our company is widely recognized for our deep commitment to safe operations, cost management and operational excellence. These values are part of our DNA. LyondellBasell's global portfolio of businesses benefit from both geographic and end market diversity, leading positions in the diverse markets, balance the portfolio and reduce risks from market concentration. Last quarter, I mentioned the work that is underway to identify a north star that provides clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. Some of the early decisions from this work adds to our capability and resiliency for generating value and high returns. Market leadership in circular and low-carbon solutions has quickly emerged as an essential parts of our path forward. We believe circular and low-carbon solutions will provide advantage under a wide range of economic scenarios. We will talk about this more in a few moments. An intense and consistent focus on people and culture is a key enabler for driving differential value. On October 1, we implemented a new organizational structure that will improve agility and accountability across our company. One example is our decision to align strategy and execution by moving the global responsibility for manufacturing under the strategic business unit leaders. The strategic business unit leaders will have the ability to run their businesses based upon the required value propositions and business models. We also launched customer and commercial excellence initiatives to elevate our levels of service, quality and innovation. With the right organizational structure and improved customer focus, our company will have even more capacity to capture differential value. After a very comprehensive diagnostic phase, a well-structured value enhancement program targeting $750 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvements have been launched. I will describe this program in more detail shortly. When these portfolio advantages are combined with our track record of efficient cash conversion, our investment-grade balance sheet and our secure steadily growing dividend, I think you will agree that LyondellBasell has the winning formula for generating high returns and differential value for our investors under a wide range of economic scenarios. On Slide number 6, I would like to share more detail on one of the decisions that quickly emerged from our strategy work, the creation of our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. In my view, circular and renewable solutions businesses require a differentiated business model and a more entrepreneurial mindset to succeed. We're setting up our new circular and low-carbon solutions business unit with this in mind. This business unit is led by Yvonne van der Lann and is accountable for building scalable technologies and profitable businesses to serve rapidly growing customer demand for our circular and low-carbon solutions. Since we launched the Circulen brands in 2019, we've sold products with more than 150,000 tons of recycled and renewable content. Our current goal is to sell at least 2 million tons per year of these products by 2030, with our new business unit leading the way. For perspective, 2 million tons represents about 20% of our 2021 global sales of polyethylene and polypropylene. In just the past few weeks, we have announced our participation in several agreements related to new capacity for our circular and low-carbon solutions business in several regions. We are partnering on plastic waste sorting facilities in Houston and Germany. The sorting plants will convert longer plastic waste into usable feedstocks for mechanical and or advanced recycling. In Germany, we expect the facility will provide a material amount of the feedstock required for our first advanced recycling plants using LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec Technology. In India, we are forming a joint venture for a fully automated 50,000 tons per year mechanical recycling facility. And in China, we are developing another joint venture to mechanically recycle post-consumer waste in the Guangdong Province. I am confident that these and future actions will accelerate our circular and low-carbon solutions offering to position LyondellBasell as the preferred supplier for customers and brand owners seeking to lower the greenhouse gas impact of their business and increasing the circular content of their products. Our recently announced collaboration with Air Liquide, Chevron and Uniper on a U.S. Gulf Coast low-carbon hydrogen and ammonia project is but one additional example of our progress. We're quickly and methodically building a robust supply chain to support attractive growth opportunities for our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Let's turn to Slide number 7 and discuss the launch of our value enhancement program. LyondellBasell has a well-earned reputation as a cost leader in our industry. But after 12 years with a singular focus on managing costs, a significant number of untapped value opportunities have accumulated. We believe this untapped value can be unlocked with modest incremental investments in resources. Our value enhancement program utilizes a proven stage gate methodology to identify, implement and track progress on hundreds of initiatives across the company. Over 2,000 IDs have been generated, and we have validated more than 1,500 initiatives to date. But we're just getting started. We organized value opportunities into three categories: manufacturing and operational excellence, procurement and supply chain and commercial excellence. We have confidence that our value enhancement program is capable of achieving an estimated $750 million of annual recurring EBITDA improvement by the end of 2025. And with the continuous evergreen process in place, we look forward to regularly extending our goals. We will keep you apprised of our progress and look forward to sharing more details on this program during our upcoming Capital Markets Day in March. Before I turn the call over to Michael, I would like to describe the new organizational responsibilities for the business leaders on this call. Joining us on the call today is Kim Foley, who assumed responsibility for the Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining segments from Torkel Rhenman. Kim began her career with our company more than 30 years ago as a chemical engineer and has served in a broad range of leadership roles, spanning manufacturing, strategic planning, finance and supply chain. She is a proven leader with a deep knowledge of our company and value voice on our Executive Committee. Torkel Rhenman is now in charge of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In order to be a market leader, our APS business requires a customer service focus that is differential for most of LyondellBasell's other businesses. Torkel will develop the appropriate culture and service model to maximize the full value potential of our APS business. Torkel's prior experience as a CEO at other companies will serve us well in this role. Ken Lane will continue to have responsibility for our two olefins and polyolefins segments. And Jim Guilfoyle, who formally led APS is relocating to Rotterdam and reporting to Ken as the leader for the O&P business in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and India. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you again to the entire LyondellBasell team for successfully navigating this challenging quarter. To close out our segments, let's turn to Slide 16 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA declined by $20 million to $92 million due to lower catalyst demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect our licensing revenue will moderate and catalyst volumes will decrease due to lower demand on a weaker macroeconomic outlook. We estimate that fourth quarter results for the Technology segment will be roughly half of quarterly results seen thus far in 2022. After the slow beginning to 2022, our licensing business signed six new agreements during the third quarter to provide polyolefin process technologies for five projects in Asia and one in Europe. Over the history of our company, LyondellBasell has sold more than 300 polyolefin licenses around the world, and we continue to be a leader in this space. As indicated by our activity to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany, we are making good progress on developing our MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And during my recent visit to our technology center in Italy, I was impressed by the rich legacy of innovation at LyondellBasell and the creative work underway to launch this exciting technology. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an initial investment decision for a commercial scale plant in the fourth quarter. Now let me summarize our third quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide 17. Despite very challenging markets, our team is delivering results. Our goal is to capture value and move forward on strategic priorities under a variety of economic conditions. We remain focused on LyondellBasell's core values. The outstanding safety performance from our team is just one indicator of the passion and commitment that I see across our workforce. Our O&P businesses are under pressure from weaker demand, new supply and higher energy costs. With our diverse business portfolio often provides balance. In the third quarter, our oxyfuels and refining businesses provided offsets with margins that remained well above historical averages. With over $550 million in dividends and share repurchases during the third quarter, our commitment to shareholder returns remains strong. LyondellBasell is focused on serving growing customer demand for our Circulen products. We recognize the differential needs of these businesses and are rapidly moving to enter multiple partnerships to secure the plastic waste feedstocks required to advance the leading position of our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally weaker demand and volatile energy costs will further pressure fourth quarter margins. In response, we are proactively lowering operating rates to match reduced demand. Our business leaders are optimizing working capital and further strengthening our balance sheet flexibility. We'll remain watchful for market improvements in China as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during 2023. I hope that you can sense our excitement around the initial progress towards developing a north star to guide LyondellBasell's strategic initiatives. During the quarter, we launched the new organizational structure and established a circular and low-carbon solutions business unit. We are building the structures and leadership that will enable LyondellBasell to quickly advance and our initial strategies with new business models that address our customers' needs. We're also highly energized around the prospects of unlocking the opportunities identified by our value enhancement program. We have put into place the required infrastructure and management expertise to organize, support and track our progress. We aim to leverage LyondellBasell's core competencies and target value opportunities totaling $750 million in annual recurring EBITDA by the end of 2025. In closing, we look forward to sharing more details over the coming months and at our Capital Markets Day in New York next March that should clarify your understanding of LyondellBasell's forward strategy. We're now pleased to take your questions. Thank you, Steve. Good question, Peter here. No delay in the startup on the PO/TBA plant. As we have alluded to with the Q2 results, fall, we are, I mean, quite favorable in our costs on the PO/TBA side. This is a world-scale plants, very well integrated. So we believe that independent of what is happening in the marketplace, we are very well positioned to start up that plant, and therefore, no changes. Thank you, P.J. Very good questions, as usual. On the Circulen economy, we are at the very early stage in this year. But just coming back, I mean, from the Kfar and Dusseldorf. You know this is organized every two years that was an amazing positiveness around renewable and circular solutions, both, I mean, from the brand owner side as well as from the companies that were actually producing the packaging. So we noticed that there was quite some demand, I mean, to accelerate the amount of volumes that are being brought into the marketplace. And as a consequence, of course, willingness to pay, that is there across the value chain. So that gives us the commitments that we are, as you have seen during the last couple of weeks with the creation of that strategic business unit that we are accelerating because we see this as a value proposition, which is quite attractive. Then on the second question on the IRA, I will give that question to you, Ken. Let me take that question. Peter here speaking. As you alluded to, mid-cycle earnings, what we talked about in the past was increasing from $6.5 billion to $8 billion. And you mentioned a couple of these elements that bridge that $1.5 billion, one being the Zelman acquisition, then our joint venture that we have in China, the joint venture with Sasol and Louisiana, the Hyperzone investments or POSM joint venture as well as the PO/TBA. So you may know that on top of that, our commitment to increase value on the bottom line by EUR 750 million on a run rate by the end of 2025. So that means that if you look at the year 2026, we expect, I mean, to capture that fully that $750 million. And of course, we are still in progress of developing our North Star strategy. So more on that to come then with the Capital Markets Day in March, I mean, next year, and if we find other opportunities to create value. In case that question comes up, by experience by launching these value enhancement projects in the first year, one may expect that about what -- 20% of that can be captured on a run rate basis by the end in that first year. So this is not something that is completely back ended towards 2025 that due to the fact that we already have the teams in place, we have a transformation office in place the value capturing, the sequencing of the different topics starting immediately. Well, thank you for your question. And it's needless to say that, of course, our crisis management team has been up and running already since quite some months even before I joined the company. So we continue to monitor very intensively what is happening in the marketplace. We alluded to I mean on the call to the actions that we had undertaken. So the Berre cracker in France will not start up prior to the end of this year. But needless to say that we are monitoring that situation in the marketplace every week to then define what the right time will be to start at the cracker. In addition to that, we currently have a scheduled shutdown ongoing in the smallest of the steam crackers in Germany, so-called OM4 steam cracker. We expect that to start up on time. And there we would not take any action to delay that startup. And then what Kim alluded to is that the joint venture asset that we have in Rotterdam, that has been idled for the time being. And then, of course, also there, we will evaluate how the market is developing, especially on the styrene monomer site because we hear, of course, also in the markets that on-purpose styrene monomer production have been idled or multiple or even question, that will they be profitable and be started up again. Do you want to make comments first, you can, what's your views on this. And all that to be put in perspective, of course, I mean, year-to-date, European energy costs for us were $1.8 billion higher compared to 2020 in the same period. Thanks, Vincent. very good question. Let me do one step back. I mean we have set this transformation office and organized a large number of bottom-up workshops across the different functions, so the commercial functions, supply chain functions, procurement functions, but also very important in our U.S. largest manufacturing sites. And out of that came this around 2,000 IDs early stage in projects. So we have not yet covered the European region, and we have not yet covered the smaller sites. But we see already that we get lots of IDs on how to create value. And a lot of these IDs do not materially demand higher OpEx or higher CapEx. So these are the ones that, of course, we will focus upon. And there can be, of course, it's a very broad range. So it is about energy management. It is about creep capacities clear if we don't need a creep capacity because of the market situation, these will not be the projects that we will do first. They will then come later. But it's a very, very broad range, I mean, of projects that we have here in terms of covering the entire portfolio. So we'll provide more details on that when we talk on the Capital Markets Day because we will have progressed more as well. As I said, we are now in the phase of prioritization. So what out of those 2,000 IDs do we actually want to implement to make sense in the current market environment. So then we go, I mean, to the so-called stage number 4 and then make the people available, I mean, to capture those opportunities. Next year, we will start doing the analysis also in the European sites. So we will start with the larger sites and then also move to the smaller sites. So that should normally also has in the confidence that we can at least capture $750 million by the end of 2025 on a run rate basis. Ken? That's a very good question, of course, and we've alluded to that and Ken made comments as well in this call. Very important just to look at China. What will happen in China, how will demand be encouraged in China? That's a big question mark. I mean you know that China normally imported about 40% of their needs in polyethylene. So at this point in time, not a lot of growth in China, and therefore, the material is not flowing into China either. So that's an important element to look at. And of course, I mean, what about the cost situation. We've alluded to that also in the call already energy costs on the other hand side, electricity costs, of course, included in that. And Ken, anything you want to add? What we have seen also in the past, if you just look at the history, then markets have relatively quickly recovered as well. That doesn't mean that I'm not saying that we have seen the trough going back to Michael's comments before. But how long can I stay like this is the question that we are all looking at. Thanks for your question, Kevin. Maybe I'll start by saying that our teams have done an excellent work in focusing on cash management and you see that from the results. So -- and that, of course, includes on one hand side, payables and receivables, but also we have dealt, I mean, with our own inventory levels, as you recognized as well. Now when we look at the downstream and it depends, of course, a little bit from market to market. But normally, in the ID business, we don't have a lot of inventory in the pipeline in the channel. And can allow me to say that what we have seen is that the inventory levels also in the polyolefin side, they have reduced during the third quarter. Yes. Thank you for your question, Mike. I mean, of course, clearly, as we have pointed out in the past, our capital allocation strategy has not changed. You remember that I said also looking at our CapEx investments, around EUR 2 billion, $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion in sustaining CapEx and the rest of mining growth CapEx. Well, if you look now at 2023, we are, of course, reflecting upon what is happening in the marketplace. So you may not expect -- I mean, to see that number of $2 billion. It will be quite lower. So therefore, you will not really see an uptick because of our value enhancement program in terms of CapEx, if you look at it in the overall CapEx that we have invested in our business because as said, I mean, the number for next year will be lower. And then of course, as you roll out these programs, like the value enhancement program, they don't have a beginning and an end. They become part of the DNA in the company. as continuous improvement. So at the beginning, of course, in the first years, there will be more low-hanging fruit, how we operate not heavily in OpEx and CapEx, so you won't see it, so to say, in the overall numbers. And then when we start talking about 26, 27, then probably, I mean, you talk about debottlenecking activities and so on. But then every project on its own will have to have its own merits and we will reflect on every project on the IRR.

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of robust cash generation. In the third quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.4 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards a total of $7.6 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash on hand increased to $1.5 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the past four quarters, our team efficiently converted 100% of EBITDA into cash. This efficient and robust cash generation provided for the return of $4 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the third quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter, we returned $400 million to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend and an additional $160 million through share repurchases. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with $440 million in capital expenditures, a significant portion of this capital funded the final stages of construction for our world-scale PO/TBA plant that remains on track for start-up in the first quarter 2023. My finance and strategy teams are partnering with our strategic business unit leaders to rigorously track the ongoing progress from our value enhancement program. We look forward to regular reporting on our value capture beginning in 2023. Now, I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflect margin compression across all segments due to rising costs and weaker global demand. Our olefins and polyolefins businesses faced persistently high and volatile energy cost, coupled with lower demand, particularly in Europe and China. While our oxyfuel business and refining segment continue to earn margins above historical averages and demand for fuels remained strong, results were sequentially lower following peak margins in the second quarter of 2022. Higher cost for energy, raw materials, labor and transportation negatively impacted our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Across our European assets, September year-to-date energy costs are $1.8 billion higher than the same period in 2020. During the quarter, we recognized $84 million in cost related to the exit from our refining business. We expect to incur a similar amount for refining exit costs during each of the next five quarters. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. My view is that we're seeing some moderating in the headwinds around the energy costs and feedstock costs in Europe, and that could be short-lived. If we have a cold winter, then we might see that reverse. But longer term, obviously, one of the things that we're going to be looking at are ways to improve the competitiveness of our assets. What can we do to make the flexibility of our feed slate and the energy consumption that we have in those assets more competitive. And frankly, some of that is going to be related to our CO2 reduction targets because believe it or not, that is a way that we will improve competitiveness is by finding lower CO2 energy by making the assets more efficient and improving our cost position. So a lot of things are going to happen over time here. And we're currently very focused on what's happening in the short term, but don't let that make you think that we're not thinking longer term about how we position ourselves more competitively in the region. And Peter, you want to maybe make some comments from an enterprise perspective to help the analysts and investors kind of think sequentially as well. I mean, things lagged down substantially in August versus July. It was pretty dramatic. And those reasons were highlighted in our release today and then September deteriorated further. And as we look forward to October, it should be a bit better than September. And as you pointed out, we are seeing some relief in both feedstocks and energy costs. And I would say, broadly, it feels like we're kind of finding maybe a bottom. But to be clear, Q4 will be sequentially lower than Q3. We're facing into persistent inflation, high-cost energy, weaker seasonal demand and we're missing fixed cost absorption with all the idled and curtailed assets, which are heavier curtailed in Q4. So again -- and we're also experiencing the full effect of lower prices from the third quarter. So again, dramatic drop-off from July to August. So we will be sequentially down. Yes. Maybe I'll reinforce a couple of things. So I mean, no doubt, the current environment has implications for our spending plans, both this year and next year. And then as you would expect, we are taking appropriate actions in particular in Europe. And as Peter said, our value enhancement program will also help. So it's incremental, but interestingly, it's also sustainable. . And then we have a great team, and we've demonstrated our ability to navigate difficult environments like in 2020, where we covered our full dividend and capital program with cash from operations. We already operate lean which gives us an advantage versus others. And as Peter also said, that said, our view on safety and reliability is steadfast. We don't want to destroy long-term value put our assets in parallel. So again, we're confident in our ability to manage and actually come out stronger on the other side."

            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and thank you, Peter, for your kind remarks at the beginning of the call. Please turn to Slide 13 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Following a record second quarter, EBITDA for the segment declined to the third quarter of $360 million. Styrene margins deteriorated to a loss as market supply improved following second quarter industry outages. Oxyfuel margins declined relative to the second quarter, but remained above historical averages. Propylene oxide margins continued to moderate on softer demand for durable goods. In the fourth quarter, lower benzene and ethylene raw material costs are expected to improve styrene margins and bring the styrene business closer to breakeven. As we expect, lower seasonal demand will lead to further margin compression across most of the remaining IND product lines. Despite the improving outlook for styrene, we have decided to idle production at our Dutch propylene oxide and styrene monomer joint venture during the months of November and December due to the high energy costs and weaker European demand. Overall, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 75% capacity during the fourth quarter. We remain on track to start up our new PO/TBA plant in Houston during the first quarter of 2023. Lastly, as we have completed the validation steps for the IND portion of the value enhancement program, and we look forward to the implementation plans to be done by year-end. Now let's turn to Slide 14 and discuss the results of the refining segment. The third quarter EBITDA decreased to $190 million on moderating margins following an extraordinarily strong second quarter demand for refined products. In the third quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread declined to about $47 per barrel, but remains well above historical averages. Due to planned maintenance, we operated the refinery at 80% of capacity with an average crude rate of 215,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect continued strength in the Maya 2-1-1 spread driven by a tight market and strong demand. We plan to run the refinery above 90% capacity during the fourth quarter. The successful completion of the planned maintenance during the third quarter demonstrates our commitment to safely operate these assets with high reliability until we exit the refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Thank you, Frank. And yes, I remember our visit through the Cataby facility quite well. I hope to see you again as we start up the new PO/TBA plant later next year or early next year, I should say. As it relates to your question, the operating rates in the third quarter were about 75%. So we're basically steady or equivalent quarter-on-quarter. Some of the differences as far as what we're operating is around my comments that I made earlier in the presentation. So we'll be idling the P11 or the propylene oxide styrene monomer plant in Maasvlakte and the way that we -- what we will do with that is we'll have the opportunity to help improve the styrene supply demand as well as run our PO/TBA plants at higher capacity."

            "name": "Ken Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Americas segment. Third quarter O&P Americas EBITDA decreased to $559 million. In North America, the combination of customer destocking and expectations of additional supply from new assets resulted in lower product prices. During the fourth quarter, we expect lower seasonal demand and further capacity additions will keep markets well supplied. Margin pressures could be offset by moderating feedstocks and energy costs. Also, with lower demand, we expect continued easing of logistical constraints. LyondellBasell will continue to reduce operating rates to match lower demand and manage our inventories. We expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at a rate of approximately 75% in the fourth quarter. While market conditions remain challenging, we continue to proactively advance our long-term strategy. We recently announced a new partnership with Cyclyx and ExxonMobil to build a 150,000-ton plastic waste sorting facility in Houston. Beyond recycling, we announced our participation in an industry consortium to evaluate a low-carbon hydrogen production facility along the U.S. Gulf Coast. We are moving quickly and decisively to increase circularity and reduce our carbon footprint. Now please turn to Slide 12 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. European markets were severely pressured by tight gas supplies and higher energy costs that reduced demand from both plastic converters and downstream consumers. LyondellBasell's European volumes declined due to extended downtime at our ethylene cracker in France, and planned maintenance at our cracker in Germany. All of this combined to result in a third quarter EBITDA loss of $83 million. During the fourth quarter, we expect high and volatile energy costs will persist. In addition, slower seasonal demand is likely to add further pressure on European markets. Our O&P Europe businesses have responded to escalating energy prices by reflecting these costs and product pricing with energy surcharges. This year, we introduced variable formulas for these surcharges to account for energy volatility and ensure fairness in our pricing. Also, in response to lower demand and margins, we plan to operate our European assets at approximately 60% of capacity during the fourth quarter. As previously announced, we have postponed the restart of our integrated O&P site in France until early 2023. As in the Americas, we continue to focus on long-term strategies in support of our circular and low-carbon business. In October, we announced new partnerships for plastic waste sorting facilities in Germany and China and a fully automated mechanical recycling facility in India. These partnerships allow us to swiftly develop fit-for-purpose facilities in each region, while addressing rapidly rising global demand for circular and renewable solutions. Finally, I want to express how excited I am about the opportunities with the value enhancement program that Peter mentioned. Across the board, we see ideas being generated to improve value capture in manufacturing, procurement and serving our customers more efficiently. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Yes, sure. P.J. Thank you for the question. what we've commented before has not changed in terms of our targets looking out to 2030, we're making very good progress on reaching that 30% reduction that we put out there. When you start talking about some of the other options around CO2 reduction like electrification or carbon sequestration certainly, things like the tax benefits that you see coming out of the IRA for CO2 sequestration is going to help. But we're going to look at all of those options in our portfolio. And as you can imagine, every site is a little bit different. It depends on the location of the site and what infrastructure is available around it. And we're going to keep exploring those in the coming months, and we'll be able to share more about that later. But right now, it's really more in the exploratory phase and assessing what the potential is for these technologies today. Sure, Jeff. Thanks for the question. Good to hear from you. So we've done a lot of investigation into that, as you can imagine, because what we're seeing in the China market, we're at historically low spreads there and a lot of that is driven by the new capacity coming on. But our view is a lot of that oil is actually going into the state-owned refiners and not being passed on to the market in terms of lower priced feedstocks for the polymers. What's happening in China is really more related just to the higher capacity and the lower demand that we're seeing there. So that is going to be the larger driver in the even midterm -- what we really want to see is the growth come back in the China market, which we've not seen as of yet, and you may recall, going back to even the first quarter earnings call, we were talking about expecting to see some recovery in demand in China already after Chinese New Year, and that just has not materialized. So once we see that and that demand starts to absorb all of the new capacity, then I think you're going to start to see a return to a more normal level of spreads in China. Some of that market. They've been doing some premarketing for quite a while now. So Obviously, going back to what I had said earlier, just around China, what's going to be very meaningful is overall for the market supply demand is going to be the return to growth in the market. And these assets, like any are going to get absorbed. I'm sure they're very competitive assets based on the feedstock situation in the U.S. So -- there will be a period of time now where we're going to have to weather that and absorb that in exited Q3 is where I expect us to be in Q4. So things like Michael had referred to earlier, things really dropped off in the middle of Q3, and we've kind of levelled off in that range. So what we're doing now is taking actions that we can control to improve our cash flow and be able to meet demand without being cash suboptimal here. I think you've hit it. Again, it's going to be getting more growth back in the market and seeing some of the headwinds around feedstocks and energy come off, which right now is hard to predict. Yes, that's right. I mean, we certainly -- we've adjusted and what you've seen even with the adjustment to the utilization rates that we've communicated is we're adjusting the utilization rate to match what we see with our demand and we'll continue to do that in the fourth quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Kim. I'm extremely excited to be joining the Advanced Polymer Solutions team. With integration now complete, I look forward to increasing our agility, speed and customer focus to maximize the value of this business. Now let's review the third quarter results on Slide 15. Third quarter EBITDA was $66 million. Margins in the Compounding & Solutions business and the Advanced Polymers business were both pressured by higher feedstock and energy costs. Volumes for our catalloy roofing polymers decreased due to unplanned downtime at one of our major customers. We expect similar results from this segment during the fourth quarter with a small volume improvement from increased automotive production. In my initial meetings with our APS customers have witnessed the considerable and growing demand for circular and low-carbon solutions. The APS business provides a natural extension of the value chain for LyondellBasell's sustainable solutions, and our team is actively addressing these opportunities. As Peter mentioned, we believe that our APS platform has a lot of potential. While our team will have some autonomy to instil a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter."

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.  Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time today until August 29 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13729909.  Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael McMurray; Ken Lane, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins; Torkel Rhenman, EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives and Refining; and Jim Guilfoyle, EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions and Supply Chain. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook.  Before turning the call over to Peter, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, and impairments that we have discussed on past calls. LCM adjustments are related to our use of last in first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Impairment charges were recognized to write down assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments include the noncash impairment of $69 million in the second quarter of 2022 that reflects the exit of our polypropylene business in Australia and the noncash impairment of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 and that reflects our evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of impairments and LCM inventory adjustments. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with a short introduction of myself on Slide #3.  I'm very grateful to be here on my first earnings call since becoming CEO of LyondellBasell on May 23. I grew up in Belgium and undertook an education as a chemical engineer with a specialization in polymer engineering. During my more than 32 years in the chemical industry, I have had the pleasure of working with LyondellBasell as a customer, a supplier and a partner. During my time with Bayer, we invested in Lyondell's technology and assets while forming joint ventures for the production of propylene oxide. At Treofan, LyondellBasell was our largest polypropylene supplier. And at Neste, we partnered with LyondellBasell to achieve the world's first commercial production of polyethylene and polypropylene from Neste's sustainable bio-based feedstocks. Since joining the Board of Directors in February and then starting as CEO in May, I have been meeting extensively with stakeholders around the world to learn more about how LyondellBasell has been so successful in creating value.  More importantly, we have been asking ourselves how to best position the company to sustainably capture further value for years to come. I've always admired LyondellBasell's rich legacy of innovation and technology development. And I am pleased to confirm that our commitment and passion for safety and operational excellence or deeply embedded in our culture. These qualities will serve as well as work gets underway to advance our capabilities to capture latent value embedded within the company and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials, while reducing our carbon footprint.  As Dave mentioned, additional members of our executive committee will join our earnings calls starting today. I believe that it is important for our investors to get to know our excellent leaders at LyondellBasell better. And I'm really impressed by this team, their market knowledge and leadership and their passion for safety and value creation.  Let's now turn to Slide #4 to discuss our excellent results during the second quarter. I am very happy with the outstanding work that LyondellBasell's leadership and employees have accomplished. This is a great way to start and gives me a lot of confidence for the future. Our businesses delivered strong earnings and cash generation during the second quarter and driven by record results from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment and strong refining margins.  LyondellBasell's broad portfolio provided clear benefits as revenue grew sequentially by 13% while margins expanded to support a more than 20% improvement in EBITDA. Earnings were $5.19 per share and EBITDA was $2.5 billion, which resulted in $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, our company generated an impressive 24% return on invested capital over the last 12 months.  Let's turn to Slide #5 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership is outstanding and well known. As the CEO, I will make sure that safety remains a consistent and unwavering cornerstone of our company's culture. During my career, I have witnessed that companies that are leaders in safety are also best-in-class in reliability and productivity, and as a result, in value creation.  In 2022, the year-to-date total recordable incident rate for our global workforce improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This represents substantial progress towards our ultimate goal of zero injuries. I want to commend all of our employees and contractors for their clear commitments to goal zero.  On Slide #6, we highlight some of our recent progress towards our sustainability goals. LyondellBasell's products, technologies and solutions provides very important contributions to a more sustainable world. In addition, we have committed to industry-leading sustainability targets that improve this value. Over the past few weeks, we signed 4 renewable power purchase agreements for 380 megawatts of electrical generation capacity in Texas. These wind and solar projects will be able to supply more than 10% of LyondellBasell's global electricity needs and represents meaningful progress towards the company's climate goal to procure a minimum of 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  These projects are expected to reduce the company's annual carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 370,000 tonnes and represents the average annual electricity needs from about 100,000 U.S. homes.  In addition to our renewable energy goals, LyondellBasell is growing our production of plastics utilizing renewable feedstocks under our CirculenRenew brands. Last year, we processed 12,000 tons of renewable feedstock in Europe, and we are forecasting to increase this number to 40,000 tonnes across both Europe and the United States during 2022. This material is being run through our existing ethylene cracker assets in Westling, Germany and Channelview, Texas with the goal to increase scale over the coming years since we see that the demand for these products is growing.  The growth of renewable feedstocks is one part of our broader mission to expand the reach of our sustainable products, including those sold under the Circulen brands. Since launching our Circulen brands in 2019, we have sold over 140,000 tonnes of products based on recycled and renewable feedstock. This represents more than the amount of polyethylene and polypropylene consumed by the population of Houston in 1 year. LyondellBasell is doing more than simply talking about the circular economy. We are building real businesses that can help provide a more sustainable future for our customers and society.  Please turn to Slide #7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the second quarter, our business portfolio delivered $2.5 billion of EBITDA, an improvement of $430 million compared to the prior quarter. LyondellBasell results reflect how our global business portfolio can serve changing consumer needs. As in-person activities resume and global travel recovers, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand. Strong North American demand and favorable naphtha costs supported margins for our products in the Americas and Europe, respectively, while higher ethane and energy costs as well as inflation created headwinds in these regions.  We started to see moderating European demand due to high inflation at the end of the second quarter and continue to pass through elevated energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products where possible. During the quarter, China's zero COVID measures and logistics constraints continued to impact both regional and global markets. We expect progress in China will continue to be challenging over the next few months, but anticipate that demand will recover towards the end of 2022.  Let us turn to Slide #8 and review LyondellBasell's earnings power over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. From 2011 to 2019, our portfolio of businesses delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Favorable markets and our growing asset base delivered $9.2 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, an increase of nearly 40% over the prior cycle average. With the commissioning of our new propylene oxide capacity underway, we expect that LyondellBasell's stepped up earnings performance will provide resilience through the next business cycle. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin with describing how the step-up in our earnings is leading to increased cash generation from our business. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards $8.3 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months.  During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted over 90% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 26% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on extending our disciplined track record of capital allocation to provide for reinvestment in the company and generous returns for our shareholders.  After generating $1.6 billion in cash from operations during the second quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through a $5.20 per share special dividend, a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend that paid another $1.19 per share, all while repurchasing 45 million of our shares during the quarter.  We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with approximately $530 million in capital expenditures with a large portion funding our nearly completed world-scale PO/TBA plant. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11.  During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered nearly $2.5 billion of EBITDA. Our results reflect record profitability in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, driven by strong oxyfuels margins while our refining margins benefited from increased demand for transportation fuels. Conversely, margins in our O&P businesses encountered headwinds from rising costs for ethane feedstocks and moderating European demand.  One modeling item of note. Our original full year pension expense guidance of approximately $55 million did not include a second quarter $94 million noncash pension settlement charge that impacted earnings by $0.22 per share. As a result, our 2022 pension expense is expected to increase to approximately $180 million.  During the third quarter, we anticipate that we will begin recording costs related to our planned exit from our refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Second quarter EBITDA was relatively flat at $905 million. North American demand for polyolefins continue to be very strong. Higher costs for ethane and energy pressured olefin margins and offset the benefits of improved polymer prices. During the third quarter, we expect continued strength in demand for polymers utilized in flexible packaging. But elevated costs for feedstocks and energy as well as continuing export supply chain constraints and market headwinds are likely to pressure margins.  Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher ethylene prices and relatively flat feedstock costs resulted in slightly higher second quarter EBITDA of $228 million. LyondellBasell's volumes declined due to downtime at our French cracker and moderating European demand for polymers in June. The extended maintenance in France resulted in an impact of $65 million to the segment during the second quarter.  During the third quarter, we expect seasonally slower summer demand and continued higher energy costs associated with tight gas supply, which will pressure European markets. Also, with China demand remaining sluggish due to zero COVID measures, the European market is also facing pricing pressure from dislocated Middle Eastern and Asian imports. Toward the end of this year, potential benefits from China's reopening could provide tailwinds for our businesses. With that, I'll turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record second quarter segment EBITDA of $675 million. During the quarter, styrene results benefited from tight market supply. We are beginning to see that softer demand for durable goods is leading to moderation in propylene oxide margins.  In the third quarter, we expect margin compression across most product lines. Oxyfuel margins are also moderating but expected to remain elevated at levels well above historical averages. The steady success of our Intermediates and Derivatives segments is rooted in the Advantage Technologies, underpinning our propylene oxide business.  On Slide 15, let me highlight the cost advantages of LyondellBasell's propylene oxide production. The chart on the right depicts the global cost curve for producing propylene oxide by asset. The lower an asset is positioned on the curve, the greater the cost advantage. As you can see, LyondellBasell's assets that produce propylene oxide with a tertiary butyl alcohol co-product are on the lowest or most favorable part of the cost curve. PO/TBA assets represent roughly 15% of global capacity and derive their advantage from favorable costs for butane raw materials and strong pricing for the clean burning high-octane oxyfuel products produced from tertiary butyl alcohol. LyondellBasell's plants that produce propylene oxide with the styrene monomer co-products are the next lowest cost technology and represent 35% share of global capacity.  Much of the industry produces propylene oxide using older, higher-cost technologies such as the chlorohydrin process. With the recent escalation in chlorine prices, the cost curve for chlorohydrin-based propylene oxide has only steepened, creating hardships for producers using this technology. LyondellBasell's advantage PO/TBA technology provides an excellent platform to address increasing global demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. Propylene oxide is used in the production of polyurethanes, first-time materials that saves energy by producing insulation and reducing weight in a wide range of applications.  Oxyfuels are clean-burning, high-oxygen gasoline blending components that increase fuel efficiencies and improves air quality by reducing harmful emissions.  Let's continue with Slide 16 with an update on our PO/TBA project that we are completing here in Houston. This is the largest greenfield investment in LyondellBasell's history and will deliver much needed capacity to serve growing demand for these products that provide sustainable solutions for our planet.  We are thrilled to have nearly completed construction and we have already begun commissioning the oxyfuel assets, depicted in the photo on the right. The PO/TBA plant commissioning will begin during the fourth quarter, and we expect the integrated facility to start up in first quarter of 2023.  Our ramp-up during 2023 will not provide for full year of production but continued market strength is likely to support stronger margins than the mid-cycle economics depicted on this line. With LyondellBasell's sells advantaged technology and affordable shale advantage butane feedstocks are new capacity starting up with the support of favorable markets.  Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $418 million, with improved margins driven by increased demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread expanded significantly to about $56 per barrel. We operated the refinery at 94% of capacity with an average crude throughput of 252,000 barrels per day. In the near term, the Maya 2-1-1 spread is moderating from second quarter levels. We plan to run the refinery about 87% of capacity during the third quarter to perform a limited scope of planned maintenance. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Guilfoyle: Thank you, Torkel. Now let's review the results from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Our Compounding and solutions business continued to be pressured by the slow recovery in automotive markets. In the first half of 2022, automotive production was 3% below the same period last year. Supply chain disruptions and raw material shortages continue to impact the recovery and therefore, our compounding and solutions business. Industrial construction markets have demonstrated strength as catalloy demand and margins supported higher advanced polymer results and a second quarter EBITDA for the segment of $118 million.  We expect similar results for the segment in the third quarter as the gradual recovery in automotive production improves volumes while rising costs impact margins. A more significant step-up in earnings will be dependent upon stronger automotive production and the resolution of raw material constraints. And with that, I will return the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you again, team, for this impressive quarter. The closeouts on our segments, let's turn to Slide #19, and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward, our Senior Vice President for R&D, Technology and Sustainability. I have always been highly impressed by the strength of LyondellBasell's international innovation and technology capabilities, the broad technology portfolio and our leading market position. Very clearly, innovation is a core part of LyondellBasell's DNA.  Second quarter EBITDA was $112 million, supported by strong licensing revenue and record year-to-date catalyst demand. While new licensing activities slowed we have noted a recent shift in our licensing demand away from commodity polymers. 4 of our 5 new licenses this year were sold in Asia to produce low-density polyethylene vinyl acetate copolymers used in solar panel laminations and encapsulants that support the world's rising demand for renewable energy.  In the third quarter, we expect our licensing revenue and catalyst volumes to moderate. This segment is likely to produce results similar to that seen in the first or second quarter of 2021. Now let me summarize the second quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide #20.  LyondellBasell's second quarter results benefited from a balanced portfolio that captured considerable value with very efficient cash conversion. Margin expansion in our oxyfuels and refining businesses and solid demand for our products more than offset higher feedstock and energy costs. Our management team and Board understands and respects the power of this portfolio. We are unwavering and our disciplined approach to capital allocation and demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns during the second quarter.  LyondellBasell is making measurable progress towards our ambitious interim and long-term goals for the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions while developing sustainable businesses based on recycled and renewable materials. Our aim is to build upon our initial work, scale or reach and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials while reducing our carbon footprint.  I began my journey as CEO with a commitment to leverage LyondellBasell's strengths and capture value from both near-term and long-term opportunities. Over the past several months, we have undertaken an in-depth examination of our company to identify a north star that will provide clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. including our progress on circularity and sustainability.  We are consulting with all stakeholders to ensure we have aligned on a durable and resilient strategy that will serve LyondellBasell well across a range of scenarios for many years. Last week, we had a very productive interim review with our board on this topic. We're planning further alignment during our Board meetings in the second half of the year with our work aimed towards communicating or our north star externally during an Investor Day in early 2023. In addition, the second work stream is underway to identify, prioritize and execute on value opportunities that exist in LyondellBasell's current business structure. Thus far,our work has identified a considerable number of opportunities such as creep capacity, debottlenecks, automation and energy saving opportunities that can be delivered through modest investments by leveraging LyondellBasell's existing strengths.  We believe the value of these projects is considerable and actionable. I am committed to communicating our initial assessment of this value opportunity and our time line for realization during our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to sharing our vision for LyondellBasell and the additional value we plan to unlock from our company. We are now pleased to take your questions. Thank you.\nOperator: . Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne: Yes. I appreciate the Slide 15 on your outlook for PO. And Torkel, maybe you could comment on what do you think that slide or that chart would have looked like historically, clearly, now you have some reasons for it to be shaped like that with lower butane and higher benzene and certainly higher chlorine, but is part of this just because TVA is so valuable right now? And is the shape of this year outlook in the years to come? Is that part of your EBITDA forecast?\nTorkel Rhenman: So thank you for the question. I think as we looked at this, we've -- and if you compare it to historical averages, it's actually widened in terms of the differential in terms of our competitive advantage. And that's primarily driven right now the value of the core products. And of course, that will fluctuate over the cycle.  But fundamentally, we see for the next -- where we are right now and in the coming next 2 years, we are in a very favorable cycle situation. Then as you drive -- if you look at energy costs going up, that will also favor our technology. So I think fundamentally, where we are and look at it right now, I think our technology is very advantaged.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.\nJoshua Spector: I wanted to ask on polypropylene in the U.S. It looks like spreads were pretty volatile during the quarter, maybe starting at around $0.20 a pound to start up near $0.50 in May and kind of round tripped back down. So I'm curious, one, is that similar to how your earnings progressed through the quarter?Two, what drove that volatility? And three, what's your outlook for the next couple of quarters in terms of the spreads.\nPeter Vanacker: Let me give that question, I mean, to you, Ken, you're close to that business, of course.\nKenneth Lane: Sure. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Josh, for the question. Look, a lot of the volatility that you've seen in the polypropylene market this year has been related to a lot of downtime in the industry, particularly in the U.S. I think that a lot of that is behind us. Inventory levels are, frankly, in our favor in polypropylene.  So I'd say, looking forward, we mentioned some softening demand trends that we see around durable applications. We see that in the polypropylene area as well, but we still see very good demand in packaging. So net-net,we're going to see some softening, some headwinds in polypropylene, but continued spreads that are going to be above historic averages.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: Could you talk a little bit about naphtha costs in Europe and in Asia, which during the quarter seem to disconnect from oil? So could you just sort of discuss what you see the outlook is there and what impact it will have on your European operations?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, Vincent. A very good question on naphta and especially what is happening in Europe and in China. As you noticed well, I mean, naphtha is decoupling at the moment from what is happening on the oil side. But I think one needs to look at China and when demand will pick up substantially again in China, and that eventually would reestablish, in our opinion, the relationship between naphtha and crude oil.  Giving a little bit of further information, I mean, around China, then we have seen a little bit already or an uptick in demand in China, but it was very modest during the second quarter. We expect that, especially after October, there will be quite some incentives coming out as it has been in the past. So towards the end of the year, beginning of next year, one may expect that demand in China would substantially pick up and be back on normal levels of growth that we have seen over the cycle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Congrats, Peter, on a very solid first quarter as CEO. May you have many more. If I could follow up on Europe and energy. How do you see the situation playing out if there is a material natural gas shortage, what would be the impact on Lyondell? What are the actions that you're taking to -- that you would take to possibly mitigate that?\nPeter Vanacker: Frank, let me also say, I mean,  Yes. Of course, I mean, it's in the current situation in Europe. We are very close in to what is happening there. That's what you may expect, of course, in such a situation that we have an internal crisis management team up and running that we are developing different business continuity plans that we have analyzed I mean our dependency also on nat gas.  And I must say, I mean, that the integrated crackers that we have, they show a low dependency on nat gas, mostly supplied by oil-based fuels. I want to put it in perspective as where the biggest impact is eventually is in Germany and Italy, but German revenues for us are based upon last year's revenue, about 7% of total revenue and Italy is about 4% of total revenue.  We believe that we can continue to run our crackers in Europe, but we have been doing at an 85-plus percent range. So from that perspective, believe that we -- if everything runs, let's say, in a normal way, we would be quite robust in continuing our operations independent of the fact the effective North Stream One returns, so back to 40% or would be lower than the 40%.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nBhavesh Lodaya: Peter, this is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. Across the press release and your presentation, you highlighted the impact from lockdowns in China and a potential reversal towards the end of the year. Can you add some color around the profitability of your Chinese operations and your peers in the region?  And then assuming we are in this, say, higher for longer crude price environment, what is the market appetite for higher prices, which is probably required to get to your historical margins there?\nPeter Vanacker: Let me take them in the first question, John. It's clear, I mean that China operations, I mean, profitability at this point in time is low. But due to the fact, I mean, with our investments that we made in China that we are in the first quartile in terms of delivered costs, cash costs. So we have a favorable position in China. But generally spoken, I mean, the profitability is very low.  Having said that, also, again, I'd like to put it into perspective. I mean, China for us in terms of revenues or total revenues is let's say, a bit lower than 5%. So I don't want to overemphasize that either. Then on your second question can I give that to you, Ken?\nKenneth Lane: Sure. Absolutely. So look, what we see happening in China in particular, is prices are going to move where feedstock go at this point. People are cutting back utilization. A lot of the assets are, frankly, underwater, and you're making a decision almost daily about whether to continue to operate or is it better to shut down. So that's putting a floor under pricing today. So from my perspective, there's nowhere to go but up in China these days.  There will be a reopening impact. The question is always going to be about when, not if. But like Peter said, we've got very good new assets, both in O&P and I&D. So we're still confident in the outlook beyond the end of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy: A question for Ken perhaps. I was wondering if you could comment on the U.S. propylene market. It seems to have gotten a bit sloppy here in recent months. I believe the U.S. July contract price declined another $0.04 earlier this week, and it makes 4 consecutive monthly declines of 35% negative or so. Can you comment on both sides, supply/demand, what you're seeing there and whether we might expect that pattern to reverse in coming months?\nKenneth Lane: Sure, Kevin. Thank you for the question. Yes, I do see -- expect to see that trend in propylene reverse in the U.S. In fact, I would -- I think we're going to see that in August already. We're starting to see spot prices move up again for propylene. And I'll go back to the answer that I gave earlier. There's been a lot of downtime for polypropylene assets in the U.S., and that's put some link into the propylene market.  What's happening now is you're starting to see those assets run again, and you're going to start to see people refilling inventory levels because of all the downtime that we've had with polypropylene and that's going to start to bring the propylene price back up a little bit here in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.\nMichael Leithead: I think industry consultants are forecasting, I don't know, about $0.15 to $0.20 a pound decline in U.S. polyethylene prices between now and the first quarter. I guess, do you agree with that assessment? And why or why not?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, I'll take that, and then Ken will also further elaborate on your question, Mike. I mean what we continue to see is very good demand, I mean, in the marketplace. And yes, maybe a little bit of slowdown like we alluded to in terms of durable goods. But then there are a couple of other points that I want to highlight here as well is, if you look in Europe and in North America at the average inventory in terms of car builds, then we are today, substantially below -- actually at the lowest level since the last 5 years.  And that has not been -- if you look at what the automotive industry has been saying in their quarterly calls, it's not because they have a lack of demand, but it's mainly still because of the supply chain, and they are expecting that towards the end of the year a lot of these issues will be resolved. So the key question there will be, how will that actually then result in restoring inventory levels in that particular industry as 1 data point.  The other data point is definitely also with regards to the more the feedstock costs and feedstock costs have been exceptionally high, I would describe them, I mean, during Q2. But if we look at natural gas towards the end of the year and eventually also the impact on ethane prices, we tend to believe, I mean that, that should moderate, I mean, during the second half of 2022.And as a result and also have its impact on the margins. Ken, do you want to elaborate a little bit further on this?\nKenneth Lane: Yes. I guess the one thing that I'll add is when we look at this, we've got a lot of levers that we pull here in terms of managing our margins. We do expect to see energy and feedstock costs continue to be elevated in the back half of the year, but they're going to moderate versus the second quarter.  There will be things that we're doing around our feed slate, our product slate, our channel selection market segments because we still do, to Peter's point, see strength in some of our market segments. And we'll be gearing our portfolio to serve that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Nice quarter. I think as you guys know, polyethylene demand was fairly resilient during the pandemic, up 2% in 2020. And so just curious, what you think demand would be for polyethylene if we are or going into a recession as we head into '23?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thanks for your comment, Michael, on the second quarter. Highly appreciated. Definitely, I mean, on -- in terms of PE demand, Ken has shown -- I think it was in the previous quarter, also how resilient I mean, PE demand is actually even if you talk about downturns in the industry, if you call them recession or not. And this is something that we continue to see as well. I mean moving forward that we expect that PE demand will continue to be resilient in the next quarters. Ken, do you agree?\nKenneth Lane: I absolutely agree. I think what we've seen in the past is that polyethylene is typically recession-resistant. And even this year, with China being down, we still expect to see growth in the kind of 2% to 3% range globally. So -- as China comes back, I think you're going to see that growth number go up even higher, which is what we've seen historically.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.\nPrashant Juvekar: Peter, a question on refining. You announced the refinery shutdown way before the actual shutdown? And if refining margins continue to remain high, would you be able to delay the refinery shutdown by putting in some incremental maintenance capital?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, P.J., thank you for your question. We've been very clear. I mean, the latest, I mean, by the end of we will shut down our refinery in Houston. Nothing has changed in that regard. It's simply because of the technical reasons. -- you need to eventually invest a huge amount of money to keep the refinery operating. And definitely, as I alluded to in my preliminary comments, safety has always been -- the most important thing that we are looking at in the company. So we will not, at the expense of safety, keep operating, I mean, the refinery, which means as a consequence, one would have to invest a huge amount of money. We've alluded to that above $1 billion, at least.  My experience is actually telling me that the moment you open up or react on, you willstart finding out that actually your $1 billion will not be sufficient, and it's going to be substantially higher in terms of the investments in the refinery. So nothing has changed towards what we have communicated before.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: If I could also follow up on the refinery issues.It's a multipart question. Are you in active negotiations to still sell the refinery? Or are you not in negotiations? Second, if you thought the return on capital was adequate, would you close it anyway because of your carbon reduction targets? Or how do you weigh the carbon reduction targets versus the return on capital? And thirdly, are you continually reassessing the return on capital based on your assessment of refining margins? Or have you already simply made the decision to exit?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, Jeff. I mean, for your very good questions. And let me go a little bit deeper. And what actually is the attention that we are having with regard I mean to the refinery, what are we actually looking at? I mean with the refinery I mean it's a very nice location that we have. We have very good assets also at the refinery.  So we're mainly looking at the fact, can we do -- what can we do else, I mean, with the assets that we have at the refinery? You're very familiar with the fact that we are making very good progress on our molecular recycling technology. So the advanced recycling technology development. And this site could be a very good fit for us to do very large investments. Nothing has been decided yet. As said, this is investigation, but we -- the more we look at it, I mean, the more we are inspired coming by it because we have very good equipment that we eventually could then use. So there could be quite a lot of synergies. So this is the direction of travel, Jeff, with regards, I mean, to the refinery.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Mizuho.\nChristopher Parkinson: Just given all the moving parts and spread compression across the intermediate and segment, -- can you just give the intermediate-term outlook in terms of spreads of the various businesses in there, including Oxyfuels, just to give us help us a little bit more perspective heading into 2023?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, Chris. I mean, let me first, I mean, again, make a couple of comments on that. When -- of course, I know LyondellBasell for quite a while, that's clear. But also when I started moving into my position,then what impressed me a lot is the diversity of the different products and solutions that we have in the portfolio. And as such, I call it a kind of a natural hedge because -- all the products are not following the same cycle and therefore, are hedging each other. So that is quite good, I mean, to have a portfolio like that.  And the best demonstration was, of course, on our earnings, I mean, during the second quarter as a result out of that. Now if we go a little bit deeper, I mean, we've talked a lot already about polyethylene and polypropylene and margins and so on. So I would put the focus maybe a little bit on the very important oxyfuels business that we have and the contribution of oxyfuels as an octane enhancer as you know. And then also with regards to positioning in terms of sustainability solution offerings. So Torkel if you can give a little bit of an update on the oxyfuels, what you see.\nTorkel Rhenman: Yes. No, thank you. So even instead of I&D, what we have through the portfolio, it's a very resilient portfolio in terms of over a cycle that they don't all follow the same cycle. And the oxyfuels is a really good example of that, where we see maybe the gasoline cracks moderatingbut the oxyfuels margins are expected to stay well above the historical averages. And it's the multitude of things that drives the margins there. It's also the advantaged butane cost that we see helping us looking forward, but then also the very strong demand for octane and that basically drives the premium of our oxyfuels above gasoline.  And that's also been a very strong factor for the excellent results, the record earnings that we had for Oxyfuels, and we think will remain at an elevated level?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts: In the presentation, you talked about continued strength in propylene oxide, but I think the release discussed some slowing in polyurethane markets, which I guess we'd expect with auto and appliances and construction. As you begin commissioning the new PO plant, do you plan to take downtime in other plants to kind of keep the market balanced if we are facing a slowdown there?\nTorkel Rhenman: As part of our start-up plan,we have other outages scheduled for other plants that we have delayed, so in terms of managing our supply on the PO. But we also expect that the plan to ramp up during the year. And we expect that for next year, we will produce about 50% of the annualized capacity from the plant.\nPeter Vanacker: John I mean start-up is scheduled, I mean, towards the end of Q1 2023. And as said, I mean, by Torkel, you gradually move into the name paid capacity volumes. So therefore, if you average it out over the year 2023, then it would be approximately we expect, I mean, 50% of the nameplate capacity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.\nHassan Ahmed: I just wanted to touch on O&P-EAI. In the press release, you guys, I believe, said that around 30% of the sort of feedstock slate out there was non-naphtha-based. So I just wanted to get a better sense of how we should think about the feedstock flexibility you have in your European operations. Are you sort of hitting the upper limit when you say that 30% was non-naptha?\nPeter Vanacker: Ken?\nKenneth Lane: I would not say we're hitting the upper limit. There are a lot of things that we can still do on the feed slate. As you know, naphtha has been favored. A lot of that is driven by not only the naphtha price, but also the co-product pricing. So that is a big lever for us, not only in Europe but also in U.S. markets, and we'll continue to find opportunities around the feed slate and optimize the portfolio as we go.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. I just wanted to drill down a little bit into O&P-Americas profitability. If you look ahead, I guess, into Q3 and the back half, we potentially have some slowing demand high consumer retail inventories and continued high feedstock. Do you expect the continued high feedstock slate to resist and I guess, support pricing? Or is the demand waiting to the that maybe we see some margin deterioration as we go through the next couple of quarters?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thanks, Arun. Let me take the first part of your question, then I will ask Ken, I mean, to further elaborate. You alluded already a bit to it. I mean in terms of demand, we continue to see, I mean, demand to be healthy. And of course, I mean, with our portfolio of products that we have, we can shift, I mean, more, I mean, to the consumer driven products packaging because as I said before, we expect that packaging will continue to be quite healthy, something that we have seen, I mean, in the past also in downturn period of the economy or recessions.  With regards, I mean, to the feedstocks, we said, I mean, pressure will continue to be high on the feedstock and on the energy cost level. Towards the end of the year, we expect a little bit of moderation, but still, I mean, the pressure will continue to be high. Ken?\nKenneth Lane: Yes. I think the only thing that I'll add to that is you do have new supply coming on, and that's going to be another headwind for us. But the good news is that we'll start to see some of these supply chain constraints unwind at the back end of the year, and that's going to help open up some channels to market. We also -- you had mentioned inventory levels. We're already seeing downstream consumers start to reduce inventory levels. So that -- that's actually already started taking place.  And I think one thing we're going to watch very closely, obviously, is going to be what's happening with the weather impacts on that becausethere is a sort of a natural tendency in this industry to start to pull the inventories down, and this is not necessarily a great time of year to do that. But of course, we'll be watching that closely and see how those things develop.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Kishan on for Steve. Just a question on IND. I'm just curious, I was wondering if Scope 3 emission standards would disadvantage the business long term? And then also with MTD prices normalizing, what might baseline earnings potential for I&D look like?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, good question. I mean, in the I&D business, I mean, Scope 3 emission standards. It's clear, of course, also that even if we have not clearly made a commitment on Scope 3, that we are deeply analyzing what are the emissions on Scope 3 that we have, we are approaching, of course, also our customers in discussions in reducing their Scope 3 emissions on the products that they are supplying to us. So that's work in progress.  But it is important, I mean, we are looking at it. And I'll give you one example. I mean we talked about the refinery beforehand. By shutting down the refinery, we're talking about approximately 40% of our global Scope 3 footprint that would be reduced. So we're talking here about 30 million, 40 million tonnes per year of scope 3 emissions that would be reduced just by that action. Talking about the applications, not necessarily at this point in time, we see a disadvantage because it is a -- Scope 3 is something that is extremely difficult, I mean, for the entire industry, I mean, to deal with. There is no clear accounting mechanism I mean for Scope 3. So lots of things that need to still be worked out, I mean, through legislation and how to account, I mean, for Scope 3 emissions. So immediate answer to that is we don't see that in terms of demand for those products that, that would have an impact, I would say, on the contrary, because the oxyfuels, if you talk about top fuels actually make a good contribution in that regard.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Peter, you mentioned strength in styrene in the quarter, but it is expected to weaken going forward. What's your outlook for styrene in the intermediate and longer term for you guys?\nPeter Vanacker: Give that question into Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman: Yes. Thank you. I think second quarter was driven by both strong demand but also primarily operational issues, scheduled and unscheduled outages, and we see margins probably softening here in third quarter and the second half of the year. And I think that there are growth areas, but there are also areas under pressure. Single-use plastics, of course, being one under pressure, but you also have strong and we've seen double-digit growth for EPS being used in insulation material -- so I would say that we probably have a moderate outlook in terms of margins in the immediate term.\nOperator: I am showing that there are no further questions. I will turn it back to Mr. Vanacker for closing comments.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you very much, I mean, for all the very thoughtful questions. I would say, as usual. And we look, of course, forward to sharing more of our plans with you about how we outlined of Brazil with advance on our strategy. And in addition to that, we also unlock additional value over the coming months. As said, you may expect when we are releasing our third quarter results that we are putting a number to the additional value that we believe we can capture and also a time line to that. And then invite you for the beginning of next year to a Capital Markets Day to talk about our strategy.  I wish you all a great weekend, and of course, stay healthy and stay safe. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Kenneth Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. Second quarter EBITDA was relatively flat at $905 million. North American demand for polyolefins continue to be very strong. Higher costs for ethane and energy pressured olefin margins and offset the benefits of improved polymer prices. During the third quarter, we expect continued strength in demand for polymers utilized in flexible packaging. But elevated costs for feedstocks and energy as well as continuing export supply chain constraints and market headwinds are likely to pressure margins.  Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. Higher ethylene prices and relatively flat feedstock costs resulted in slightly higher second quarter EBITDA of $228 million. LyondellBasell's volumes declined due to downtime at our French cracker and moderating European demand for polymers in June. The extended maintenance in France resulted in an impact of $65 million to the segment during the second quarter.  During the third quarter, we expect seasonally slower summer demand and continued higher energy costs associated with tight gas supply, which will pressure European markets. Also, with China demand remaining sluggish due to zero COVID measures, the European market is also facing pricing pressure from dislocated Middle Eastern and Asian imports. Toward the end of this year, potential benefits from China's reopening could provide tailwinds for our businesses. With that, I'll turn the call over to Torkel. Sure. Thanks, Peter. Thanks, Josh, for the question. Look, a lot of the volatility that you've seen in the polypropylene market this year has been related to a lot of downtime in the industry, particularly in the U.S. I think that a lot of that is behind us. Inventory levels are, frankly, in our favor in polypropylene.  So I'd say, looking forward, we mentioned some softening demand trends that we see around durable applications. We see that in the polypropylene area as well, but we still see very good demand in packaging. So net-net,we're going to see some softening, some headwinds in polypropylene, but continued spreads that are going to be above historic averages. Sure. Absolutely. So look, what we see happening in China in particular, is prices are going to move where feedstock go at this point. People are cutting back utilization. A lot of the assets are, frankly, underwater, and you're making a decision almost daily about whether to continue to operate or is it better to shut down. So that's putting a floor under pricing today. So from my perspective, there's nowhere to go but up in China these days.  There will be a reopening impact. The question is always going to be about when, not if. But like Peter said, we've got very good new assets, both in O&P and I&D. So we're still confident in the outlook beyond the end of the year. Sure, Kevin. Thank you for the question. Yes, I do see -- expect to see that trend in propylene reverse in the U.S. In fact, I would -- I think we're going to see that in August already. We're starting to see spot prices move up again for propylene. And I'll go back to the answer that I gave earlier. There's been a lot of downtime for polypropylene assets in the U.S., and that's put some link into the propylene market.  What's happening now is you're starting to see those assets run again, and you're going to start to see people refilling inventory levels because of all the downtime that we've had with polypropylene and that's going to start to bring the propylene price back up a little bit here in the back half of the year. Yes. I guess the one thing that I'll add is when we look at this, we've got a lot of levers that we pull here in terms of managing our margins. We do expect to see energy and feedstock costs continue to be elevated in the back half of the year, but they're going to moderate versus the second quarter.  There will be things that we're doing around our feed slate, our product slate, our channel selection market segments because we still do, to Peter's point, see strength in some of our market segments. And we'll be gearing our portfolio to serve that. I absolutely agree. I think what we've seen in the past is that polyethylene is typically recession-resistant. And even this year, with China being down, we still expect to see growth in the kind of 2% to 3% range globally. So -- as China comes back, I think you're going to see that growth number go up even higher, which is what we've seen historically. I would not say we're hitting the upper limit. There are a lot of things that we can still do on the feed slate. As you know, naphtha has been favored. A lot of that is driven by not only the naphtha price, but also the co-product pricing. So that is a big lever for us, not only in Europe but also in U.S. markets, and we'll continue to find opportunities around the feed slate and optimize the portfolio as we go. Yes. I think the only thing that I'll add to that is you do have new supply coming on, and that's going to be another headwind for us.

            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2022 results. Let's begin with a short introduction of myself on Slide #3.  I'm very grateful to be here on my first earnings call since becoming CEO of LyondellBasell on May 23. I grew up in Belgium and undertook an education as a chemical engineer with a specialization in polymer engineering. During my more than 32 years in the chemical industry, I have had the pleasure of working with LyondellBasell as a customer, a supplier and a partner. During my time with Bayer, we invested in Lyondell's technology and assets while forming joint ventures for the production of propylene oxide. At Treofan, LyondellBasell was our largest polypropylene supplier. And at Neste, we partnered with LyondellBasell to achieve the world's first commercial production of polyethylene and polypropylene from Neste's sustainable bio-based feedstocks. Since joining the Board of Directors in February and then starting as CEO in May, I have been meeting extensively with stakeholders around the world to learn more about how LyondellBasell has been so successful in creating value.  More importantly, we have been asking ourselves how to best position the company to sustainably capture further value for years to come. I've always admired LyondellBasell's rich legacy of innovation and technology development. And I am pleased to confirm that our commitment and passion for safety and operational excellence or deeply embedded in our culture. These qualities will serve as well as work gets underway to advance our capabilities to capture latent value embedded within the company and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials, while reducing our carbon footprint.  As Dave mentioned, additional members of our executive committee will join our earnings calls starting today. I believe that it is important for our investors to get to know our excellent leaders at LyondellBasell better. And I'm really impressed by this team, their market knowledge and leadership and their passion for safety and value creation.  Let's now turn to Slide #4 to discuss our excellent results during the second quarter. I am very happy with the outstanding work that LyondellBasell's leadership and employees have accomplished. This is a great way to start and gives me a lot of confidence for the future. Our businesses delivered strong earnings and cash generation during the second quarter and driven by record results from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment and strong refining margins.  LyondellBasell's broad portfolio provided clear benefits as revenue grew sequentially by 13% while margins expanded to support a more than 20% improvement in EBITDA. Earnings were $5.19 per share and EBITDA was $2.5 billion, which resulted in $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities. Altogether, our company generated an impressive 24% return on invested capital over the last 12 months.  Let's turn to Slide #5 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership is outstanding and well known. As the CEO, I will make sure that safety remains a consistent and unwavering cornerstone of our company's culture. During my career, I have witnessed that companies that are leaders in safety are also best-in-class in reliability and productivity, and as a result, in value creation.  In 2022, the year-to-date total recordable incident rate for our global workforce improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This represents substantial progress towards our ultimate goal of zero injuries. I want to commend all of our employees and contractors for their clear commitments to goal zero.  On Slide #6, we highlight some of our recent progress towards our sustainability goals. LyondellBasell's products, technologies and solutions provides very important contributions to a more sustainable world. In addition, we have committed to industry-leading sustainability targets that improve this value. Over the past few weeks, we signed 4 renewable power purchase agreements for 380 megawatts of electrical generation capacity in Texas. These wind and solar projects will be able to supply more than 10% of LyondellBasell's global electricity needs and represents meaningful progress towards the company's climate goal to procure a minimum of 50% of our electricity from renewable sources by 2030.  These projects are expected to reduce the company's annual carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 370,000 tonnes and represents the average annual electricity needs from about 100,000 U.S. homes.  In addition to our renewable energy goals, LyondellBasell is growing our production of plastics utilizing renewable feedstocks under our CirculenRenew brands. Last year, we processed 12,000 tons of renewable feedstock in Europe, and we are forecasting to increase this number to 40,000 tonnes across both Europe and the United States during 2022. This material is being run through our existing ethylene cracker assets in Westling, Germany and Channelview, Texas with the goal to increase scale over the coming years since we see that the demand for these products is growing.  The growth of renewable feedstocks is one part of our broader mission to expand the reach of our sustainable products, including those sold under the Circulen brands. Since launching our Circulen brands in 2019, we have sold over 140,000 tonnes of products based on recycled and renewable feedstock. This represents more than the amount of polyethylene and polypropylene consumed by the population of Houston in 1 year. LyondellBasell is doing more than simply talking about the circular economy. We are building real businesses that can help provide a more sustainable future for our customers and society.  Please turn to Slide #7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the second quarter, our business portfolio delivered $2.5 billion of EBITDA, an improvement of $430 million compared to the prior quarter. LyondellBasell results reflect how our global business portfolio can serve changing consumer needs. As in-person activities resume and global travel recovers, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand. Strong North American demand and favorable naphtha costs supported margins for our products in the Americas and Europe, respectively, while higher ethane and energy costs as well as inflation created headwinds in these regions.  We started to see moderating European demand due to high inflation at the end of the second quarter and continue to pass through elevated energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products where possible. During the quarter, China's zero COVID measures and logistics constraints continued to impact both regional and global markets. We expect progress in China will continue to be challenging over the next few months, but anticipate that demand will recover towards the end of 2022.  Let us turn to Slide #8 and review LyondellBasell's earnings power over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company. From 2011 to 2019, our portfolio of businesses delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. Favorable markets and our growing asset base delivered $9.2 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, an increase of nearly 40% over the prior cycle average. With the commissioning of our new propylene oxide capacity underway, we expect that LyondellBasell's stepped up earnings performance will provide resilience through the next business cycle. And with that, I will turn the call over to Michael first, then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you again, team, for this impressive quarter. The closeouts on our segments, let's turn to Slide #19, and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward, our Senior Vice President for R&D, Technology and Sustainability. I have always been highly impressed by the strength of LyondellBasell's international innovation and technology capabilities, the broad technology portfolio and our leading market position. Very clearly, innovation is a core part of LyondellBasell's DNA.  Second quarter EBITDA was $112 million, supported by strong licensing revenue and record year-to-date catalyst demand. While new licensing activities slowed we have noted a recent shift in our licensing demand away from commodity polymers. 4 of our 5 new licenses this year were sold in Asia to produce low-density polyethylene vinyl acetate copolymers used in solar panel laminations and encapsulants that support the world's rising demand for renewable energy.  In the third quarter, we expect our licensing revenue and catalyst volumes to moderate. This segment is likely to produce results similar to that seen in the first or second quarter of 2021. Now let me summarize the second quarter and the outlook for our company with Slide #20.  LyondellBasell's second quarter results benefited from a balanced portfolio that captured considerable value with very efficient cash conversion. Margin expansion in our oxyfuels and refining businesses and solid demand for our products more than offset higher feedstock and energy costs. Our management team and Board understands and respects the power of this portfolio. We are unwavering and our disciplined approach to capital allocation and demonstrated our commitment to shareholder returns during the second quarter.  LyondellBasell is making measurable progress towards our ambitious interim and long-term goals for the reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions while developing sustainable businesses based on recycled and renewable materials. Our aim is to build upon our initial work, scale or reach and establish LyondellBasell as a leader in serving the world's growing needs for circular and sustainable materials while reducing our carbon footprint.  I began my journey as CEO with a commitment to leverage LyondellBasell's strengths and capture value from both near-term and long-term opportunities. Over the past several months, we have undertaken an in-depth examination of our company to identify a north star that will provide clarity and guiding principles for our strategic decisions. including our progress on circularity and sustainability.  We are consulting with all stakeholders to ensure we have aligned on a durable and resilient strategy that will serve LyondellBasell well across a range of scenarios for many years. Last week, we had a very productive interim review with our board on this topic. We're planning further alignment during our Board meetings in the second half of the year with our work aimed towards communicating or our north star externally during an Investor Day in early 2023. In addition, the second work stream is underway to identify, prioritize and execute on value opportunities that exist in LyondellBasell's current business structure. Thus far,our work has identified a considerable number of opportunities such as creep capacity, debottlenecks, automation and energy saving opportunities that can be delivered through modest investments by leveraging LyondellBasell's existing strengths.  We believe the value of these projects is considerable and actionable. I am committed to communicating our initial assessment of this value opportunity and our time line for realization during our third quarter earnings call. We look forward to sharing our vision for LyondellBasell and the additional value we plan to unlock from our company. We are now pleased to take your questions. Thank you. Let me give that question, I mean, to you, Ken, you're close to that business, of course. Yes. Thank you, Vincent. A very good question on naphta and especially what is happening in Europe and in China. As you noticed well, I mean, naphtha is decoupling at the moment from what is happening on the oil side. But I think one needs to look at China and when demand will pick up substantially again in China, and that eventually would reestablish, in our opinion, the relationship between naphtha and crude oil.  Giving a little bit of further information, I mean, around China, then we have seen a little bit already or an uptick in demand in China, but it was very modest during the second quarter. We expect that, especially after October, there will be quite some incentives coming out as it has been in the past. So towards the end of the year, beginning of next year, one may expect that demand in China would substantially pick up and be back on normal levels of growth that we have seen over the cycle. Frank, let me also say, I mean,  Yes. Of course, I mean, it's in the current situation in Europe. We are very close in to what is happening there. That's what you may expect, of course, in such a situation that we have an internal crisis management team up and running that we are developing different business continuity plans that we have analyzed I mean our dependency also on nat gas.  And I must say, I mean, that the integrated crackers that we have, they show a low dependency on nat gas, mostly supplied by oil-based fuels. I want to put it in perspective as where the biggest impact is eventually is in Germany and Italy, but German revenues for us are based upon last year's revenue, about 7% of total revenue and Italy is about 4% of total revenue.  We believe that we can continue to run our crackers in Europe, but we have been doing at an 85-plus percent range. So from that perspective, believe that we -- if everything runs, let's say, in a normal way, we would be quite robust in continuing our operations independent of the fact the effective North Stream One returns, so back to 40% or would be lower than the 40%. Let me take them in the first question, John. It's clear, I mean that China operations, I mean, profitability at this point in time is low. But due to the fact, I mean, with our investments that we made in China that we are in the first quartile in terms of delivered costs, cash costs. So we have a favorable position in China. But generally spoken, I mean, the profitability is very low.  Having said that, also, again, I'd like to put it into perspective. I mean, China for us in terms of revenues or total revenues is let's say, a bit lower than 5%. So I don't want to overemphasize that either. Then on your second question can I give that to you, Ken? Well, I'll take that, and then Ken will also further elaborate on your question, Mike. I mean what we continue to see is very good demand, I mean, in the marketplace. And yes, maybe a little bit of slowdown like we alluded to in terms of durable goods. But then there are a couple of other points that I want to highlight here as well is, if you look in Europe and in North America at the average inventory in terms of car builds, then we are today, substantially below -- actually at the lowest level since the last 5 years.  And that has not been -- if you look at what the automotive industry has been saying in their quarterly calls, it's not because they have a lack of demand, but it's mainly still because of the supply chain, and they are expecting that towards the end of the year a lot of these issues will be resolved. So the key question there will be, how will that actually then result in restoring inventory levels in that particular industry as 1 data point.  The other data point is definitely also with regards to the more the feedstock costs and feedstock costs have been exceptionally high, I would describe them, I mean, during Q2. But if we look at natural gas towards the end of the year and eventually also the impact on ethane prices, we tend to believe, I mean that, that should moderate, I mean, during the second half of 2022.And as a result and also have its impact on the margins. Ken, do you want to elaborate a little bit further on this? Yes. Thanks for your comment, Michael, on the second quarter. Highly appreciated. Definitely, I mean, on -- in terms of PE demand, Ken has shown -- I think it was in the previous quarter, also how resilient I mean, PE demand is actually even if you talk about downturns in the industry, if you call them recession or not. And this is something that we continue to see as well. I mean moving forward that we expect that PE demand will continue to be resilient in the next quarters. Ken, do you agree? Well, P.J., thank you for your question. We've been very clear. I mean, the latest, I mean, by the end of we will shut down our refinery in Houston. Nothing has changed in that regard. It's simply because of the technical reasons. -- you need to eventually invest a huge amount of money to keep the refinery operating. And definitely, as I alluded to in my preliminary comments, safety has always been -- the most important thing that we are looking at in the company. So we will not, at the expense of safety, keep operating, I mean, the refinery, which means as a consequence, one would have to invest a huge amount of money. We've alluded to that above $1 billion, at least.  My experience is actually telling me that the moment you open up or react on, you willstart finding out that actually your $1 billion will not be sufficient, and it's going to be substantially higher in terms of the investments in the refinery. So nothing has changed towards what we have communicated before. Yes. Thank you, Jeff. I mean, for your very good questions. And let me go a little bit deeper. And what actually is the attention that we are having with regard I mean to the refinery, what are we actually looking at? I mean with the refinery I mean it's a very nice location that we have. We have very good assets also at the refinery.  So we're mainly looking at the fact, can we do -- what can we do else, I mean, with the assets that we have at the refinery? You're very familiar with the fact that we are making very good progress on our molecular recycling technology. So the advanced recycling technology development. And this site could be a very good fit for us to do very large investments. Nothing has been decided yet. As said, this is investigation, but we -- the more we look at it, I mean, the more we are inspired coming by it because we have very good equipment that we eventually could then use. So there could be quite a lot of synergies. So this is the direction of travel, Jeff, with regards, I mean, to the refinery. Yes. Thank you, Chris. I mean, let me first, I mean, again, make a couple of comments on that. When -- of course, I know LyondellBasell for quite a while, that's clear. But also when I started moving into my position,then what impressed me a lot is the diversity of the different products and solutions that we have in the portfolio. And as such, I call it a kind of a natural hedge because -- all the products are not following the same cycle and therefore, are hedging each other. So that is quite good, I mean, to have a portfolio like that.  And the best demonstration was, of course, on our earnings, I mean, during the second quarter as a result out of that. Now if we go a little bit deeper, I mean, we've talked a lot already about polyethylene and polypropylene and margins and so on. So I would put the focus maybe a little bit on the very important oxyfuels business that we have and the contribution of oxyfuels as an octane enhancer as you know. And then also with regards to positioning in terms of sustainability solution offerings. So Torkel if you can give a little bit of an update on the oxyfuels, what you see. John I mean start-up is scheduled, I mean, towards the end of Q1 2023. And as said, I mean, by Torkel, you gradually move into the name paid capacity volumes. So therefore, if you average it out over the year 2023, then it would be approximately we expect, I mean, 50% of the nameplate capacity. Ken? Yes. Thanks, Arun. Let me take the first part of your question, then I will ask Ken, I mean, to further elaborate. You alluded already a bit to it. I mean in terms of demand, we continue to see, I mean, demand to be healthy. And of course, I mean, with our portfolio of products that we have, we can shift, I mean, more, I mean, to the consumer driven products packaging because as I said before, we expect that packaging will continue to be quite healthy, something that we have seen, I mean, in the past also in downturn period of the economy or recessions.  With regards, I mean, to the feedstocks, we said, I mean, pressure will continue to be high on the feedstock and on the energy cost level. Towards the end of the year, we expect a little bit of moderation, but still, I mean, the pressure will continue to be high. Ken? Well, good question. I mean, in the I&D business, I mean, Scope 3 emission standards. It's clear, of course, also that even if we have not clearly made a commitment on Scope 3, that we are deeply analyzing what are the emissions on Scope 3 that we have, we are approaching, of course, also our customers in discussions in reducing their Scope 3 emissions on the products that they are supplying to us. So that's work in progress.  But it is important, I mean, we are looking at it. And I'll give you one example. I mean we talked about the refinery beforehand. By shutting down the refinery, we're talking about approximately 40% of our global Scope 3 footprint that would be reduced. So we're talking here about 30 million, 40 million tonnes per year of scope 3 emissions that would be reduced just by that action. Talking about the applications, not necessarily at this point in time, we see a disadvantage because it is a -- Scope 3 is something that is extremely difficult, I mean, for the entire industry, I mean, to deal with. There is no clear accounting mechanism I mean for Scope 3. So lots of things that need to still be worked out, I mean, through legislation and how to account, I mean, for Scope 3 emissions. So immediate answer to that is we don't see that in terms of demand for those products that, that would have an impact, I would say, on the contrary, because the oxyfuels, if you talk about top fuels actually make a good contribution in that regard. Give that question into Torkel. Yes. Thank you very much, I mean, for all the very thoughtful questions. I would say, as usual. And we look, of course, forward to sharing more of our plans with you about how we outlined of Brazil with advance on our strategy. And in addition to that, we also unlock additional value over the coming months. As said, you may expect when we are releasing our third quarter results that we are putting a number to the additional value that we believe we can capture and also a time line to that. And then invite you for the beginning of next year to a Capital Markets Day to talk about our strategy.  I wish you all a great weekend, and of course, stay healthy and stay safe. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin with describing how the step-up in our earnings is leading to increased cash generation from our business. In the second quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.6 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed towards $8.3 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months.  During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted over 90% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 26% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on extending our disciplined track record of capital allocation to provide for reinvestment in the company and generous returns for our shareholders.  After generating $1.6 billion in cash from operations during the second quarter, we returned $2.1 billion to shareholders through a $5.20 per share special dividend, a 5% increase to our quarterly dividend that paid another $1.19 per share, all while repurchasing 45 million of our shares during the quarter.  We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with approximately $530 million in capital expenditures with a large portion funding our nearly completed world-scale PO/TBA plant. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11.  During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered nearly $2.5 billion of EBITDA. Our results reflect record profitability in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment, driven by strong oxyfuels margins while our refining margins benefited from increased demand for transportation fuels. Conversely, margins in our O&P businesses encountered headwinds from rising costs for ethane feedstocks and moderating European demand.  One modeling item of note. Our original full year pension expense guidance of approximately $55 million did not include a second quarter $94 million noncash pension settlement charge that impacted earnings by $0.22 per share. As a result, our 2022 pension expense is expected to increase to approximately $180 million.  During the third quarter, we anticipate that we will begin recording costs related to our planned exit from our refining business at the end of 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken."

            "content": "Thank you, Torkel. Now let's review the results from our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Our Compounding and solutions business continued to be pressured by the slow recovery in automotive markets. In the first half of 2022, automotive production was 3% below the same period last year. Supply chain disruptions and raw material shortages continue to impact the recovery and therefore, our compounding and solutions business. Industrial construction markets have demonstrated strength as catalloy demand and margins supported higher advanced polymer results and a second quarter EBITDA for the segment of $118 million.  We expect similar results for the segment in the third quarter as the gradual recovery in automotive production improves volumes while rising costs impact margins. A more significant step-up in earnings will be dependent upon stronger automotive production and the resolution of raw material constraints. And with that, I will return the call back to Peter."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Torkel Rhenman",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 14 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record second quarter segment EBITDA of $675 million. During the quarter, styrene results benefited from tight market supply. We are beginning to see that softer demand for durable goods is leading to moderation in propylene oxide margins.  In the third quarter, we expect margin compression across most product lines. Oxyfuel margins are also moderating but expected to remain elevated at levels well above historical averages. The steady success of our Intermediates and Derivatives segments is rooted in the Advantage Technologies, underpinning our propylene oxide business.  On Slide 15, let me highlight the cost advantages of LyondellBasell's propylene oxide production. The chart on the right depicts the global cost curve for producing propylene oxide by asset. The lower an asset is positioned on the curve, the greater the cost advantage. As you can see, LyondellBasell's assets that produce propylene oxide with a tertiary butyl alcohol co-product are on the lowest or most favorable part of the cost curve. PO/TBA assets represent roughly 15% of global capacity and derive their advantage from favorable costs for butane raw materials and strong pricing for the clean burning high-octane oxyfuel products produced from tertiary butyl alcohol. LyondellBasell's plants that produce propylene oxide with the styrene monomer co-products are the next lowest cost technology and represent 35% share of global capacity.  Much of the industry produces propylene oxide using older, higher-cost technologies such as the chlorohydrin process. With the recent escalation in chlorine prices, the cost curve for chlorohydrin-based propylene oxide has only steepened, creating hardships for producers using this technology. LyondellBasell's advantage PO/TBA technology provides an excellent platform to address increasing global demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. Propylene oxide is used in the production of polyurethanes, first-time materials that saves energy by producing insulation and reducing weight in a wide range of applications.  Oxyfuels are clean-burning, high-oxygen gasoline blending components that increase fuel efficiencies and improves air quality by reducing harmful emissions.  Let's continue with Slide 16 with an update on our PO/TBA project that we are completing here in Houston. This is the largest greenfield investment in LyondellBasell's history and will deliver much needed capacity to serve growing demand for these products that provide sustainable solutions for our planet.  We are thrilled to have nearly completed construction and we have already begun commissioning the oxyfuel assets, depicted in the photo on the right. The PO/TBA plant commissioning will begin during the fourth quarter, and we expect the integrated facility to start up in first quarter of 2023.  Our ramp-up during 2023 will not provide for full year of production but continued market strength is likely to support stronger margins than the mid-cycle economics depicted on this line. With LyondellBasell's sells advantaged technology and affordable shale advantage butane feedstocks are new capacity starting up with the support of favorable markets.  Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results for our Refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $418 million, with improved margins driven by increased demand for gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. In the second quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread expanded significantly to about $56 per barrel. We operated the refinery at 94% of capacity with an average crude throughput of 252,000 barrels per day. In the near term, the Maya 2-1-1 spread is moderating from second quarter levels. We plan to run the refinery about 87% of capacity during the third quarter to perform a limited scope of planned maintenance. With that, I will turn the call over to Jim. So thank you for the question. I think as we looked at this, we've -- and if you compare it to historical averages, it's actually widened in terms of the differential in terms of our competitive advantage. And that's primarily driven right now the value of the core products. And of course, that will fluctuate over the cycle.  But fundamentally, we see for the next -- where we are right now and in the coming next 2 years, we are in a very favorable cycle situation. Then as you drive -- if you look at energy costs going up, that will also favor our technology. So I think fundamentally, where we are and look at it right now, I think our technology is very advantaged. Yes. No, thank you. So even instead of I&D, what we have through the portfolio, it's a very resilient portfolio in terms of over a cycle that they don't all follow the same cycle. And the oxyfuels is a really good example of that, where we see maybe the gasoline cracks moderatingbut the oxyfuels margins are expected to stay well above the historical averages. And it's the multitude of things that drives the margins there. It's also the advantaged butane cost that we see helping us looking forward, but then also the very strong demand for octane and that basically drives the premium of our oxyfuels above gasoline.  And that's also been a very strong factor for the excellent results, the record earnings that we had for Oxyfuels, and we think will remain at an elevated level? As part of our start-up plan,we have other outages scheduled for other plants that we have delayed, so in terms of managing our supply on the PO. But we also expect that the plan to ramp up during the year. And we expect that for next year, we will produce about 50% of the annualized capacity from the plant. Yes. Thank you. I think second quarter was driven by both strong demand but also primarily operational issues, scheduled and unscheduled outages, and we see margins probably softening here in third quarter and the second half of the year. And I think that there are growth areas, but there are also areas under pressure. Single-use plastics, of course, being one under pressure, but you also have strong and we've seen double-digit growth for EPS being used in insulation material -- so I would say that we probably have a moderate outlook in terms of margins in the immediate term."

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, Alex. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.  Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available at our Investor Relations website.  Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.  A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1 p.m. Eastern Time today until May 29 by calling 877-660-6853 in the United States and 201-612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13727006.  During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, the current market and our near-term outlook.  Before turning the call over to Ken, I would like to call your attention to the noncash lower of cost or market inventory adjustments, or LCM, in the impairments that we have discussed on past calls. LCM adjustments are related to our use of last in, first out or LIFO accounting and the volatility in prices for our raw materials and finished goods inventories. Impairment charges were recognized to write down assets to their estimated fair value. Impairments include the noncash impairment of $624 million in the fourth quarter of 2021 that reflects our evaluation of strategic options for the Houston refinery.  Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results, excluding the impacts of impairments and LCM inventory adjustments.  With that being said, I now would like to turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results. Today's teleconference marks my second earnings call as the interim CEO of LyondellBasell. And I would like to thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead the company over the past few months. Our incoming CEO, Peter Vanacker, joined our Board on February 25, and we're looking forward to him assuming his role as Chief Executive Officer on May 23. Peter and I have been talking over the past several months to ensure a smooth transition and a successful start to his leadership of our company. I know that Peter is very eager to engage with our employees, customers, investors and suppliers to help us build upon the momentum we have underway in LyondellBasell.  Before we get into the results, I would like to take a moment to address the tragic and unprovoked attacks unfolding in Ukraine. My heart breaks seeing so many people devastated and the resulting humanitarian crisis. At LyondellBasell, we are working to address the impacts of this crisis through our global corporate citizenship program, Advancing Good. The company and our employees have collectively donated more than $600,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Medical Corp.  LyondellBasell's presence in Russia and Ukraine is fairly limited. Less than 0.3% of our 2021 revenue came from Russia and a negligible amount from Ukraine. In March, we announced that LyondellBasell will not enter into any new business transactions or relationships with Russian state-owned entities. We also intend to discontinue business relationships with those companies to the extent legally possible.  Of course, we are also complying with all U.S. and international sanctions. While we have no manufacturing sites in Russia or Ukraine, we do have about 30 employees working in offices in Russia. Last week, we made the difficult decision to cease operations at our Moscow and Togliati offices. We have a local team in place to support our employees during this transition period.  At LyondellBasell, we believe in the power of many, and we hope many of you find ways to support the Ukrainian people and influence peace and stability across Europe.  Now let's review our first quarter results, starting with Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from solid global demand and improving markets for products from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $4 per share of earnings, $2 billion of EBITDA and $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities.  The start of the year is typically a seasonally slow period for the petrochemical industry. 2022 marks the first time since 2015 where LyondellBasell earned $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter, and our income of $4 per share establishes a new first quarter earnings per share record for the company. Despite a turbulent backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, ongoing supply chain challenges, and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, LyondellBasell is off to a great start in 2022.  Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership remains a consistent and unwavering component of our company's culture. In 2022, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors has improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This year, we are emphasizing the importance of instilling safety-related touch points during interactions that occur naturally throughout the workday at our facilities. Whether it's planned or spontaneous, these daily touch points provide powerful opportunities to convey authentic and impactful leadership related to safety performance. This personalized approach to safety improvement is yielding results.  During March, we had only 1 recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. This represents substantial progress toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries, and I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to our Goal Zero journey.  On Slide 5, we highlight the recent publication of the fifth edition of our annual sustainability report. This year's report updates our progress to our goals that help in addressing climate change, ending plastic waste and supporting a thriving society.  The cover graphic from the report highlights our focus on 2030 interim targets that track our progress toward longer-term goals. Last September, we accelerated these targets and set a goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. Our interim 2030 target is to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the area of circular plastics, our 2030 goal is to produce a meaningful share of our polymer production, 2 million tons per year from recycled and renewable based feedstocks.  And this year, we announced new targets supporting our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our goals are to achieve gender parity across our global senior leadership and increase the number of underrepresented groups in our U.S. senior leadership to reflect the general population within 10 years.  Please turn to Slide 6, where we highlight some of our recent collaborations to develop more sustainable products. First, we've collaborated with Nippon Paint to produce packaging for the Chinese market using LyondellBasell's mechanically recycled CirculenRecover polypropylene. The paint containers reuse post-consumer plastic waste and reduce reliance on fossil-based feedstocks.  Next, we show an example of the polyethylene tubes that we developed with our customer, Albea for L'Occitane shower scrub. The caps and tubes are designed to be fully recyclable and made with LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers that are produced from an advanced molecular recycling process using plastic waste. The redesigned tubes retain the iconic brand's look and feel while providing a new life for plastic waste and reducing consumption of fossil-based feedstocks.  Finally, we collaborated with several customers to develop clear polypropylene drink cups for McDonald's from our CirculenRenew polymers using renewable feedstocks produced by Neste from bio-based sources such as McDonald's used cooking oil. We also have a similar collaboration underway with CirculenRevive to make cups for Wendy's restaurants. Wendy's estimates that their couple will divert 10 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills over the first 2 years.  LyondellBasell's collaborations on sustainability extend both up and down the supply chain. In Houston, we helped form the Houston recycling collaboration to increase recycling rates and improve the availability of feedstock from plastic waste. And through our investment with closed loop partners, we have invested in material recovery facilities that support post-consumer plastic waste recycling in New York, New Jersey and Florida.  Also, we are making good progress in decarbonizing our electrical power consumption by eliminating coal at our Wesseling, Germany facility and establishing renewable power purchase agreements with partners.  In addition, we are collaborating with several peers on the development of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities for the Houston region that would help decarbonize our industry.  Notably, we want to acknowledge our decision to exit the refining business by the end of 2023. This was a difficult decision, but we determined that an exit is likely to provide the best outcome for the company. We will talk more about this decision later in this call. Nonetheless, on the sustainability front, the shutdown of the refinery is expected to reduce LyondellBasell's Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 15%.  Our strategy is to both leverage LyondellBasell's proprietary technology and collaborate with capable partners to advance our progress on circular plastics and decarbonization initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the first quarter, our business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA, similar to fourth quarter results. Despite volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, solid product demand supported margins for our products across most markets in Europe and the Americas. Supply disruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic created headwinds during the quarter.  While we remain watchful for signs of demand destruction from inflation, we have been largely successful in passing through higher energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products.  We expect the strict 0 COVID policies in China will continue to hinder growth and profitability in Asia during the second quarter.  At LyondellBasell, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand for transportation fuels as in-person activities resume and global travel recovers. We expect that favorable markets for transportation fuels will continue through next year.  Slide 8 depicts LyondellBasell's historical profitability. Over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. In today's strong market and with LyondellBasell's larger asset base, we delivered $9.7 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, nearly 45% above the prior cycle average.  LyondellBasell's earnings performance is clearly stepping up from prior business cycles. We are well positioned with a diversified portfolio and larger asset base with propylene oxide and oxyfuels growth underway to extend this performance into the next cycle.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin by extending the stepping-up theme to the substantial cash generation from our businesses.  In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward a new record of $8.6 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months. During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 88% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 23% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months.  The LyondellBasell team is highly focused on extending our proven track record of efficient cash generation to provide prudent reinvestment in our company and generous returns for our shareholders.  Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. With $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities, we funded our dividends and capital investments for the first quarter while continuing to repurchase shares and building some cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $400 million in capital expenditures. This includes our new world-scale PO/TBA plant starting up later this year.  We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.9 billion of cash and available liquidity. With our total debt at 1.2x trailing EBITDA, our leverage ratios are below our targeted range of 1.5 to 2.5, and we see no need for further deleveraging at this time.  Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11. As Ken mentioned, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect solid demand for our products and improving market conditions, benefiting our I&D and APS segments, offset by higher feedstock costs that compressed margins in our O&P-Americas segment.  Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. First quarter 2022 EBITDA was $911 million, $351 million lower than the fourth quarter 2021. Olefin results decreased approximately $170 million compared to the fourth quarter with lower margins due to higher feedstock costs and lower pricing for propylene and butadiene coproducts. We completed planned cracker maintenance at our La Porte, Texas site that contributed to lower volumes and resulted in our North America crackers operating at a rate of 82% during the quarter. Polyolefins results decreased approximately $185 million during the first quarter due to compressed margins driven by lower product prices and higher monomer costs. Stable demand led to relatively comparable volumes despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges.  In March, we achieved an increase in polyethylene contract prices to reverse fourth quarter trends of declining prices. We continue to see strong demand for our polymers as we head into the second quarter. We expect margin recovery as product prices rise reflect higher energy and feedstock costs and stronger summer demand tightens markets.  Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia International segment. Higher product prices and volumes offset rising cost in EAI markets, resulting in first quarter EBITDA of $188 million, $33 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $30 million. Olefins results increased about $25 million as margins improved driven by increased monomer prices that offset higher feedstock and energy cost. We operated our European crackers at a rate of 74% of capacity due to planned maintenance and feedstock supply disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $35 million compared to the prior quarter. Stable demand drove increased polyolefin price spreads and volumes despite higher energy and monomer cost. Historically low Asian polyolefin spreads and weaker volumes, driven by COVID-related lockdowns in China caused our joint venture equity income to decline by about $50 million. During the second quarter, we expect that volumes and integrated margins for the segment will be comparable to the first quarter as steady demand should support price increases and keep pace with increasing costs.  On April 13, we reached an agreement to sell our Australian polypropylene business to Veeva Energy. We expect a second quarter noncash asset impairment charge of approximately $70 million in the O&P EAI segment related to the sale of this business.  Last quarter, we provided guidance related to planned maintenance at our cracker in Berre, France. Due to additional work we now think this turnaround will impact second quarter EBITDA by about $50 million. As high inflation begins to trigger concerns about the potential for recession, it is instructive to review the resilience of polyethylene demand growth over the past 30 years.  In Slide 14, the chart depicts the strength of polyethylene demand relative to other markets through the last 4 U.S. recessions. As indicated by the turquoise line, PE demand is remarkably resilient and compounds at a fairly consistent rate of about 4%, meaningfully higher than typical GDP. Unlike U.S. housing and vehicle markets, PE demand is relatively inelastic and embedded in essential products for our modern lives. Polyethylene is a foundational building block for consumer staples with wide-ranging applications such as food packaging, daily hygiene supplies and health care products. And with a cost advantage from shale feedstocks, U.S. polyethylene production increasingly serves a global market. We expect these resilient growth trends will continue as more people in emerging markets gain purchasing power and increased consumption of these essential products for modern life.  Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust margin expansion in most businesses resulted in record first quarter EBITDA of $546 million, $294 million above the prior quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $95 million. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased $50 million as butane dial and other derivative margins expanded. Durable goods demand remained solid, resulting in comparable volumes for the quarter.  Intermediate chemicals results increased more than $30 million. Margins increased in most businesses, primarily styrene and acetyls driven by tight market supply. Volumes increased as a result of improved first quarter operations. Oxyfuels and related products results increased more than $125 million as margins improved on higher gasoline prices and moderation in the ratio of butane feedstock prices relative to crude oil. Prior to the pandemic, our oxyfuels business was a fairly reliable contributor to the profitability of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. With gasoline demand approaching pre-pandemic levels, we expect a return to typical performance for the oxyfuels business in 2022.  In the second quarter, we expect volumes to increase with seasonal strength in demand for durable goods from building and construction markets. Margins for oxyfuels and related products are expected to expand with typical seasonal reductions in butane feedstock costs and increased gasoline demand associated with summer travel. Planned maintenance at our butane dial facility in 1 of our 2 propylene oxide units located at our Channelview, Texas site is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million.  Over the past 2 weeks, we declared force majeure for several acetyl products due to equipment failure at our La Porte, Texas site. If we are successful in restarting acetyls production during May, we are currently estimating a second quarter EBITDA impact for the downtime of approximately $50 million.  Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Improving volumes from automotive production and higher margins resulted in first quarter EBITDA of $125 million, $101 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $55 million.  Compounding and solutions results increased $40 million. Volumes increased due to improved demand from automotive parts manufacturers relative to the fourth quarter. Margins increased through stronger product pricing and improving asset utilization, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Advanced results increased $10 million, driven by increased seasonal roofing demand for Catalloy and higher product prices. We expect results will be similar in the second quarter as automotive recovery continues to drive volumes while rising cost impact margins. The latest IHS production forecast predicts a 4% rise in 2022 global automotive builds and a 9% increase in 2023. Unfortunately, these reduced forecast delay a return to prior peak production levels until 2025.  Now please turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Our first quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a decrease of $2 million. Prior quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark expanded significantly to $30.82 per barrel, a $7.24 increase due to higher demand for gasoline and diesel partially offset by lower byproduct value. We operated the refinery at 95% of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput of 255,000 barrels per day. In April, Refining margins continue to expand with increasing demand for transportation fuels. We expect refining markets will remain favorable during the summer months.  Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, $70 million lower than the prior quarter's record level. The results were driven by lower licensing revenue and higher catalyst volumes and margins. We expect that second quarter profitability for our technology business will be slightly higher than the first quarter based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue milestones.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Michael. As I mentioned earlier, last week, we announced our decision to exit the crude oil refining business no later than the end of 2023. While these decisions are never easy, operation of the refinery beyond next year would require significant capital investment. After thoroughly analyzing our options, we determined that exiting the business was the best path forward.  Our intention is to safely operate the refinery at full range through the end of next year to meet strong market demand for transportation fuels. During that time, we will continue to consider potential transactions and alternatives for the site. As mentioned earlier, by exiting refining, LyondellBasell will make substantial progress in reducing the company's greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the refinery is located on 700 acres in the center of one of the world's leading integrated petrochemical hubs. The site's unique location provides LyondellBasell with valuable options for future growth, including further development of our circular businesses. We recognize that this decision affects our employees, their families and the community. Our employees and contractors at the refinery have delivered outstanding performance in safety, reliability, cost improvement and profitability over the past several years. We sincerely thank them for their contributions, and we are committed to supporting our people through this transition.  Now let me summarize the first quarter and our outlook with Slide 19. With all of the turbulence in the global economy, LyondellBasell's first quarter results illustrate the benefits of our global business portfolio and how demand for our products is highly resilient. While Asia is suffering from weak markets and historically low margins, demand in Europe and the Americas remains remarkably strong and consistent. Improving margins in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment offset first quarter margin compression in our O&P-Americas business. We expect PE chain margins to improve with higher seasonal demand supporting polymer price increases. Also, increased demand for transportation fuels is driving a recovery from pandemic-related weakness in our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. As a result, we expect cash generation will remain strong at LyondellBasell.  Just like our earnings, we are stepping up in our progress on sustainability. Today, we talked about a few of our collaborations with customers to develop circular and renewable products for meaningful applications. We are exiting refining and entering into agreements for the supply of renewable power that will drive significant progress on our path toward decarbonization. And we are raising our targets and expanding on our disclosures in our latest sustainability report.  We remain committed to prudent capital allocation. With robust cash generation, we plan to continue rewarding shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. We are consistent in our commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet and remain highly disciplined in our consideration of organic and inorganic growth investments.  The coming months are exciting times for LyondellBasell. Our businesses are generating resilient results despite volatile economic conditions. We are laying the groundwork for new, more sustainable business models that are likely to reshape value chains across our industry. And later this year, we will be starting up our new propylene oxide and oxyfuel assets during a period of robust margins and strong market demand.  Finally, on May 23, I look forward to welcoming our next CEO, Peter Vanacker, to lead LyondellBasell. I hope you share my enthusiasm about the future of our company under his leadership.  We're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Kieran on for Chris. I was wondering if you could just touch a little bit more in terms of what operating rates you're expecting in O&P-Americas in 2Q and throughout the year and maybe how you see that supporting what have been announced price increases throughout the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year?\nKenneth Lane: Thank you for your question. We are -- as we've said during the remarks, we are still very bullish on the demand outlook, especially in the Americas. So we see demand being very strong. We had a record sales month in the month of March for polyethylene in the Americas. And we see April actually looking to improve on that. So we're -- our outlook is that we'll continue to see operating rates, effective rates probably in the 90% or higher range. So that's going to be very supportive for the price increases that are in the market today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Polyethylene prices in China continue to fall. Maybe if you look at the month forward prices, maybe they're down $100 a ton to 13 30, something like that. What do you make of that, in that I would have thought that profitability was pretty poor even at higher prices, and there's been a movement upward in the other regions? And maybe you can also comment on the changing profitability of your Bora cracker.\nKenneth Lane: Jeff, thank you for your question. I hope you're doing well. Yes. So China, definitely, we've been seeing headwinds there. A lot of that related still to the COVID lockdowns. As you can imagine, the demand profile in China is quite challenging today with the amount of lockdowns that we see. Also, that's going to have an impact on some of the supply chain situation that we've seen.  So prices today have basically been moving pretty much with feedstock in China. And when you look across the industry there, you do see all of the crackers, all the operators of crackers, they are cutting back on rates. So even for us at the Bora joint venture, we've reduced rates, and we've got a first quartile asset. So we do expect that in the coming months, what's going to happen is you're going to see a reset around inventory. Inventories are not high in China by any means, and you're going to see the inventory come down. And then I expect you're going to see demand come back. That reopening impact is still to come in China. And so while yes, in the short term, we're seeing some challenges around profitability with the cracker assets in China. As I look out in the next few months, I expect that's going to reverse and you're going to see a snapback in demand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nStephen Byrne: I have a couple of questions about your Circulen products and perhaps about the Renew, which is derived from the renewable naphtha that you get from Neste. Do you see that as challenged longer term because that feedstock is -- can go into renewable diesel and get lots of credits and why not pursue kind of a carbohydrate path for that feedstocks such as ethanol-sourced ethylene?\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Steve, for your question. Yes. So we're very proud of the product portfolio that we're developing. As we've said before, we're looking forward to being a leader in the area of circularity and launch of our Circulen brand globally last year, you're beginning to see the fruits of that effort in the products that we've been developing together with customers today.  In our portfolio, as we look forward, the CirculenRenew part of our portfolio will probably be the smaller segment for us. We are much more bullish on our ability to develop the advanced recycling and mechanical recycling parts of our business. Those really fit very well with our technical capabilities around developing new processes, but also the application development that we do together with our customers. So we will continue to look for opportunities to develop the CirculenRenew portfolio, where we see that and where customers are demanding lower CO2 footprint products, which is primarily why you want those CirculenRenew products. But remember, when you're doing recycling, people are driving recycled content. So there is a little bit of a different value proposition for those 2 products in the marketplace.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets.\nBhavesh Lodaya: This is Bhavesh Lodaya for John. So in the I&D segment, clearly, very impressive results, especially in the first quarter. Now within the first quarter, a lot changed in March with the spike in crude. So could you describe or maybe break out the earnings seen in March versus the rest of the quarter? And then you mentioned that you expect oxyfuels earnings to return to more of a normalized earnings level this year. What would that new norm be?\nKenneth Lane: Thanks, Bhavesh, for the question. Yes. Look, Intermediates & Derivatives really had a very strong quarter, record first quarter for that segment. We did see, as the quarter progressed, especially even relative to the fourth quarter, margins recovered, strong demand pretty much across the portfolio. We got a little bit of relief on butane and the feedstock in the feed slate there. So all of those things are going to be very constructive as we go into the second quarter. Demand for all of the product lines that we have are continuing to look very good, and margins are going to continue to be above average.  So as Michael said in the prepared comments, we do believe that we're going to get those businesses back to a more normal level, but I would expect that they're going to be above mid-cycle for the foreseeable future just because we have very strong demand. And even in some of those businesses, we're seeing pretty supportive supply-side impact as well. Some of our competitors in these markets are also having issues with production. So all of that is going to lead to, I think, a very strong performance for I&D in the second quarter\nMichael McMurray: And Ken, what I'd also add specifically around oxyfuels, if you look at the decade kind of before the pandemic, the oxyfuels business kind of consistently delivered $400 million plus of EBITDA. So a very consistent generator of earnings.\nKenneth Lane: Great. Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews: I'm just curious about the decision in the quarter to build cash. It looks like $300 million of cash build versus $200 million of stock buybacks. Is there any particular thought behind that?\nKenneth Lane: So listen, thanks for your question, Vincent. We're absolutely committed to continuing to be very disciplined around our capital allocation. And, of course, returning excess cash to our shareholders is going to be a priority. Michael, maybe you can just comment a little bit on that.\nMichael McMurray: Yes. I mean, listen, I mean I'd say a couple of things. I mean, one, I think we've established a track record and a reputation of converting EBITDA into free cash flow. No need to further delever, and the balance sheet is in great shape. Our growth investments are paying dividends. Working capital this year should be flattish versus last year consumed almost $600 million. CapEx year-on-year is going to be flat. We'll grow the dividend. And then we're going to return a meaningful amount of cash to our shareholders. There's no message in the first quarter that we built a little bit of cash on [indiscernible].\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.\nHassan Ahmed: Ken, a question around natural gas and ethane supply and the current sort of pricing moves that we've seen. I mean, it just seems that there are a bunch of cross currents, right? Production levels seem to be rising, be it this year and beyond. But we're obviously also seeing a lot of LNG export opportunities popping up, right? I mean if my numbers serve me right, I mean we have approximately 14 LNG export terminal approved. So how should we think about the extreme near term as well as the longer-term natural gas and ethane side of things?\nKenneth Lane: Thanks for the question. Listen, a lot of -- there's been a lot of talk about what's happening, especially around natural gas. And of course, ethane is going to be following that. It's -- there are very much short-term impacts that are driving natural gas higher. If you look at just the energy complex, the alternative with coal is very high. So you don't see the switching, although production for natural gas is coming up. So normally, this time of year, we would see a bigger drop-off in natural gas pricing.  I think that's delayed just a little bit because of a couple of things. You've got colder weather in the northern part of the United States. So demand is continuing to be high -- the higher coal prices. Of course, we still are maxed out on LNG exports. Until the inventories get refilled in Europe and in the U.S., which I think will be sometime in kind of mid- to late summer, I think you're going to see a lot of volatility and elevated prices for natural gas, but I do expect it to come back into a more normal level sometime in the back end of the summer.  Now longer term, these export facilities take a long time to develop and build. So while those things are being constructed, I think what you're going to see, and we're seeing it even currently is that the production rates are going to accelerate. So you're going to see more production of the natural gas coming on, more production of oil coming on. Both of those, I think, production are up about 10% for both oil and gas since a year ago. All of that is going to be supported by generating more NGLs in the marketplace. So we still believe that longer term, the United States or the American position around ethane advantage is going to continue to be very durable.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi.\nPrashant Juvekar: Yes. Ken, some people believe that integrated polyethylene margins in the U.S. are depressed somewhat because we can't export as much and given that there's logistical issues. Do you agree with that assessment? How does China COVID play into that? And have you seen any export sort of improving over the last few months?\nKenneth Lane: P.J., thanks for your question. Look, no doubt we've talked about the headwinds around the supply chain and of course, there have been some constraints in rail movements in the U.S. and being able to move volume offshore even since the fourth quarter. That's not anything new. So I think I may have commented on this at the fourth quarter earnings call. That volume is already sold. So it's really not weighing on -- it's not like we can sell that twice.  We are really focused on watching the demand trends. The demand continues to be very supportive. We have been successful in being able to manage our shipments of products offshore to really minimize any impact to our sales. And I mentioned just a few minutes ago that we had a record sales month in the month of March, and we continue to see that being very robust. So what I expect to see is pricing in polyethylene in the U.S. started to turn back up and increase in the first quarter. That's going to continue as we go into the second quarter with higher demand, and I expect that we'll see some change some chain margin recovery in Q2.\nDavid Kinney: And P.J., this is Dave. I would just chime in that in March, we did see an increase in exports. It's up to nearly 40% of production in the month of March. And so we think that trend will continue into April once we get the numbers back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Sison: Nice start to the year. There's a lot of new capacity in China is supposed to come on stream for polyethylene. Given what you've mentioned in terms of pricing and sort of the profitability over there, do you think that those projects will come on stream, be delayed, maybe in some of you getting canceled? Any thoughts there?\nKenneth Lane: Yes, we've talked about this before. I do believe that, that is going to slow down some of these start-ups, and it's also going to slow down some of the decisions, especially when you look at the whole energy policy that's developing in China, all of those things are going to work to slow the development of the new capacity coming online there. But let's not forget, China is still a very big importer of polyethylene. And for us, what we're really focused on is watching the demand development. And as that demand returns and growth in China returns, it is going to absorb that new capacity. It's just a matter of when, it's not if. And so we're watching those trends and really focused on the demand side of the equation today.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS.\nJoshua Spector: Wondering if you could talk a little bit about your view on polypropylene supply demand. And I mean our view is the spreads in that chain remain pretty elevated. So curious how you think about the sustainability of that over the coming quarter years, et cetera. And with the refinery shutdown in the future, how do you think about your internal propylene balance after that? Is that something that needs to be managed? Or do you have options to deal with that?\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Josh. Listen, the polypropylene, we're actually very bullish on. The supply-demand fundamentals there are very good, and that's even in the absence of a strong automotive market. We expect to see spreads increasing coming into the second quarter. We've already announced a spread increase for May. The market continues to be very tight. Inventories have been coming down. And I do think that there is room to go up in polypropylene. So we're feeling very good about our position with polypropylene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: Could you talk about your PO business? What percent of this business is on spot versus long-term contracts was pass-through with sort of semi-fixed margins? And how do you expect those margins to trend next year given the start-up of your PO project in the U.S.?\nKenneth Lane: Thanks for the question, Aleksey. Listen, we -- propylene oxide is a core business for us, and it's one where we have a very strong position in. Margins have been improving in that business, especially in the Americas. And I expect now with some of the recent announcements around the supply side issues that we see in the industry, that's going to continue to be the case.  Demand continues to be good, and it's perfect timing, frankly, for us to be starting up our PO/TBA plant later this year. We're extremely excited about getting that asset online and ramping up production and sales in the first half of next year. So overall, I don't think we could have really timed it any better.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes. Can you talk about the alternative uses that you're exploring for the refinery in terms of what those are and what might drive those decisions?\nKenneth Lane: Kevin, thanks for your question. Listen, like we said, the refinery site is located in a very good positioned geographically on the ship channel, and it's got great pipeline connections with our cracker in Channelview. So there's a lot of kit there that we can look at that could be valuable in terms of if you think about circularity and some of the feedstocks that we would be using, a lot of those pyrolysis oil do need some hydrotreating and things like that. So they're fairly straightforward, but could be very synergistic with our circular ambition. So we're going to take the next several years to really study where we think that could go. And we think we can find some good value for that site in the mid- to long term to support our strategy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank.\nDavid Begleiter: Ken, can you talk about Hyperzone? How is that plan progressing and the selling? And what the type of premiums, if any, you're getting on the Hyperzone product?\nKenneth Lane: David, thanks for the question. So we had mentioned before that we had taken a shutdown in the fourth quarter to be able to make some repairs to that asset, and we've been continuing to work through that in the first quarter. So we are still not in a position yet to be, I would say, ratably selling the premium products from that asset. That's something that's going to build over the next 12 to 18 months. but the successful side of the equation there is that we've demonstrated the ability to make differential products that have differential product characteristics, and we have been able to get a premium on some of those, but it's frankly been very small volumes until now. So we view that as some of the upside that we're looking at. When we talk about stepping up, that's part of the upside that we're continuing to see in the next 12 to 18 months for the company.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Sean on for Steve. Just a quick check-in. In terms of the refinery, what might be the repurposing cost sort of facility if you choose to go in a different direction? And then also with an estimated $200 million in repurchases for this quarter, what might be some of the cadence moving forward for repurchases in light of the strong cash flow generation?\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Sean. I'll take the first question, and I'll let Michael take the second. So listen, it's way too early for us to be talking about any kind of repurposing costs around the refinery site. The focus for now is that we're going to operate that asset safely and reliably. Of course, we're going to keep a separate team that's going to be looking at some of the options for the future. But our priority right now is going to be really to stay focused on taking advantage of what we see in the marketplace today and really achieving a great result there and operating the assets safely.  So Michael, do you want to take the next question?\nMichael McMurray: Yes, sure. Thanks, Ken. While I probably won't give guidance on the level of share repurchase activity that we intend to execute to the balance of the year, what I can say is we expect to generate a lot of free cash flow. It's not our intention to build any meaningful cash balances on sheet. Therefore, the expectation is that you can expect that we're going to return copious amounts of free cash flow to our investors.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan: So yes, I guess a lot of questions have been asked around polyethylene. So maybe I'll ask a question on I&D and one on APS. So for I&D, I think peak earnings in the past, EBITDA has been around 2.1. Looks like you're headed to maybe the 1 6 level or so. And I think you mentioned that as a mid-cycle in the past. So is that still what you're thinking with the recovery in oxyfuels?  And then similarly with APS what's it going to take to get maybe to $800 million EBITDA level? Is that a more serious recovery in the automotive area?\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Arun. So yes, for I&A, I mentioned before, we are expecting to be above mid-cycle for that business. So I would say I would expect to be above the numbers that you're thinking about would be where we're at. For sure, we've got very strong tailwinds. And I had mentioned we had a record first quarter. So coming into the second quarter with demand even improving, we're very optimistic heading into the second half of the year or the second quarter going even into the second half of the year.  Now for APS, one of the biggest things that we need to see there, we've been able to successfully maintain margins and continue to improve on margins. The volume equation is what's really going to be impactful for that business. So as automotive comes back and we're able to really refill that pipeline and get the demand side up, that's going to be what's going to drive our results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.\nMatthew Blair: I know you're selling -- or you're closing the refinery at the end of '23, but right now, refining margins are pretty phenomenal looking at $30 Gulf Coast cracks, $70 diesel cracks. How should we think about your margin capture potential in Q2? Are you going to be able to capture these pretty phenomenal numbers? Or is there a reason to be cautious on just overall margin capture?\nKenneth Lane: Thanks, Matthew, for the question. Listen, for refining, yes, we're seeing very strong margins. The Maya 2-1-1 today is over $60, very strong diesel cracks, gasoline cracks strongest since 2015, inventories are low. So we're operating the assets very well, very high utilization rates. So to answer your question just very shortly, yes, we expect to be able to capture that margin uplift.\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing that there are no further questions. I will turn it back to Mr. Lane for closing comments.\nKenneth Lane: Thank you, Alex, and thanks, again, everyone, for your questions and interest in our company. Before we close the call, I want to emphasize the excitement that's building here at LyondellBasell around our future. We are generating resilient results, and we're going to be welcoming our new CEO, Peter Vanacker, in May, and we have our world-class PO/TBA asset starting up later this year.  There is a lot to look forward to, and we're excited about what lies ahead. We hope you'll join us in July as we update you on our second quarter results, and I wish you all a great weekend. Please stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 9, and let me begin by extending the stepping-up theme to the substantial cash generation from our businesses.  In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities that contributed toward a new record of $8.6 billion in cash from operations over the last 12 months. During the past 4 quarters, our team efficiently converted 88% of our EBITDA into cash. After accounting for sustaining capital reinvested in the business, we achieved a free operating cash flow yield of 23% relative to our market capitalization over the last 12 months.  The LyondellBasell team is highly focused on extending our proven track record of efficient cash generation to provide prudent reinvestment in our company and generous returns for our shareholders.  Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. With $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities, we funded our dividends and capital investments for the first quarter while continuing to repurchase shares and building some cash on the balance sheet. During the first quarter, we returned nearly $600 million to shareholders through our dividend and the repurchase of approximately 2.1 million shares. We continue to invest in maintenance and growth projects with more than $400 million in capital expenditures. This includes our new world-scale PO/TBA plant starting up later this year.  We ended the quarter with $1.8 billion of cash and short-term investments and $5.9 billion of cash and available liquidity. With our total debt at 1.2x trailing EBITDA, our leverage ratios are below our targeted range of 1.5 to 2.5, and we see no need for further deleveraging at this time.  Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on Slide 11. As Ken mentioned, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect solid demand for our products and improving market conditions, benefiting our I&D and APS segments, offset by higher feedstock costs that compressed margins in our O&P-Americas segment.  Let's begin the individual segment discussions on Slide 12 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. First quarter 2022 EBITDA was $911 million, $351 million lower than the fourth quarter 2021. Olefin results decreased approximately $170 million compared to the fourth quarter with lower margins due to higher feedstock costs and lower pricing for propylene and butadiene coproducts. We completed planned cracker maintenance at our La Porte, Texas site that contributed to lower volumes and resulted in our North America crackers operating at a rate of 82% during the quarter. Polyolefins results decreased approximately $185 million during the first quarter due to compressed margins driven by lower product prices and higher monomer costs. Stable demand led to relatively comparable volumes despite ongoing logistics and raw material challenges.  In March, we achieved an increase in polyethylene contract prices to reverse fourth quarter trends of declining prices. We continue to see strong demand for our polymers as we head into the second quarter. We expect margin recovery as product prices rise reflect higher energy and feedstock costs and stronger summer demand tightens markets.  Now please turn to Slide 13 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia International segment. Higher product prices and volumes offset rising cost in EAI markets, resulting in first quarter EBITDA of $188 million, $33 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $30 million. Olefins results increased about $25 million as margins improved driven by increased monomer prices that offset higher feedstock and energy cost. We operated our European crackers at a rate of 74% of capacity due to planned maintenance and feedstock supply disruptions resulting from the war in Ukraine. Combined polyolefin results increased approximately $35 million compared to the prior quarter. Stable demand drove increased polyolefin price spreads and volumes despite higher energy and monomer cost. Historically low Asian polyolefin spreads and weaker volumes, driven by COVID-related lockdowns in China caused our joint venture equity income to decline by about $50 million. During the second quarter, we expect that volumes and integrated margins for the segment will be comparable to the first quarter as steady demand should support price increases and keep pace with increasing costs.  On April 13, we reached an agreement to sell our Australian polypropylene business to Veeva Energy. We expect a second quarter noncash asset impairment charge of approximately $70 million in the O&P EAI segment related to the sale of this business.  Last quarter, we provided guidance related to planned maintenance at our cracker in Berre, France. Due to additional work we now think this turnaround will impact second quarter EBITDA by about $50 million. As high inflation begins to trigger concerns about the potential for recession, it is instructive to review the resilience of polyethylene demand growth over the past 30 years.  In Slide 14, the chart depicts the strength of polyethylene demand relative to other markets through the last 4 U.S. recessions. As indicated by the turquoise line, PE demand is remarkably resilient and compounds at a fairly consistent rate of about 4%, meaningfully higher than typical GDP. Unlike U.S. housing and vehicle markets, PE demand is relatively inelastic and embedded in essential products for our modern lives. Polyethylene is a foundational building block for consumer staples with wide-ranging applications such as food packaging, daily hygiene supplies and health care products. And with a cost advantage from shale feedstocks, U.S. polyethylene production increasingly serves a global market. We expect these resilient growth trends will continue as more people in emerging markets gain purchasing power and increased consumption of these essential products for modern life.  Please turn to Slide 15 as we take a look at our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Robust margin expansion in most businesses resulted in record first quarter EBITDA of $546 million, $294 million above the prior quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $95 million. First quarter propylene oxide and derivative results increased $50 million as butane dial and other derivative margins expanded. Durable goods demand remained solid, resulting in comparable volumes for the quarter.  Intermediate chemicals results increased more than $30 million. Margins increased in most businesses, primarily styrene and acetyls driven by tight market supply. Volumes increased as a result of improved first quarter operations. Oxyfuels and related products results increased more than $125 million as margins improved on higher gasoline prices and moderation in the ratio of butane feedstock prices relative to crude oil. Prior to the pandemic, our oxyfuels business was a fairly reliable contributor to the profitability of our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. With gasoline demand approaching pre-pandemic levels, we expect a return to typical performance for the oxyfuels business in 2022.  In the second quarter, we expect volumes to increase with seasonal strength in demand for durable goods from building and construction markets. Margins for oxyfuels and related products are expected to expand with typical seasonal reductions in butane feedstock costs and increased gasoline demand associated with summer travel. Planned maintenance at our butane dial facility in 1 of our 2 propylene oxide units located at our Channelview, Texas site is expected to impact second quarter EBITDA for Intermediates and Derivatives segment by approximately $80 million.  Over the past 2 weeks, we declared force majeure for several acetyl products due to equipment failure at our La Porte, Texas site. If we are successful in restarting acetyls production during May, we are currently estimating a second quarter EBITDA impact for the downtime of approximately $50 million.  Now let's move forward and review the results of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 16. Improving volumes from automotive production and higher margins resulted in first quarter EBITDA of $125 million, $101 million higher than the fourth quarter. Prior quarter results were impacted by LIFO inventory valuation charges of approximately $55 million.  Compounding and solutions results increased $40 million. Volumes increased due to improved demand from automotive parts manufacturers relative to the fourth quarter. Margins increased through stronger product pricing and improving asset utilization, partially offset by higher raw material and energy costs. Advanced results increased $10 million, driven by increased seasonal roofing demand for Catalloy and higher product prices. We expect results will be similar in the second quarter as automotive recovery continues to drive volumes while rising cost impact margins. The latest IHS production forecast predicts a 4% rise in 2022 global automotive builds and a 9% increase in 2023. Unfortunately, these reduced forecast delay a return to prior peak production levels until 2025.  Now please turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of our Refining segment. Our first quarter EBITDA was $148 million, a decrease of $2 million. Prior quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of approximately $50 million. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 benchmark expanded significantly to $30.82 per barrel, a $7.24 increase due to higher demand for gasoline and diesel partially offset by lower byproduct value. We operated the refinery at 95% of nameplate capacity with an average crude throughput of 255,000 barrels per day. In April, Refining margins continue to expand with increasing demand for transportation fuels. We expect refining markets will remain favorable during the summer months.  Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the results for our Technology segment. First quarter EBITDA was $103 million, $70 million lower than the prior quarter's record level. The results were driven by lower licensing revenue and higher catalyst volumes and margins. We expect that second quarter profitability for our technology business will be slightly higher than the first quarter based on the anticipated timing of licensing revenue milestones.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? And Ken, what I'd also add specifically around oxyfuels, if you look at the decade kind of before the pandemic, the oxyfuels business kind of consistently delivered $400 million plus of EBITDA. So a very consistent generator of earnings. Yes. I mean, listen, I mean I'd say a couple of things. I mean, one, I think we've established a track record and a reputation of converting EBITDA into free cash flow. No need to further delever, and the balance sheet is in great shape. Our growth investments are paying dividends. Working capital this year should be flattish versus last year consumed almost $600 million. CapEx year-on-year is going to be flat. We'll grow the dividend. And then we're going to return a meaningful amount of cash to our shareholders. There's no message in the first quarter that we built a little bit of cash on [indiscernible]. Yes, sure. Thanks, Ken. While I probably won't give guidance on the level of share repurchase activity that we intend to execute to the balance of the year, what I can say is we expect to generate a lot of free cash flow. It's not our intention to build any meaningful cash balances on sheet. Therefore, the expectation is that you can expect that we're going to return copious amounts of free cash flow to our investors."

            "name": "Kenneth Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2022 results. Today's teleconference marks my second earnings call as the interim CEO of LyondellBasell. And I would like to thank our Board of Directors for the opportunity to lead the company over the past few months. Our incoming CEO, Peter Vanacker, joined our Board on February 25, and we're looking forward to him assuming his role as Chief Executive Officer on May 23. Peter and I have been talking over the past several months to ensure a smooth transition and a successful start to his leadership of our company. I know that Peter is very eager to engage with our employees, customers, investors and suppliers to help us build upon the momentum we have underway in LyondellBasell.  Before we get into the results, I would like to take a moment to address the tragic and unprovoked attacks unfolding in Ukraine. My heart breaks seeing so many people devastated and the resulting humanitarian crisis. At LyondellBasell, we are working to address the impacts of this crisis through our global corporate citizenship program, Advancing Good. The company and our employees have collectively donated more than $600,000 to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Medical Corp.  LyondellBasell's presence in Russia and Ukraine is fairly limited. Less than 0.3% of our 2021 revenue came from Russia and a negligible amount from Ukraine. In March, we announced that LyondellBasell will not enter into any new business transactions or relationships with Russian state-owned entities. We also intend to discontinue business relationships with those companies to the extent legally possible.  Of course, we are also complying with all U.S. and international sanctions. While we have no manufacturing sites in Russia or Ukraine, we do have about 30 employees working in offices in Russia. Last week, we made the difficult decision to cease operations at our Moscow and Togliati offices. We have a local team in place to support our employees during this transition period.  At LyondellBasell, we believe in the power of many, and we hope many of you find ways to support the Ukrainian people and influence peace and stability across Europe.  Now let's review our first quarter results, starting with Slide 3. LyondellBasell's businesses are continuing to benefit from solid global demand and improving markets for products from our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated $4 per share of earnings, $2 billion of EBITDA and $1.5 billion of cash from operating activities.  The start of the year is typically a seasonally slow period for the petrochemical industry. 2022 marks the first time since 2015 where LyondellBasell earned $2 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter, and our income of $4 per share establishes a new first quarter earnings per share record for the company. Despite a turbulent backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, ongoing supply chain challenges, and volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, LyondellBasell is off to a great start in 2022.  Let's turn to Slide 4 and review our safety performance. LyondellBasell's commitment to safety leadership remains a consistent and unwavering component of our company's culture. In 2022, our year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors has improved by more than 40% to 0.12. This year, we are emphasizing the importance of instilling safety-related touch points during interactions that occur naturally throughout the workday at our facilities. Whether it's planned or spontaneous, these daily touch points provide powerful opportunities to convey authentic and impactful leadership related to safety performance. This personalized approach to safety improvement is yielding results.  During March, we had only 1 recordable injury across our global workforce of more than 19,000 employees. This represents substantial progress toward our ultimate goal of 0 injuries, and I want to thank all of our employees for their commitment to our Goal Zero journey.  On Slide 5, we highlight the recent publication of the fifth edition of our annual sustainability report. This year's report updates our progress to our goals that help in addressing climate change, ending plastic waste and supporting a thriving society.  The cover graphic from the report highlights our focus on 2030 interim targets that track our progress toward longer-term goals. Last September, we accelerated these targets and set a goal to achieve net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from our global operations by 2050. Our interim 2030 target is to reduce absolute emissions from our global operations by 30% relative to a 2020 baseline. In the area of circular plastics, our 2030 goal is to produce a meaningful share of our polymer production, 2 million tons per year from recycled and renewable based feedstocks.  And this year, we announced new targets supporting our diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Our goals are to achieve gender parity across our global senior leadership and increase the number of underrepresented groups in our U.S. senior leadership to reflect the general population within 10 years.  Please turn to Slide 6, where we highlight some of our recent collaborations to develop more sustainable products. First, we've collaborated with Nippon Paint to produce packaging for the Chinese market using LyondellBasell's mechanically recycled CirculenRecover polypropylene. The paint containers reuse post-consumer plastic waste and reduce reliance on fossil-based feedstocks.  Next, we show an example of the polyethylene tubes that we developed with our customer, Albea for L'Occitane shower scrub. The caps and tubes are designed to be fully recyclable and made with LyondellBasell's CirculenRevive polymers that are produced from an advanced molecular recycling process using plastic waste. The redesigned tubes retain the iconic brand's look and feel while providing a new life for plastic waste and reducing consumption of fossil-based feedstocks.  Finally, we collaborated with several customers to develop clear polypropylene drink cups for McDonald's from our CirculenRenew polymers using renewable feedstocks produced by Neste from bio-based sources such as McDonald's used cooking oil. We also have a similar collaboration underway with CirculenRevive to make cups for Wendy's restaurants. Wendy's estimates that their couple will divert 10 million pounds of plastic waste from landfills over the first 2 years.  LyondellBasell's collaborations on sustainability extend both up and down the supply chain. In Houston, we helped form the Houston recycling collaboration to increase recycling rates and improve the availability of feedstock from plastic waste. And through our investment with closed loop partners, we have invested in material recovery facilities that support post-consumer plastic waste recycling in New York, New Jersey and Florida.  Also, we are making good progress in decarbonizing our electrical power consumption by eliminating coal at our Wesseling, Germany facility and establishing renewable power purchase agreements with partners.  In addition, we are collaborating with several peers on the development of large-scale carbon capture and storage facilities for the Houston region that would help decarbonize our industry.  Notably, we want to acknowledge our decision to exit the refining business by the end of 2023. This was a difficult decision, but we determined that an exit is likely to provide the best outcome for the company. We will talk more about this decision later in this call. Nonetheless, on the sustainability front, the shutdown of the refinery is expected to reduce LyondellBasell's Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 15%.  Our strategy is to both leverage LyondellBasell's proprietary technology and collaborate with capable partners to advance our progress on circular plastics and decarbonization initiatives.  Please turn to Slide 7 to review our quarterly profitability. During the first quarter, our business portfolio delivered over $2 billion of EBITDA, similar to fourth quarter results. Despite volatile prices for energy and feedstocks, solid product demand supported margins for our products across most markets in Europe and the Americas. Supply disruptions triggered by the war in Ukraine and the COVID pandemic created headwinds during the quarter.  While we remain watchful for signs of demand destruction from inflation, we have been largely successful in passing through higher energy and feedstock costs in the prices of our products.  We expect the strict 0 COVID policies in China will continue to hinder growth and profitability in Asia during the second quarter.  At LyondellBasell, our oxyfuels and refining businesses are benefiting from increased demand for transportation fuels as in-person activities resume and global travel recovers. We expect that favorable markets for transportation fuels will continue through next year.  Slide 8 depicts LyondellBasell's historical profitability. Over the course of the first complete business cycle for our company, we delivered an average of $6.7 billion of EBITDA. In today's strong market and with LyondellBasell's larger asset base, we delivered $9.7 billion of EBITDA over the last 12 months, nearly 45% above the prior cycle average.  LyondellBasell's earnings performance is clearly stepping up from prior business cycles. We are well positioned with a diversified portfolio and larger asset base with propylene oxide and oxyfuels growth underway to extend this performance into the next cycle.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Michael, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Michael. As I mentioned earlier, last week, we announced our decision to exit the crude oil refining business no later than the end of 2023. While these decisions are never easy, operation of the refinery beyond next year would require significant capital investment. After thoroughly analyzing our options, we determined that exiting the business was the best path forward.  Our intention is to safely operate the refinery at full range through the end of next year to meet strong market demand for transportation fuels. During that time, we will continue to consider potential transactions and alternatives for the site. As mentioned earlier, by exiting refining, LyondellBasell will make substantial progress in reducing the company's greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition, the refinery is located on 700 acres in the center of one of the world's leading integrated petrochemical hubs. The site's unique location provides LyondellBasell with valuable options for future growth, including further development of our circular businesses. We recognize that this decision affects our employees, their families and the community. Our employees and contractors at the refinery have delivered outstanding performance in safety, reliability, cost improvement and profitability over the past several years. We sincerely thank them for their contributions, and we are committed to supporting our people through this transition.  Now let me summarize the first quarter and our outlook with Slide 19. With all of the turbulence in the global economy, LyondellBasell's first quarter results illustrate the benefits of our global business portfolio and how demand for our products is highly resilient. While Asia is suffering from weak markets and historically low margins, demand in Europe and the Americas remains remarkably strong and consistent. Improving margins in our Intermediates and Derivatives segment offset first quarter margin compression in our O&P-Americas business. We expect PE chain margins to improve with higher seasonal demand supporting polymer price increases. Also, increased demand for transportation fuels is driving a recovery from pandemic-related weakness in our oxyfuels and Refining businesses. As a result, we expect cash generation will remain strong at LyondellBasell.  Just like our earnings, we are stepping up in our progress on sustainability. Today, we talked about a few of our collaborations with customers to develop circular and renewable products for meaningful applications. We are exiting refining and entering into agreements for the supply of renewable power that will drive significant progress on our path toward decarbonization. And we are raising our targets and expanding on our disclosures in our latest sustainability report.  We remain committed to prudent capital allocation. With robust cash generation, we plan to continue rewarding shareholders through a growing dividend and share repurchases. We are consistent in our commitment to an investment-grade balance sheet and remain highly disciplined in our consideration of organic and inorganic growth investments.  The coming months are exciting times for LyondellBasell. Our businesses are generating resilient results despite volatile economic conditions. We are laying the groundwork for new, more sustainable business models that are likely to reshape value chains across our industry. And later this year, we will be starting up our new propylene oxide and oxyfuel assets during a period of robust margins and strong market demand.  Finally, on May 23, I look forward to welcoming our next CEO, Peter Vanacker, to lead LyondellBasell. I hope you share my enthusiasm about the future of our company under his leadership.  We're now pleased to take your questions. Thank you for your question. We are -- as we've said during the remarks, we are still very bullish on the demand outlook, especially in the Americas. So we see demand being very strong. We had a record sales month in the month of March for polyethylene in the Americas. And we see April actually looking to improve on that. So we're -- our outlook is that we'll continue to see operating rates, effective rates probably in the 90% or higher range. So that's going to be very supportive for the price increases that are in the market today. Jeff, thank you for your question. I hope you're doing well. Yes. So China, definitely, we've been seeing headwinds there. A lot of that related still to the COVID lockdowns. As you can imagine, the demand profile in China is quite challenging today with the amount of lockdowns that we see. Also, that's going to have an impact on some of the supply chain situation that we've seen.  So prices today have basically been moving pretty much with feedstock in China. And when you look across the industry there, you do see all of the crackers, all the operators of crackers, they are cutting back on rates. So even for us at the Bora joint venture, we've reduced rates, and we've got a first quartile asset. So we do expect that in the coming months, what's going to happen is you're going to see a reset around inventory. Inventories are not high in China by any means, and you're going to see the inventory come down. And then I expect you're going to see demand come back. That reopening impact is still to come in China. And so while yes, in the short term, we're seeing some challenges around profitability with the cracker assets in China. As I look out in the next few months, I expect that's going to reverse and you're going to see a snapback in demand. Thank you, Steve, for your question. Yes. So we're very proud of the product portfolio that we're developing. As we've said before, we're looking forward to being a leader in the area of circularity and launch of our Circulen brand globally last year, you're beginning to see the fruits of that effort in the products that we've been developing together with customers today.  In our portfolio, as we look forward, the CirculenRenew part of our portfolio will probably be the smaller segment for us. We are much more bullish on our ability to develop the advanced recycling and mechanical recycling parts of our business. Those really fit very well with our technical capabilities around developing new processes, but also the application development that we do together with our customers. So we will continue to look for opportunities to develop the CirculenRenew portfolio, where we see that and where customers are demanding lower CO2 footprint products, which is primarily why you want those CirculenRenew products. But remember, when you're doing recycling, people are driving recycled content. So there is a little bit of a different value proposition for those 2 products in the marketplace. Thanks, Bhavesh, for the question. Yes. Look, Intermediates & Derivatives really had a very strong quarter, record first quarter for that segment. We did see, as the quarter progressed, especially even relative to the fourth quarter, margins recovered, strong demand pretty much across the portfolio. We got a little bit of relief on butane and the feedstock in the feed slate there. So all of those things are going to be very constructive as we go into the second quarter. Demand for all of the product lines that we have are continuing to look very good, and margins are going to continue to be above average.  So as Michael said in the prepared comments, we do believe that we're going to get those businesses back to a more normal level, but I would expect that they're going to be above mid-cycle for the foreseeable future just because we have very strong demand. And even in some of those businesses, we're seeing pretty supportive supply-side impact as well. Some of our competitors in these markets are also having issues with production. So all of that is going to lead to, I think, a very strong performance for I&D in the second quarter Great. Thanks, Michael. So listen, thanks for your question, Vincent. We're absolutely committed to continuing to be very disciplined around our capital allocation. And, of course, returning excess cash to our shareholders is going to be a priority. Michael, maybe you can just comment a little bit on that. Thanks for the question. Listen, a lot of -- there's been a lot of talk about what's happening, especially around natural gas. And of course, ethane is going to be following that. It's -- there are very much short-term impacts that are driving natural gas higher. If you look at just the energy complex, the alternative with coal is very high. So you don't see the switching, although production for natural gas is coming up. So normally, this time of year, we would see a bigger drop-off in natural gas pricing.  I think that's delayed just a little bit because of a couple of things. You've got colder weather in the northern part of the United States. So demand is continuing to be high -- the higher coal prices. Of course, we still are maxed out on LNG exports. Until the inventories get refilled in Europe and in the U.S., which I think will be sometime in kind of mid- to late summer, I think you're going to see a lot of volatility and elevated prices for natural gas, but I do expect it to come back into a more normal level sometime in the back end of the summer.  Now longer term, these export facilities take a long time to develop and build. So while those things are being constructed, I think what you're going to see, and we're seeing it even currently is that the production rates are going to accelerate. So you're going to see more production of the natural gas coming on, more production of oil coming on. Both of those, I think, production are up about 10% for both oil and gas since a year ago. All of that is going to be supported by generating more NGLs in the marketplace. So we still believe that longer term, the United States or the American position around ethane advantage is going to continue to be very durable. P.J., thanks for your question. Look, no doubt we've talked about the headwinds around the supply chain and of course, there have been some constraints in rail movements in the U.S. and being able to move volume offshore even since the fourth quarter. That's not anything new. So I think I may have commented on this at the fourth quarter earnings call. That volume is already sold. So it's really not weighing on -- it's not like we can sell that twice.  We are really focused on watching the demand trends. The demand continues to be very supportive. We have been successful in being able to manage our shipments of products offshore to really minimize any impact to our sales. And I mentioned just a few minutes ago that we had a record sales month in the month of March, and we continue to see that being very robust. So what I expect to see is pricing in polyethylene in the U.S. started to turn back up and increase in the first quarter. That's going to continue as we go into the second quarter with higher demand, and I expect that we'll see some change some chain margin recovery in Q2. Yes, we've talked about this before. I do believe that, that is going to slow down some of these start-ups, and it's also going to slow down some of the decisions, especially when you look at the whole energy policy that's developing in China, all of those things are going to work to slow the development of the new capacity coming online there. But let's not forget, China is still a very big importer of polyethylene. And for us, what we're really focused on is watching the demand development. And as that demand returns and growth in China returns, it is going to absorb that new capacity. It's just a matter of when, it's not if. And so we're watching those trends and really focused on the demand side of the equation today. Thank you, Josh. Listen, the polypropylene, we're actually very bullish on. The supply-demand fundamentals there are very good, and that's even in the absence of a strong automotive market. We expect to see spreads increasing coming into the second quarter. We've already announced a spread increase for May. The market continues to be very tight. Inventories have been coming down. And I do think that there is room to go up in polypropylene. So we're feeling very good about our position with polypropylene. Thanks for the question, Aleksey. Listen, we -- propylene oxide is a core business for us, and it's one where we have a very strong position in. Margins have been improving in that business, especially in the Americas. And I expect now with some of the recent announcements around the supply side issues that we see in the industry, that's going to continue to be the case.  Demand continues to be good, and it's perfect timing, frankly, for us to be starting up our PO/TBA plant later this year. We're extremely excited about getting that asset online and ramping up production and sales in the first half of next year. So overall, I don't think we could have really timed it any better. Kevin, thanks for your question. Listen, like we said, the refinery site is located in a very good positioned geographically on the ship channel, and it's got great pipeline connections with our cracker in Channelview. So there's a lot of kit there that we can look at that could be valuable in terms of if you think about circularity and some of the feedstocks that we would be using, a lot of those pyrolysis oil do need some hydrotreating and things like that. So they're fairly straightforward, but could be very synergistic with our circular ambition. So we're going to take the next several years to really study where we think that could go. And we think we can find some good value for that site in the mid- to long term to support our strategy. David, thanks for the question. So we had mentioned before that we had taken a shutdown in the fourth quarter to be able to make some repairs to that asset, and we've been continuing to work through that in the first quarter. So we are still not in a position yet to be, I would say, ratably selling the premium products from that asset. That's something that's going to build over the next 12 to 18 months. but the successful side of the equation there is that we've demonstrated the ability to make differential products that have differential product characteristics, and we have been able to get a premium on some of those, but it's frankly been very small volumes until now. So we view that as some of the upside that we're looking at. When we talk about stepping up, that's part of the upside that we're continuing to see in the next 12 to 18 months for the company. Thank you, Sean. I'll take the first question, and I'll let Michael take the second. So listen, it's way too early for us to be talking about any kind of repurposing costs around the refinery site. The focus for now is that we're going to operate that asset safely and reliably. Of course, we're going to keep a separate team that's going to be looking at some of the options for the future. But our priority right now is going to be really to stay focused on taking advantage of what we see in the marketplace today and really achieving a great result there and operating the assets safely.  So Michael, do you want to take the next question? Thank you, Arun. So yes, for I&A, I mentioned before, we are expecting to be above mid-cycle for that business. So I would say I would expect to be above the numbers that you're thinking about would be where we're at. For sure, we've got very strong tailwinds. And I had mentioned we had a record first quarter. So coming into the second quarter with demand even improving, we're very optimistic heading into the second half of the year or the second quarter going even into the second half of the year.  Now for APS, one of the biggest things that we need to see there, we've been able to successfully maintain margins and continue to improve on margins. The volume equation is what's really going to be impactful for that business. So as automotive comes back and we're able to really refill that pipeline and get the demand side up, that's going to be what's going to drive our results. Thanks, Matthew, for the question. Listen, for refining, yes, we're seeing very strong margins. The Maya 2-1-1 today is over $60, very strong diesel cracks, gasoline cracks strongest since 2015, inventories are low. So we're operating the assets very well, very high utilization rates. So to answer your question just very shortly, yes, we expect to be able to capture that margin uplift. Thank you, Alex, and thanks, again, everyone, for your questions and interest in our company. Before we close the call, I want to emphasize the excitement that's building here at LyondellBasell around our future. We are generating resilient results, and we're going to be welcoming our new CEO, Peter Vanacker, in May, and we have our world-class PO/TBA asset starting up later this year.  There is a lot to look forward to, and we're excited about what lies ahead. We hope you'll join us in July as we update you on our second quarter results, and I wish you all a great weekend. Please stay safe."

During today's call, we will focus on fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, including an update on LYBs strategic progress. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Let's begin as we always do, with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2023, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. LYBs total recordable injury rate was 0.14, which is approximately 20% lower than the average of the prior three years. I want to congratulate our APS segments where injuries were 38% lower than 2022, a significant improvement from historical levels. We always use safety performance as a leading indicator of operational excellence and business performance. But there is no greater value than seeing every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health has when they began to work their working day. So turn to Slide four to discuss our financial results. 2023 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. While energy prices moderated in an environment of geopolitical unrest, markets were extremely cautious due to uncertainty about inflation and the potential for a more pronounced downturn in economic activity. Reported GDP growth in U.S. and China improved relative to 2022, the growth in petrochemicals was far below norms for our industry. Against that backdrop, LYB delivered earnings of $8.65 per share with an EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Cash generation was exceptional, and resulted in $4.9 billion of cash from operations. We have a highly efficient cash conversion ratio of 98%. We ended the year with $7.6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment grade balance sheet. And we exceeded our cost of capital with an 11% return on invested capital. In March of last year, we successfully launched our new strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York. Now let's turn to Slide five and briefly review the strategy. Our goal was to create focus, clarity, and alignments about direction LyondellBasell would be moving over the next five years and provide a clear vision of what the company would look like in 2027. Our strategy is built around three pillars, growing and upgrading the core, building a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business and stepping up performance and culture. In growing and upgrading the core, we are investing in businesses that fit with our competitive advantages and long-term strategy. Our circular and low carbon solutions business is driving leadership in circularity and addressing the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. In the third pillar, we are transforming the culture of LYB to embed a more comprehensive view of value creation, while continuing to recognize that stringent cost management is vital in our industry. On Slide six, we highlight our progress on our strategy in 2023 and the work underway over the next few years towards over 2027 goals. In just 10 months, since launching our strategy last March, LyondellBasell has unlocked nearly 1/3 of the $3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA that we are targeting for 2027. The successful startup of the PO/TBA plant this year is a major step forward in growing and upgrading our core by adding approximately $450 million to our normalized EBITDA. And I'm very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is far exceeding our initial expectations. In 2023, the VEP achieved a year end run rate of more than $400 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvements, Michael will share more details on the progress of the VEP in a few moments. As shown on the slide, we have numerous workstreams underway to build towards our strategic goals of $2 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA by 2025, and a total of $3 billion by 2027. With the announced sale of the ethylene oxide and derivatives business to Ineos for $700 million, we are redirecting resources away from non-core businesses. The deal we announced in January to acquire 35% of NATPET in Saudi Arabia for approximately $500 million is just one example of how we are growing our core cost advantaged olefins, and polyolefins businesses. We're making great strides and building strong foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business. In 2023, we took a final investment decision for our first tranche of advanced recycling capacity in Germany, using our proprietary catalytic MoReTec technology. And we are building partnerships to source waste plastic to supply our app in Germany, while also securing waste plastic in Houston to supply our next investment an advanced recycling capacity. And the VEP program is not a one-time initiative, Michael will describe our increased targets for 2024 and beyond. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I want to congratulate our team on the substantial progress we achieved on our strategic journey in 2023, ensuring a robust platform for longer term value creation and positive leverage to any market turnarounds. On Slide seven, let's take a look at the steps ahead to deliver on our goals. We will continue to grow and upgrade our core businesses by focusing on advantaged feedstocks in growing markets, where LYB can build or extend our leading market position. Our new joint venture in Saudi Arabia is one example of how we will do this. As we add new positions, we will continue to review our portfolio for businesses and assets that are not aligned with our long-term strategy. The divestiture of EO and derivatives business, the sale of our Australian polypropylene business. The shutdown of a polypropylene line in Italy and the exit of the refining business for all examples of how we are sharpening the focus of our business portfolio. The rapid progress of the LYB value enhancement program also contributes to our growth through low-cost capacity debottlenecks and productivity improvements. We're making good progress on building the foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business as we work towards our goal of $500 million of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030. And our VEP is not only delivering growth and productivity, the VEP also supports the third pillar of our strategy to step up performance and culture by instilling a value-based mindset across the company. With numerous initiatives to improve margins through customer and commercial excellence embedded in the VEP. And our work is to transform our advance polymer solutions business is also an important part of our work to step up performance and culture. All of our progress is supported by our foundations of efficient cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and our investment grade balance sheet. We're leveraging partnerships where it fits to achieve growth with capital efficiency. And we're pursuing a very value focused investment program. And we remain steadfast in our support for a secure, competitive and growing dividends as part of our commitment to competitive shareholder returns. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael to discuss the details of our financial progress.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide eight and let's take a look at the progress of our value enhancement program. As Peter mentioned, LYBs value enhancement program far exceeded our initial expectations in 2023. When we launched the program, we thought we could achieve a 2023 year-end run rate of $150 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvement. With high engagement and rapid execution, our team achieved a run rate of more than $400 million by year-end 2023. We have a strong management system in place for our VEP program. Our team has screened more than 13,000 ideas, and more than 1900 of these ideas have advanced to the execution ready stage of our process. By the end of 2023, we executed on approximately 450 of these initiatives. Our system is robust and disciplined, and our internal and external auditors have validated our processes. We currently believe this effort will add a total of $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 and up to a billion dollars by the end of 2025. This is a significant increase from our initial target of $750 million that we announced last March, driven by the enthusiastic [indiscernible] of our colleagues and the tangible results that we have delivered so far. The LYV value enhancement program is providing meaningful contributions to our strategic financial goals. And we'll continue to do so as we move forward. On Slide nine, let me share more details about the progress on our VEP program during 2023. Our targets for the program are described as year-end run rates relative to 2021 volumes, and using average margins from 2017 to 2019, a time period that provides a good approximation of mid cycle margins. Through more than 450 initiatives, we generated over $300 million of VEP EBITDA from the program based on 2023 margins. This reflects the net recurring improvements throughout the year relative to 2021 volume, product mix and cost. Now, let me highlight a few of the initiatives from last year. At our Lake Charles integrated polyethylene joint venture, we automated controls for a water treatment unit that reduced manual operations and water consumption. With a small investment, we were able to reduce our LYB share of cost by $800,000 annually. In our oxy fuels business, our cost advantaged U.S. production is exported in vessels to markets around the world. We worked with one of our terminal providers to encourage their investment in a vapor recovery system that allowed LYB to double decile loading rates to reduce demerge cost and vapor emissions for a net recurring benefit of $1 million per year. By investing resources to learn more about the needs of our customers, our polymer product development team allocated resources for new products to serve demanding applications and wired cable sheathing for subsea infrastructure markets. This initiative improved recording profitability by at least $300,000 per year. We hope these examples provides you some insight into the hundreds of small initiatives that we have that we expect to add up to $1 billion of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA to LYBs run rate by the end of 2025. Please turn to Slide 10. And let me begin by highlighting the outstanding Cash Generation from our business portfolio during 2023. LYB generated a total of $4.9 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Cash on hand increased to $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2023, we achieved cash conversion of 98% well above our long-term target of 80%. Our cash conversion was bolstered by working capital reduction of approximately $700 million during the fourth quarter. The majority of the working capital benefit was from lower receivables and inventories. We expect our working capital needs will increase during the first quarter. Our efficient cash generation allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2023. This represents 53% of our $3.4 billion of free cash flow for the year. Let's continue with Slide 11 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. As Peter mentioned, we are committed to discipline capital allocation as we execute our strategy and maintain our robust investment grade balance sheet. During 2023 cash from operating activities fully funded $1.6 billion in dividends $210 million in share repurchases and our capital investment program. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, marking the 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. This year, we invested 1.5 billion in capital expenditures. We reached an important milestone with the successful startup of our new PO/TBA asset in 2023. With the completion of this world scale project, our future capital expenditures will be increasingly focused on a portfolio of smaller projects to advance our strategy. This includes investments in small profit generating projects, integrated hubs for circular solutions, and hundreds of initiatives within the value enhancement program. We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, then $7.6 billion of cash and available liquidity. In line with our strategic focus on leadership and sustainability. We issued our initial inaugural green bond for $500 million LYBs robust balance sheet positions as well to move forward on our long term strategy during the year ahead. One last comment. We added over a billion dollars of cash to our balance sheet in 2023 as a result of strong execution amid challenging market conditions. As a result, we are carrying about two times our stated minimum of 1.5 billion. We have built a bit more cash because of the challenging market conditions and uncertain economic outlook that we have been navigating. That said our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. And we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term. Now I would like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Page 12. LYBs business portfolio delivered $910 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our lower results reflect a significant decline in gasoline crack spreads in seasonally lower demand during the fourth quarter. Lower gasoline cracks bedspreads negatively impacted our refining results oxy fuels in the intermediates and Driftwood segment and the value of coproduct fuels and olefins and polyolefins Americas. During the quarter, lower ethane in energy cost and increased polyethylene exports benefitted our O&P Americas business. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remained soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low. Lower demand and higher raw material costs negatively impacted our advanced polymer solution segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pre tax for quarter results by approximately $55 million. As a reminder, the LIFO impact reflects changes in inventory valuation over the full year and it's not necessarily limited to fourth quarter valuations. Before we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditure plans for 2024, our capital plan includes approximately $800 billion for profit generating growth projects, and $1.3 billion of sustaining investment to keep our assets running safely and reliably. The increased profit generating capital includes investments to grow our circular and low carbon solutions business, as well as investments to lower the carbon footprint of our existing asset base, particularly in Europe. Funding required to drive our value enhancement program is included in our CapEx plan. We expect our 2024 effective tax rate will be approximately 20%. And our cash tax rate will be a few percentage points higher. In the appendix of the slide deck, we have provided additional 2024 modeling information, including impacts for major plant maintenance costs associated with the exit from our refining business than other useful financial metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\nKen Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Americas segments. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $604 million. During the quarter a significant decrease in co-product values negatively impacted olefin's margins. Polyolefins prices were stable domestically, while a very strong export volume led to some lower pricing in our overall portfolio. Strong demand from export markets continues to drive increased polyethylene volumes, and we didn't see the typical seasonal slowdown. We operated our assets at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity to match market demand and continued to actively manage working capital. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $75 million. During the first quarter, we expect polyethylene prices to remain firm with modest improvements in domestic demand and ongoing strength in export markets. We anticipate ethane and energy costs will remain favorable for our assets in the region, providing some margin tailwinds. Overall, we expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter, slightly lower than fourth quarter 2023 due to plant maintenance. In December, we signed two new renewable power purchase agreements. With these agreements, we've achieved almost 90% of our goal to procure at least 50% of our global power from renewable sources by 2030. In total, we have 12 agreements in place, representing more than 1.3 gigawatts of renewable power capacity. As we mentioned, last quarter, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture with Agilyx and ExxonMobi. This partnership is focused on increasing plastic waste, recycling infrastructure to improve circularity. In December Cyclyx announced the final investment decision to build the first Cyclyx circularity center in Houston. The circularity center will focus on increasing plastic waste recycling options, through better sourcing and sorting of plastic waste. The facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons of plastic feedstock per year for advanced and mechanical recycling and is expected to start off in 2025. Now, please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins. Europe, Asia and international segment. During the quarter, European markets remained weak with softer seasonal demand and lower consumer confidence. Polymer prices were modestly higher with an improved sales mix and stable naphtha feedstock costs. Due to the low demand, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 65% during the quarter. The combined impact of the weak demand and low rates lead to a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $87 million. As we move into 2024, we expect weak European demand will persist with ongoing consumer uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are seeing modest improvements in orders as some customers begin to restock and seek local supply as imports moving through the Red Sea are disrupted. We expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter. Demand in China remains muted as customers manage inventories with the approach of the lunar new year amid a slow economic environment. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our recent announcement to acquire a 35% share of naphtha reflects our focus on assets that have long-term advantage. But we're also moving away from the assets that can't deliver long-term competitiveness, as demonstrated by last year's decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We're also making good progress with building our circular and low carbon business. During the fourth quarter, we made the final investment decision to build our first commercial catalytic advanced recycling plant at our Wesseling Germany site. With an estimated capacity of 50,000 tons per year this plant will utilize our differential MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And just like in Houston, we are collaborating with partners to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany. In December, we acquired a minority share of Source One plastics, a plastic waste sourcing company in Germany. Source One will provide the majority of the processed plastic waste feedstock to our new MoReTec assets. Through our integrated hub model, we are establishing an integrated circular value chain at scale. Now please turn to Slide 15. And let's take a closer look at our new NATPET joint venture. A few weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire a 35% share of national petrochemical industrial company or where NATPET from Alujain Corporation and Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The joint venture is a great example of how we are growing our core businesses with advantage of the assets by leveraging LYBs leading technology and global market reach. Today, NATPET consists of 400,000 tons of propane dehydrogenation or PDH capacity that converts cost advantage Saudi propane into propylene monomer to feed a 400,000 ton polypropylene unit utilizing LYBs proprietary Spheripol technology. The assets have been operational since 2009 and have generated an annual average of U.S.$155 million in EBITDA over the five years from 2018 to 2022. NATPETs PP products serve a diverse range of customers across global markets. As part of the transaction, LYB will leverage our global marketing network to sell a majority of the product on behalf of net pet creating a new revenue stream for LYB. NATPETs assets are first quartile that have the advantage of sourcing local Saudi propane feedstock at a discount to global prices. Also our investment in NATPET provides a platform for continued growth. In 2022, NATPET was awarded a new feedstock allocation that could support additional capacity. The partners are evaluating a second PDH PP asset on the site that would benefit from meaningful synergies. Previously, Alujain selected LYB sphere zone polypropylene technology for the potential expansion. The high-performance polypropylene solutions enabled by our proprietary sphere zone technology provides the potential to expand NATPETs production into new applications and markets. We expect our investment in NATPET will exceed our 12% target for unlevered internal rates of return. The additional capacity could provide even higher returns. We expect the transaction will close in the first half of 2024 following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim.\nKim Foley: Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16, as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $265 million. Oxyfuel margins declined due to a significant decrease in gasoline CAC spreads as well as an increased supply of oxyfuels after industry downtime during the third quarter. Direct margins were pressured due to higher benzene feedstock costs, LIFO inventory charges were approximately $95 million. In the fourth quarter we recognized an impairment of $192 million related to our PO/SM joint venture in the Netherlands. We operated our assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter due to low demand as well as planned and unplanned downtime across most businesses. As we begin the first quarter oxyfuel margins remain similar to fourth quarter levels. We anticipate higher volumes across the segment after downtime in the fourth quarter and plan to operate across the IMD segment at approximately 75% in the first quarter. These operating rates reflect the impact of the recent winter freeze event, resulting in unplanned downtime at our U.S. Gulf Coast assets. In December, we announced an agreement to divest our ethylene oxide and derivative business to Ineos for $700 million. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are taking decisive actions to grow and upgrade that businesses and assets that align with our long-term strategy. While exiting businesses where LYB does not have a path to a leading position. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter following regulatory approvals, and other closing conditions. Please note that the agreed transaction price is pre-tax, and that these assets are heavily depreciated. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $51 million, including charges of $40 million of LIFO inventory valuation refining margins compressed due to lower gasoline crack spreads. During the quarter we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity due to planned and unplanned downtime, with an average crude rate of 230,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect gasoline crack spreads will improve offset by lower distillate cracks. We plan to operate the refinery directionally 80% of capacity in the first quarter, including a planned Coker outage with an estimated EBITDA impact of $50 million. Our team remains highly focused on safe and reliable operations as we continue to run our refining assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on slide 18. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $12 million. Margins were pressured by higher raw material cost and volumes decreased due to seasonally lower fourth quarter demand with a slowdown in December due to customer outages. Likely inventory valuations benefits were $10 million. Looking ahead, we see signs of market recovery and expect modest demand improvement in the first quarter. This year, we continued our transformation journey with advanced polymer solutions. APS results in 2023 were lower than 2022 and not reflected of our financial expectations for this business. Success with APS customers is largely based on project-by-project qualification. Today's underperformance is indicative of our low success rate in gaining new qualifications during prior quarters. However, our laser focus on our customers is gaining momentum. We have seen a step up in our recent surveys for customer satisfaction. With an organization that is focused and accountable. We're making steady progress as we rebuild our project growth funnel. Our growth pipeline is already delivering. During the fourth quarter of 2023, volumes improved by 2.5% over the prior year. I want to congratulate the APS team for achieving record safety performance in 2023. I truly believe our customer focus, as measured by our recent customer satisfaction survey, our progress in refilling our growth funnel and our superior safety results reflects our attention to detail that provides a leading indicator for operational performance and eventual financial results. With that, I will return the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire LyondellBasell team for delivering such resilient results during a very challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, licensing revenue moderated after exceptionally strong results in the third quarter due to the timing of licensing milestones. Nonetheless, EBITDA for the segment exceeded the fourth quarter of the prior year. Fourth quarter catalyst volumes were higher than any quarter since the third quarter of 2022. First quarter results for the technology segments were expected to improve due to increased licensing revenue and a further rise in catalyst volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. As Ken mentioned earlier, we will utilize our proprietary MoReTec technology as we build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. I'm very proud of the work our R&D team embarked on years ago to develop this differential and advantage technology from lab to commercial scale. Let me now summarize our outlook with Slide 20. As we begin 2024, the majority of our businesses are continuing to face the slow demand seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. But we are seeing a few early signs of improvement. Our North American O&P business is seeing modest demand improvements. In Europe, order trends were improving from a very low level as our O&P customers begin to pursue modest restocking. For the year, we expect normal seasonal demand improvements to begin near the end of the first quarter and continue through the summer. As we progress through the second half of the year, we expect demand to benefit from moderating interest rates and reduced inflation. Durable goods are a critical market for LYBs products. Demand for durable goods lacked the economy during 2022 and 2023. As markets digested the extraordinary high levels of consumer activity that prevailed during pandemic era stimulus. We expect that moderating interest rates, reduced inflation and infrastructure-related stimulus spending will begin to support a gradual return to a healthier demand for durable goods during the second half of this year. China is the largest market for chemicals, exceeding North America and Europe combined, and we continue to watch closely for targeted stimulus and other measures that could drive improved economic growth in China. In the meantime, LYB will continue to advance on our strategic goals. We are actively managing our portfolio to grow and upgrade our core businesses. We will continue to see actions supporting the growth of regional hubs that will serve as the engines for our profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And our work to embed value creation into our corporate culture will continue to deliver results through our value enhancement program. We're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Stephen Richardson with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Richardson: Peter, I was wondering if you could just dig in a little bit on the expectations for the second half and maybe just a little bit more on the O&P businesses. What kind of recovery are you kind of underwriting in your outlook? And how do you think that plays out and any guideposts beyond the statements on durables we should be thinking about as the year progresses?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Stephen. As usual, very good question from your side. To start with, as we alluded to, I mean, we're still a bit prudent on the guidance for Q1. But when we are looking at the second half of this year, a couple of things that I want to point to. This has been the longest downturn that we have seen as far as I can look back in our history. So one would expect I mean that there will be, if you look at inflation rates going down, interest rates going down, more consumer confidence in Europe maybe also in China, that demand would go up. So from a demand side, one would expect that demand would go up. And that covers not only the O&P business, but also if you look at durable groups, especially. As we all know, demand has been very low last year in durable goods, which, of course, has a lot to do with very high interest rates and therefore, consumer behavior so also, you would expect that durable goods demand would go up, I mean, especially in the second half of this year. The United States, as you know, has been quite robust. We have been able to navigate. You see robust margins also on the polyethylene side. And also here, as you know, inflation rates are going down. You see already a little bit of indications. There is more house builds, houses [indiscernible] that are being sold. And that, of course, has a direct impact on demand for durable goods.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Sorry about that. Pardon me, I was on mute sorry about that. Just regarding the napped joint venture, it seems like it's roughly 10x EBITDA, is that roughly right? And do you see potential for this investment to generate a higher EBITDA down the road? And I just wondering the basis for that investment, given it seems like polypropylene bit oversupplied. And I guess my other question on it would be what are the contract terms for the propane that you get from Saudi, any risk that price could get escalated down the road.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Steve. Also a good question on NATPET. First of all, I mean, we are very pleased that we were able to sign this deal that has been work of a core team in our company where I was personally, of course, deeply involved during quite an important period of time to come to this conclusion. When you look at the amount of money that we paid and Ken alluded to that in his remarks, then one cannot just look at the EBITDA, mid-cycle EBITDA to $150 million for the entire company. But what you don't see and what needs to take into consideration is the fact that we are the path to market, so we are generating value for the company that comes out of selling the products outside of Saudi Arabia to our other markets. And therefore, also strategically very important because we have a very sustainable low-cost feedstock basis that we have negotiated that is included in the deal so that we are better positioned in Polypropylene to go to certain markets where maybe today, we don't have the best position. And here, let's not forget that we did close '19 at our Brindisi assets in Italy as well. In addition to that, as we alluded to, we have the income streams generated out of our license agreements. We have the opportunity to continue to invest with the second line next to the existing lines to capture synergies there. And that's why Ken alluded to the fact that with the current deal, we are in iron ore, which is above 12%. But then as we do the second step, then we would be higher to say, I mean, quite higher than 12% or no final investment decision yet, but it is also part of the consideration in doing that first.\nMichael McMurray: Steve, in the multiple is probably closer to 9 versus 10 just for clarity.\nPeter Vanacker: Without taking into consideration, I mean, marketing fees, et cetera, et cetera.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Cunningham: Maybe within the $800 million in growth CapEx allocated for this year, how much of that is directly related to circular and low-carbon solutions? And beyond that, what should we expect in terms of inorganic growth and additional investments in that space for 2024?\nPeter Vanacker: I will just refer to the Capital Markets Day, we said about 15% over the cycle. Michael, do you want to add something to that, for next year?\nMichael McMurray: Yes. I mean what I'd say is that the guidance that we gave at Capital Markets Day for CapEx remains intact. As a reminder, we said over the period, '23 to '25 on average, we'd spend $2 billion. We guided to $2.1 billion today. And as Peter said, the expectation for the CLC SR circularity business it's about 15% to 20% over the period. Now specifically around inorganic growth. I'd probably say a couple of things. I think at our Capital Markets Day, we were clear that we hope to get some M&A done over the next few years. I think we were pretty clear the criteria that we shared in regards to growing and upgrading the core. I think the Sasol joint venture, our new PO/TBA facility, the circularity investments that we've made and the refining exit are all great examples and then our recent announcement of our EO and D exit is another great example. And quite frankly, it was a great valuation with the best owner mindset. We also shared our approach to growth through M&As and joint ventures at our Capital Markets Day. And I think with our Damped acquisition, we're off to a great start, and this clearly fits the framework, which we shared back in March. And then, it also has a great opportunity for future attractive growth. And then finally, at our March Capital Markets Day, we shared our goal of getting to $10 billion of EBITDA normalized EBITDA in 2027, which assumed we would deploy roughly the remaining 30% of our free cash flow that we haven't returned to investors to fund our future M&A ambitions. But I want to be clear about a couple of things. Our commitments to investors remain steadfast and our capital allocation principles and priorities remain unchanged. We will be disciplined acquirers we will not burn it in your cash. We will not build a lazy balance sheet. If we can't find compelling transactions, we'll give back more of your cash to you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Just in IND, how much of the PO/TBA plant contributed in 2023? Do you think mid-cycle earnings power here is still with the new CBA plant above $2 billion. And when do you think you'll start achieving a run rating at that mid-cycle earnings level? Thank you.\nPeter Vanacker: Happy birthday, Dave. We heard that you have your birthday today. Good question. If I take 1 step back on the I&D business in Q4, maybe a couple of numbers and stay with me so $265 million, excluding identified items is the EBITDA that we generated in Q4. But one needs to take into consideration, of course, that we had a heavy LIFO impact of $95 million. So if I add the LIFO impact of $95 million, then exit the underlying results were $360 million for Q4 comparing to Q4 2022 which was $291 million. So a quite underlying performance, good quarter in IND and I did not even take into consideration the fact that we had scheduled turnarounds bottleneck as well as in Bayport. So we alluded to that, in our guidance at the time when we released the Q3 results of an impact of about $120 million. So we laying quite a good quarter in IND. And of course, part of that was also due to the fact that we very successfully started up our PO/TBA plant. The new PO/TBA plant, we alluded to mid-cycle margins, $450 million. We said last year in year one. So that means 2023. We would run at a minimum of 50% nameplate capacity. We overachieved that target. We ran at approximately a little bit more than 60%, I would say. And then, also when we look at this year, we will continue to ramp up, and we will do it in a very disciplined way, reflecting on market demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. But one may see further progress, I would say, probably going to 70%, maybe exceeding 70% capacity utilization. And then when we move into 2025, that's where one would see the full benefit of the PO/TBA plant in terms of capacity utilization.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Just on the value enhancement program. I'm just trying to understand the impact to '23 and '24, a bit better. If we just sort of kind of look at a ratio of sort of what that 2017 to 2019 EBITDA was at Lyondell then versus what it was in 2023. If we apply that ratio to the VEP numbers, would that be about right in terms of what you enjoyed from it in '23 and what you expect in '24?\nMichael McMurray: Yes. What I'd say, I mean, hopefully, you heard my prepared remarks, Vincent, so the benefit, the actual benefit in our P&L for 2023 was approximately $300 million. And then we guided for '24 for an exit run rate of $600 million. Now if you're trying to draw a line from '23 to '25, it looks like that kind of the pace of change slows a bit. But keep in mind that last year, we focused on low-hanging fruit, things that didn't require investment and that we could execute upon very quickly. So we're in kind of building up projects again as we sit in this year, but we have high confidence in the outlook that we gave up to $1 billion in 2025 and again, $300 million of P&L benefit in '23, actual.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Sison: Cheers, in terms of 2024 a lot of chemical companies you've reported thus far has sort of said their earnings could recover or be better in '24 versus '23. It sounds like your first half is going to be a little bit challenged with demand being weaker and the second half being a little bit better. So when you sort of total up potentially what you see in '24, should earnings be up, flat or down or just maybe directionally for the full year, how do you think about the setup for early?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, Michael, you said it yourself. I mean, Q1, still modest Q2 seasonal demands have been picking up. And then what I said at the beginning also second half of the year, we expect at least, that we will see interest rates going down demand for durable goods, I mean going up, some recovery in Europe, some recovery in China. So as a consequence, if you added all that, one would expect that earnings are going to be better than last year.\nMichael McMurray: But mostly in the second half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. I'm sorry. We'll go on to our next question, comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: In 2024, would you expect your regional mix of earnings to differ materially from 2023. Part of the reason I ask is it looks like you're guiding to a tax rate of 20% and often regional mix is the reason behind that, but perhaps there are other reasons you might call out. Maybe you could just kind of talk through the dynamics there would be helpful.\nMichael McMurray: Yes. I'm happy to talk through it. So yes, I mean, the ETR, we guided to of 20% is up roughly 1 percentage point versus what was in 2023. So not a huge story. There's a few give and takes. Now we did guide our cash tax rate to be up a couple of percentage points versus last year and also our ETR from 2023 and that's largely driven by a decrease in U.S. tax depreciation and also the gain on the sale of our EO&D business. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: Could we get an update on your China operations both in PO styrene and your polyolefins JVs?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes, John. Welcome back. Let me give that question to Ken. The opportunity?\nKen Lane: Yes, sure. I'll take a question for O&P and then maybe Kim, you can comment on IND. But for O&P, we continue to operate the joint venture at technical minimums. The focus really is on finding better product mix and customer mix in region. Our focus when we entered that joint venture was to build out an increased presence in the domestic market because we do market the high-density polyethylene and polypropylene from the asset. The team did a great job with that last year. So earnings, of course, are still very challenged in China. If you look at average margins, they're still slightly negative which we're seeing that in our asset. Even with a new world-scale asset, it still is a very challenging market, and we expect to start to see some improvement in that in the second half of the year. But so far, demand has been, I'd say, modestly improving, but haven't seen really an improvement in margins yet, Kim?\nKim Foley: I would say as it relates to the joint ventures we have on the propylene oxide guide. We ran both of those JVs above 95% operating rates last year, excluding a turnaround, which was significantly higher than other PO plants in that region. As Ken alluded to, the margins were rather thin. We saw high raw material costs, and we also saw high utilities. But as we've mentioned before, these are the best technologies that we have in the region. They are very cost competitive. They sit on integrated sites owned by a very good operator with expertise in both of these technologies. And we think as we go forward, we have huge potential here.\nPeter Vanacker: And may I add to that also, you probably noticed some news flow around China, phasing out chlorine-based propylene oxide technologies towards 2025. The majority of propylene oxide capacity in China that would be phased out for time which also fits for us very well together with our global strategy, the successful start-up of our PO/TBA plant. And we are running this business successfully under Kevin's leadership from a global basis.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Leithead: I wanted to add around O&P EAI, EBITDA has been below breakeven, I think 4 out of the last 6 quarters. And I appreciate demand isn't great across most markets. But it just seems like there's been a bit of a shift here versus the profitability in the past decade. So do we need to take a bigger restructuring overhaul to make this business profitable again? Do we need to wait for the world to get better? I mean just how are you approaching that business here in '24?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, Mike. A very good question. And you've seen from our actions already last year that we are turning around every stone. We did shut down one line in Brindisi, which is an important capacity. We've seen that there has been a couple of other announcements in the marketplace in terms of consolidations. We continue to look, of course, at the entire portfolio. That's what you would expect us to do. But having said that, I also reflect back on Q4. So in a big picture on for the company for us, was towards the end of the year, we wanted to also optimize our cash flow and working capital. And we freed up about $700 million in working capital in that Q4. And as a consequence, of course, also can see this business towards lower than what we had originally guided to. 75% of capacity utilization was the guidance. We reduced at really surprisingly low levels 65% of our capacity utilization. Again, in the context of also with the current market environment, optimizing our working capital. Anything you want to add?\nKen Lane: No, that's it. I mean that just impacted the P&L with the absorption of the fixed costs that go along with that. But we pulled hard on the working capital lever, and we're going to continue to stay focused on maximizing cash flow. Challenging environment.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. And we see the future also in Europe. You see also that regulation is progressing in terms of renewable and circular solutions which is actually also what we are focusing upon, I mean, with quite a lot of activities in terms of building [indiscernible], the final investment decision for our MoReTec-1 facility, but lots of joint ventures and feedstock cooperations that we have built up in the meantime. So that in Europe, I continue to believe that these circular and renewable solutions, they demand, local supply chains. So therefore, it will be very important to have such a leading position in a local market with the access to brand owners or EPS business, access to OEMs as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn McNulty: Just a follow-up on the NATPET joint venture. I guess, can you help us to understand in terms of the ability to upscale that with the additional allocation, is it similar in scale or size, would it be kind of the 400 KTA? And also, when you think about the timing of financial investment decision and also how the capital gets allocated? Is it going to be proportional is the same kind of 35%, 65% or is there some different variation to that? Can you help us to think about those?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes, the current capacity, as you rightfully said, is around, 400KT so with the other that Ken referred to. We would be able to scale up to in total capacity of 1 million tons. Again, we have 35% of the joint venture. So that 35% is valid for the current capacity, but we can also be valid for future capacity if we take a final investment decision. Ken some more information that you want to share?\nKen Lane: Yes, I'll just add that part of the synergy that you had talked about before is that region is short of propylene. And so we're going to have additional propylene capacity with this expansion, which is one of the synergies around potentially executing that. But it will be financed by the joint venture. And yes, it will be proportionate for the shareholders, but we don't expect to be putting cash in. That's going to be something financed by the joint venture.\nOperator: Our final question this morning comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Blair: Looking at the 70% payout target versus free cash flow just in the context of increasing CapEx when you're considering these payout targets, why is the denominator free cash and not more of like a cash from operations. Don't you need to balance these returns on the growth investments against returning cash to investors.\nMichael McMurray: Not sure I fully understand your question, but it's pretty typical when you're giving payout targets to give it on the free cash flow line versus operating cash flow.\nPeter Vanacker: And then we also, at the Capital Markets Day guided to words, that what is the CapEx level that we are investing so sustainable CapEx around. I mean that $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion a year. And then the growth CapEx, we also said we're going to be pretty much in the range of our historic spending somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion on a yearly basis depending on how these projects come. So I think that helps you, to do the back of the unloved calculation, whatever cash flow number you take.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for final comments.\nPeter Vanacker: Okay. Thank you, again, for all the excellent questions. And of course, I also want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding value and maximizing cash conversion during these challenging times. We look forward to sharing more updates over the coming months with further progress on our long-term strategy. We wish you all a great weekend and stay well, stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Let's begin as we always do, with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2023, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. LYBs total recordable injury rate was 0.14, which is approximately 20% lower than the average of the prior three years. I want to congratulate our APS segments where injuries were 38% lower than 2022, a significant improvement from historical levels. We always use safety performance as a leading indicator of operational excellence and business performance. But there is no greater value than seeing every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health has when they began to work their working day. So turn to Slide four to discuss our financial results. 2023 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. While energy prices moderated in an environment of geopolitical unrest, markets were extremely cautious due to uncertainty about inflation and the potential for a more pronounced downturn in economic activity. Reported GDP growth in U.S. and China improved relative to 2022, the growth in petrochemicals was far below norms for our industry. Against that backdrop, LYB delivered earnings of $8.65 per share with an EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Cash generation was exceptional, and resulted in $4.9 billion of cash from operations. We have a highly efficient cash conversion ratio of 98%. We ended the year with $7.6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment grade balance sheet. And we exceeded our cost of capital with an 11% return on invested capital. In March of last year, we successfully launched our new strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York. Now let's turn to Slide five and briefly review the strategy. Our goal was to create focus, clarity, and alignments about direction LyondellBasell would be moving over the next five years and provide a clear vision of what the company would look like in 2027. Our strategy is built around three pillars, growing and upgrading the core, building a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business and stepping up performance and culture. In growing and upgrading the core, we are investing in businesses that fit with our competitive advantages and long-term strategy. Our circular and low carbon solutions business is driving leadership in circularity and addressing the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. In the third pillar, we are transforming the culture of LYB to embed a more comprehensive view of value creation, while continuing to recognize that stringent cost management is vital in our industry. On Slide six, we highlight our progress on our strategy in 2023 and the work underway over the next few years towards over 2027 goals. In just 10 months, since launching our strategy last March, LyondellBasell has unlocked nearly 1/3 of the $3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA that we are targeting for 2027. The successful startup of the PO/TBA plant this year is a major step forward in growing and upgrading our core by adding approximately $450 million to our normalized EBITDA. And I'm very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is far exceeding our initial expectations. In 2023, the VEP achieved a year end run rate of more than $400 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvements, Michael will share more details on the progress of the VEP in a few moments. As shown on the slide, we have numerous workstreams underway to build towards our strategic goals of $2 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA by 2025, and a total of $3 billion by 2027. With the announced sale of the ethylene oxide and derivatives business to Ineos for $700 million, we are redirecting resources away from non-core businesses. The deal we announced in January to acquire 35% of NATPET in Saudi Arabia for approximately $500 million is just one example of how we are growing our core cost advantaged olefins, and polyolefins businesses. We're making great strides and building strong foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business. In 2023, we took a final investment decision for our first tranche of advanced recycling capacity in Germany, using our proprietary catalytic MoReTec technology. And we are building partnerships to source waste plastic to supply our app in Germany, while also securing waste plastic in Houston to supply our next investment an advanced recycling capacity. And the VEP program is not a one-time initiative, Michael will describe our increased targets for 2024 and beyond. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I want to congratulate our team on the substantial progress we achieved on our strategic journey in 2023, ensuring a robust platform for longer term value creation and positive leverage to any market turnarounds. On Slide seven, let's take a look at the steps ahead to deliver on our goals. We will continue to grow and upgrade our core businesses by focusing on advantaged feedstocks in growing markets, where LYB can build or extend our leading market position. Our new joint venture in Saudi Arabia is one example of how we will do this. As we add new positions, we will continue to review our portfolio for businesses and assets that are not aligned with our long-term strategy. The divestiture of EO and derivatives business, the sale of our Australian polypropylene business. The shutdown of a polypropylene line in Italy and the exit of the refining business for all examples of how we are sharpening the focus of our business portfolio. The rapid progress of the LYB value enhancement program also contributes to our growth through low-cost capacity debottlenecks and productivity improvements. We're making good progress on building the foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business as we work towards our goal of $500 million of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030. And our VEP is not only delivering growth and productivity, the VEP also supports the third pillar of our strategy to step up performance and culture by instilling a value-based mindset across the company. With numerous initiatives to improve margins through customer and commercial excellence embedded in the VEP. And our work is to transform our advance polymer solutions business is also an important part of our work to step up performance and culture. All of our progress is supported by our foundations of efficient cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and our investment grade balance sheet. We're leveraging partnerships where it fits to achieve growth with capital efficiency. And we're pursuing a very value focused investment program. And we remain steadfast in our support for a secure, competitive and growing dividends as part of our commitment to competitive shareholder returns. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael to discuss the details of our financial progress. Thanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire LyondellBasell team for delivering such resilient results during a very challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, licensing revenue moderated after exceptionally strong results in the third quarter due to the timing of licensing milestones. Nonetheless, EBITDA for the segment exceeded the fourth quarter of the prior year. Fourth quarter catalyst volumes were higher than any quarter since the third quarter of 2022. First quarter results for the technology segments were expected to improve due to increased licensing revenue and a further rise in catalyst volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. As Ken mentioned earlier, we will utilize our proprietary MoReTec technology as we build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. I'm very proud of the work our R&D team embarked on years ago to develop this differential and advantage technology from lab to commercial scale. Let me now summarize our outlook with Slide 20. As we begin 2024, the majority of our businesses are continuing to face the slow demand seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. But we are seeing a few early signs of improvement. Our North American O&P business is seeing modest demand improvements. In Europe, order trends were improving from a very low level as our O&P customers begin to pursue modest restocking. For the year, we expect normal seasonal demand improvements to begin near the end of the first quarter and continue through the summer. As we progress through the second half of the year, we expect demand to benefit from moderating interest rates and reduced inflation. Durable goods are a critical market for LYBs products. Demand for durable goods lacked the economy during 2022 and 2023. As markets digested the extraordinary high levels of consumer activity that prevailed during pandemic era stimulus. We expect that moderating interest rates, reduced inflation and infrastructure-related stimulus spending will begin to support a gradual return to a healthier demand for durable goods during the second half of this year. China is the largest market for chemicals, exceeding North America and Europe combined, and we continue to watch closely for targeted stimulus and other measures that could drive improved economic growth in China. In the meantime, LYB will continue to advance on our strategic goals. We are actively managing our portfolio to grow and upgrade our core businesses. We will continue to see actions supporting the growth of regional hubs that will serve as the engines for our profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And our work to embed value creation into our corporate culture will continue to deliver results through our value enhancement program. We're now pleased to take your questions. Thank you, Stephen. As usual, very good question from your side. To start with, as we alluded to, I mean, we're still a bit prudent on the guidance for Q1. But when we are looking at the second half of this year, a couple of things that I want to point to. This has been the longest downturn that we have seen as far as I can look back in our history. So one would expect I mean that there will be, if you look at inflation rates going down, interest rates going down, more consumer confidence in Europe maybe also in China, that demand would go up. So from a demand side, one would expect that demand would go up. And that covers not only the O&P business, but also if you look at durable groups, especially. As we all know, demand has been very low last year in durable goods, which, of course, has a lot to do with very high interest rates and therefore, consumer behavior so also, you would expect that durable goods demand would go up, I mean, especially in the second half of this year. The United States, as you know, has been quite robust. We have been able to navigate. You see robust margins also on the polyethylene side. And also here, as you know, inflation rates are going down. You see already a little bit of indications. There is more house builds, houses [indiscernible] that are being sold. And that, of course, has a direct impact on demand for durable goods. Thank you, Steve. Also a good question on NATPET. First of all, I mean, we are very pleased that we were able to sign this deal that has been work of a core team in our company where I was personally, of course, deeply involved during quite an important period of time to come to this conclusion. When you look at the amount of money that we paid and Ken alluded to that in his remarks, then one cannot just look at the EBITDA, mid-cycle EBITDA to $150 million for the entire company. But what you don't see and what needs to take into consideration is the fact that we are the path to market, so we are generating value for the company that comes out of selling the products outside of Saudi Arabia to our other markets. And therefore, also strategically very important because we have a very sustainable low-cost feedstock basis that we have negotiated that is included in the deal so that we are better positioned in Polypropylene to go to certain markets where maybe today, we don't have the best position. And here, let's not forget that we did close '19 at our Brindisi assets in Italy as well. In addition to that, as we alluded to, we have the income streams generated out of our license agreements. We have the opportunity to continue to invest with the second line next to the existing lines to capture synergies there. And that's why Ken alluded to the fact that with the current deal, we are in iron ore, which is above 12%. But then as we do the second step, then we would be higher to say, I mean, quite higher than 12% or no final investment decision yet, but it is also part of the consideration in doing that first. Without taking into consideration, I mean, marketing fees, et cetera, et cetera. I will just refer to the Capital Markets Day, we said about 15% over the cycle. Michael, do you want to add something to that, for next year? Happy birthday, Dave. We heard that you have your birthday today. Good question. If I take 1 step back on the I&D business in Q4, maybe a couple of numbers and stay with me so $265 million, excluding identified items is the EBITDA that we generated in Q4. But one needs to take into consideration, of course, that we had a heavy LIFO impact of $95 million. So if I add the LIFO impact of $95 million, then exit the underlying results were $360 million for Q4 comparing to Q4 2022 which was $291 million. So a quite underlying performance, good quarter in IND and I did not even take into consideration the fact that we had scheduled turnarounds bottleneck as well as in Bayport. So we alluded to that, in our guidance at the time when we released the Q3 results of an impact of about $120 million. So we laying quite a good quarter in IND. And of course, part of that was also due to the fact that we very successfully started up our PO/TBA plant. The new PO/TBA plant, we alluded to mid-cycle margins, $450 million. We said last year in year one. So that means 2023. We would run at a minimum of 50% nameplate capacity. We overachieved that target. We ran at approximately a little bit more than 60%, I would say. And then, also when we look at this year, we will continue to ramp up, and we will do it in a very disciplined way, reflecting on market demand for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. But one may see further progress, I would say, probably going to 70%, maybe exceeding 70% capacity utilization. And then when we move into 2025, that's where one would see the full benefit of the PO/TBA plant in terms of capacity utilization. Well, Michael, you said it yourself. I mean, Q1, still modest Q2 seasonal demands have been picking up. And then what I said at the beginning also second half of the year, we expect at least, that we will see interest rates going down demand for durable goods, I mean going up, some recovery in Europe, some recovery in China. So as a consequence, if you added all that, one would expect that earnings are going to be better than last year. Yes, John. Welcome back. Let me give that question to Ken. The opportunity? And may I add to that also, you probably noticed some news flow around China, phasing out chlorine-based propylene oxide technologies towards 2025. The majority of propylene oxide capacity in China that would be phased out for time which also fits for us very well together with our global strategy, the successful start-up of our PO/TBA plant. And we are running this business successfully under Kevin's leadership from a global basis. Yes. Thank you, Mike. A very good question. And you've seen from our actions already last year that we are turning around every stone. We did shut down one line in Brindisi, which is an important capacity. We've seen that there has been a couple of other announcements in the marketplace in terms of consolidations. We continue to look, of course, at the entire portfolio. That's what you would expect us to do. But having said that, I also reflect back on Q4. So in a big picture on for the company for us, was towards the end of the year, we wanted to also optimize our cash flow and working capital. And we freed up about $700 million in working capital in that Q4. And as a consequence, of course, also can see this business towards lower than what we had originally guided to. 75% of capacity utilization was the guidance. We reduced at really surprisingly low levels 65% of our capacity utilization. Again, in the context of also with the current market environment, optimizing our working capital. Anything you want to add? Yes. And we see the future also in Europe. You see also that regulation is progressing in terms of renewable and circular solutions which is actually also what we are focusing upon, I mean, with quite a lot of activities in terms of building [indiscernible], the final investment decision for our MoReTec-1 facility, but lots of joint ventures and feedstock cooperations that we have built up in the meantime. So that in Europe, I continue to believe that these circular and renewable solutions, they demand, local supply chains. So therefore, it will be very important to have such a leading position in a local market with the access to brand owners or EPS business, access to OEMs as well. Yes, the current capacity, as you rightfully said, is around, 400KT so with the other that Ken referred to. We would be able to scale up to in total capacity of 1 million tons. Again, we have 35% of the joint venture. So that 35% is valid for the current capacity, but we can also be valid for future capacity if we take a final investment decision. Ken some more information that you want to share? And then we also, at the Capital Markets Day guided to words, that what is the CapEx level that we are investing so sustainable CapEx around. I mean that $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion a year. And then the growth CapEx, we also said we're going to be pretty much in the range of our historic spending somewhere between $2 billion and $3 billion on a yearly basis depending on how these projects come. So I think that helps you, to do the back of the unloved calculation, whatever cash flow number you take. Okay. Thank you, again, for all the excellent questions. And of course, I also want to thank our global team for delivering outstanding value and maximizing cash conversion during these challenging times. We look forward to sharing more updates over the coming months with further progress on our long-term strategy. We wish you all a great weekend and stay well, stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide eight and let's take a look at the progress of our value enhancement program. As Peter mentioned, LYBs value enhancement program far exceeded our initial expectations in 2023. When we launched the program, we thought we could achieve a 2023 year-end run rate of $150 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvement. With high engagement and rapid execution, our team achieved a run rate of more than $400 million by year-end 2023. We have a strong management system in place for our VEP program. Our team has screened more than 13,000 ideas, and more than 1900 of these ideas have advanced to the execution ready stage of our process. By the end of 2023, we executed on approximately 450 of these initiatives. Our system is robust and disciplined, and our internal and external auditors have validated our processes. We currently believe this effort will add a total of $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 and up to a billion dollars by the end of 2025. This is a significant increase from our initial target of $750 million that we announced last March, driven by the enthusiastic [indiscernible] of our colleagues and the tangible results that we have delivered so far. The LYV value enhancement program is providing meaningful contributions to our strategic financial goals. And we'll continue to do so as we move forward. On Slide nine, let me share more details about the progress on our VEP program during 2023. Our targets for the program are described as year-end run rates relative to 2021 volumes, and using average margins from 2017 to 2019, a time period that provides a good approximation of mid cycle margins. Through more than 450 initiatives, we generated over $300 million of VEP EBITDA from the program based on 2023 margins. This reflects the net recurring improvements throughout the year relative to 2021 volume, product mix and cost. Now, let me highlight a few of the initiatives from last year. At our Lake Charles integrated polyethylene joint venture, we automated controls for a water treatment unit that reduced manual operations and water consumption. With a small investment, we were able to reduce our LYB share of cost by $800,000 annually. In our oxy fuels business, our cost advantaged U.S. production is exported in vessels to markets around the world. We worked with one of our terminal providers to encourage their investment in a vapor recovery system that allowed LYB to double decile loading rates to reduce demerge cost and vapor emissions for a net recurring benefit of $1 million per year. By investing resources to learn more about the needs of our customers, our polymer product development team allocated resources for new products to serve demanding applications and wired cable sheathing for subsea infrastructure markets. This initiative improved recording profitability by at least $300,000 per year. We hope these examples provides you some insight into the hundreds of small initiatives that we have that we expect to add up to $1 billion of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA to LYBs run rate by the end of 2025. Please turn to Slide 10. And let me begin by highlighting the outstanding Cash Generation from our business portfolio during 2023. LYB generated a total of $4.9 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year. Cash on hand increased to $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2023, we achieved cash conversion of 98% well above our long-term target of 80%. Our cash conversion was bolstered by working capital reduction of approximately $700 million during the fourth quarter. The majority of the working capital benefit was from lower receivables and inventories. We expect our working capital needs will increase during the first quarter. Our efficient cash generation allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2023. This represents 53% of our $3.4 billion of free cash flow for the year. Let's continue with Slide 11 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. As Peter mentioned, we are committed to discipline capital allocation as we execute our strategy and maintain our robust investment grade balance sheet. During 2023 cash from operating activities fully funded $1.6 billion in dividends $210 million in share repurchases and our capital investment program. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, marking the 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. This year, we invested 1.5 billion in capital expenditures. We reached an important milestone with the successful startup of our new PO/TBA asset in 2023. With the completion of this world scale project, our future capital expenditures will be increasingly focused on a portfolio of smaller projects to advance our strategy. This includes investments in small profit generating projects, integrated hubs for circular solutions, and hundreds of initiatives within the value enhancement program. We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, then $7.6 billion of cash and available liquidity. In line with our strategic focus on leadership and sustainability. We issued our initial inaugural green bond for $500 million LYBs robust balance sheet positions as well to move forward on our long term strategy during the year ahead. One last comment. We added over a billion dollars of cash to our balance sheet in 2023 as a result of strong execution amid challenging market conditions. As a result, we are carrying about two times our stated minimum of 1.5 billion. We have built a bit more cash because of the challenging market conditions and uncertain economic outlook that we have been navigating. That said our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. And we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term. Now I would like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Page 12. LYBs business portfolio delivered $910 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our lower results reflect a significant decline in gasoline crack spreads in seasonally lower demand during the fourth quarter. Lower gasoline cracks bedspreads negatively impacted our refining results oxy fuels in the intermediates and Driftwood segment and the value of coproduct fuels and olefins and polyolefins Americas. During the quarter, lower ethane in energy cost and increased polyethylene exports benefitted our O&P Americas business. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remained soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low. Lower demand and higher raw material costs negatively impacted our advanced polymer solution segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pre tax for quarter results by approximately $55 million. As a reminder, the LIFO impact reflects changes in inventory valuation over the full year and it's not necessarily limited to fourth quarter valuations. Before we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditure plans for 2024, our capital plan includes approximately $800 billion for profit generating growth projects, and $1.3 billion of sustaining investment to keep our assets running safely and reliably. The increased profit generating capital includes investments to grow our circular and low carbon solutions business, as well as investments to lower the carbon footprint of our existing asset base, particularly in Europe. Funding required to drive our value enhancement program is included in our CapEx plan. We expect our 2024 effective tax rate will be approximately 20%. And our cash tax rate will be a few percentage points higher. In the appendix of the slide deck, we have provided additional 2024 modeling information, including impacts for major plant maintenance costs associated with the exit from our refining business than other useful financial metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? Steve, in the multiple is probably closer to 9 versus 10 just for clarity. Yes. I mean what I'd say is that the guidance that we gave at Capital Markets Day for CapEx remains intact. As a reminder, we said over the period, '23 to '25 on average, we'd spend $2 billion. We guided to $2.1 billion today. And as Peter said, the expectation for the CLC SR circularity business it's about 15% to 20% over the period. Now specifically around inorganic growth. I'd probably say a couple of things. I think at our Capital Markets Day, we were clear that we hope to get some M&A done over the next few years. I think we were pretty clear the criteria that we shared in regards to growing and upgrading the core. I think the Sasol joint venture, our new PO/TBA facility, the circularity investments that we've made and the refining exit are all great examples and then our recent announcement of our EO and D exit is another great example. And quite frankly, it was a great valuation with the best owner mindset. We also shared our approach to growth through M&As and joint ventures at our Capital Markets Day. And I think with our Damped acquisition, we're off to a great start, and this clearly fits the framework, which we shared back in March. And then, it also has a great opportunity for future attractive growth. And then finally, at our March Capital Markets Day, we shared our goal of getting to $10 billion of EBITDA normalized EBITDA in 2027, which assumed we would deploy roughly the remaining 30% of our free cash flow that we haven't returned to investors to fund our future M&A ambitions. But I want to be clear about a couple of things. Our commitments to investors remain steadfast and our capital allocation principles and priorities remain unchanged. We will be disciplined acquirers we will not burn it in your cash. We will not build a lazy balance sheet. If we can't find compelling transactions, we'll give back more of your cash to you. Yes. What I'd say, I mean, hopefully, you heard my prepared remarks, Vincent, so the benefit, the actual benefit in our P&L for 2023 was approximately $300 million. And then we guided for '24 for an exit run rate of $600 million. Now if you're trying to draw a line from '23 to '25, it looks like that kind of the pace of change slows a bit. But keep in mind that last year, we focused on low-hanging fruit, things that didn't require investment and that we could execute upon very quickly. So we're in kind of building up projects again as we sit in this year, but we have high confidence in the outlook that we gave up to $1 billion in 2025 and again, $300 million of P&L benefit in '23, actual. But mostly in the second half. Yes. I'm happy to talk through it. So yes, I mean, the ETR, we guided to of 20% is up roughly 1 percentage point versus what was in 2023. So not a huge story. There's a few give and takes. Now we did guide our cash tax rate to be up a couple of percentage points versus last year and also our ETR from 2023 and that's largely driven by a decrease in U.S. tax depreciation and also the gain on the sale of our EO&D business. Hopefully, that's helpful. Not sure I fully understand your question, but it's pretty typical when you're giving payout targets to give it on the free cash flow line versus operating cash flow."

            "name": "Kim Foley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16, as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $265 million. Oxyfuel margins declined due to a significant decrease in gasoline CAC spreads as well as an increased supply of oxyfuels after industry downtime during the third quarter. Direct margins were pressured due to higher benzene feedstock costs, LIFO inventory charges were approximately $95 million. In the fourth quarter we recognized an impairment of $192 million related to our PO/SM joint venture in the Netherlands. We operated our assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter due to low demand as well as planned and unplanned downtime across most businesses. As we begin the first quarter oxyfuel margins remain similar to fourth quarter levels. We anticipate higher volumes across the segment after downtime in the fourth quarter and plan to operate across the IMD segment at approximately 75% in the first quarter. These operating rates reflect the impact of the recent winter freeze event, resulting in unplanned downtime at our U.S. Gulf Coast assets. In December, we announced an agreement to divest our ethylene oxide and derivative business to Ineos for $700 million. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are taking decisive actions to grow and upgrade that businesses and assets that align with our long-term strategy. While exiting businesses where LYB does not have a path to a leading position. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter following regulatory approvals, and other closing conditions. Please note that the agreed transaction price is pre-tax, and that these assets are heavily depreciated. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $51 million, including charges of $40 million of LIFO inventory valuation refining margins compressed due to lower gasoline crack spreads. During the quarter we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity due to planned and unplanned downtime, with an average crude rate of 230,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect gasoline crack spreads will improve offset by lower distillate cracks. We plan to operate the refinery directionally 80% of capacity in the first quarter, including a planned Coker outage with an estimated EBITDA impact of $50 million. Our team remains highly focused on safe and reliable operations as we continue to run our refining assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. I would say as it relates to the joint ventures we have on the propylene oxide guide. We ran both of those JVs above 95% operating rates last year, excluding a turnaround, which was significantly higher than other PO plants in that region. As Ken alluded to, the margins were rather thin. We saw high raw material costs, and we also saw high utilities. But as we've mentioned before, these are the best technologies that we have in the region. They are very cost competitive. They sit on integrated sites owned by a very good operator with expertise in both of these technologies. And we think as we go forward, we have huge potential here."

            "name": "Ken Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Americas segments. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $604 million. During the quarter a significant decrease in co-product values negatively impacted olefin's margins. Polyolefins prices were stable domestically, while a very strong export volume led to some lower pricing in our overall portfolio. Strong demand from export markets continues to drive increased polyethylene volumes, and we didn't see the typical seasonal slowdown. We operated our assets at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity to match market demand and continued to actively manage working capital. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $75 million. During the first quarter, we expect polyethylene prices to remain firm with modest improvements in domestic demand and ongoing strength in export markets. We anticipate ethane and energy costs will remain favorable for our assets in the region, providing some margin tailwinds. Overall, we expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter, slightly lower than fourth quarter 2023 due to plant maintenance. In December, we signed two new renewable power purchase agreements. With these agreements, we've achieved almost 90% of our goal to procure at least 50% of our global power from renewable sources by 2030. In total, we have 12 agreements in place, representing more than 1.3 gigawatts of renewable power capacity. As we mentioned, last quarter, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture with Agilyx and ExxonMobi. This partnership is focused on increasing plastic waste, recycling infrastructure to improve circularity. In December Cyclyx announced the final investment decision to build the first Cyclyx circularity center in Houston. The circularity center will focus on increasing plastic waste recycling options, through better sourcing and sorting of plastic waste. The facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons of plastic feedstock per year for advanced and mechanical recycling and is expected to start off in 2025. Now, please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins. Europe, Asia and international segment. During the quarter, European markets remained weak with softer seasonal demand and lower consumer confidence. Polymer prices were modestly higher with an improved sales mix and stable naphtha feedstock costs. Due to the low demand, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 65% during the quarter. The combined impact of the weak demand and low rates lead to a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $87 million. As we move into 2024, we expect weak European demand will persist with ongoing consumer uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are seeing modest improvements in orders as some customers begin to restock and seek local supply as imports moving through the Red Sea are disrupted. We expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter. Demand in China remains muted as customers manage inventories with the approach of the lunar new year amid a slow economic environment. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our recent announcement to acquire a 35% share of naphtha reflects our focus on assets that have long-term advantage. But we're also moving away from the assets that can't deliver long-term competitiveness, as demonstrated by last year's decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We're also making good progress with building our circular and low carbon business. During the fourth quarter, we made the final investment decision to build our first commercial catalytic advanced recycling plant at our Wesseling Germany site. With an estimated capacity of 50,000 tons per year this plant will utilize our differential MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And just like in Houston, we are collaborating with partners to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany. In December, we acquired a minority share of Source One plastics, a plastic waste sourcing company in Germany. Source One will provide the majority of the processed plastic waste feedstock to our new MoReTec assets. Through our integrated hub model, we are establishing an integrated circular value chain at scale. Now please turn to Slide 15. And let's take a closer look at our new NATPET joint venture. A few weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire a 35% share of national petrochemical industrial company or where NATPET from Alujain Corporation and Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The joint venture is a great example of how we are growing our core businesses with advantage of the assets by leveraging LYBs leading technology and global market reach. Today, NATPET consists of 400,000 tons of propane dehydrogenation or PDH capacity that converts cost advantage Saudi propane into propylene monomer to feed a 400,000 ton polypropylene unit utilizing LYBs proprietary Spheripol technology. The assets have been operational since 2009 and have generated an annual average of U.S.$155 million in EBITDA over the five years from 2018 to 2022. NATPETs PP products serve a diverse range of customers across global markets. As part of the transaction, LYB will leverage our global marketing network to sell a majority of the product on behalf of net pet creating a new revenue stream for LYB. NATPETs assets are first quartile that have the advantage of sourcing local Saudi propane feedstock at a discount to global prices. Also our investment in NATPET provides a platform for continued growth. In 2022, NATPET was awarded a new feedstock allocation that could support additional capacity. The partners are evaluating a second PDH PP asset on the site that would benefit from meaningful synergies. Previously, Alujain selected LYB sphere zone polypropylene technology for the potential expansion. The high-performance polypropylene solutions enabled by our proprietary sphere zone technology provides the potential to expand NATPETs production into new applications and markets. We expect our investment in NATPET will exceed our 12% target for unlevered internal rates of return. The additional capacity could provide even higher returns. We expect the transaction will close in the first half of 2024 following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Yes, sure. I'll take a question for O&P and then maybe Kim, you can comment on IND. But for O&P, we continue to operate the joint venture at technical minimums. The focus really is on finding better product mix and customer mix in region. Our focus when we entered that joint venture was to build out an increased presence in the domestic market because we do market the high-density polyethylene and polypropylene from the asset. The team did a great job with that last year. So earnings, of course, are still very challenged in China. If you look at average margins, they're still slightly negative which we're seeing that in our asset. Even with a new world-scale asset, it still is a very challenging market, and we expect to start to see some improvement in that in the second half of the year. But so far, demand has been, I'd say, modestly improving, but haven't seen really an improvement in margins yet, Kim? No, that's it. I mean that just impacted the P&L with the absorption of the fixed costs that go along with that. But we pulled hard on the working capital lever, and we're going to continue to stay focused on maximizing cash flow. Challenging environment. Yes, I'll just add that part of the synergy that you had talked about before is that region is short of propylene. And so we're going to have additional propylene capacity with this expansion, which is one of the synergies around potentially executing that. But it will be financed by the joint venture. And yes, it will be proportionate for the shareholders, but we don't expect to be putting cash in. That's going to be something financed by the joint venture."

            "content": "Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on slide 18. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $12 million. Margins were pressured by higher raw material cost and volumes decreased due to seasonally lower fourth quarter demand with a slowdown in December due to customer outages. Likely inventory valuations benefits were $10 million. Looking ahead, we see signs of market recovery and expect modest demand improvement in the first quarter. This year, we continued our transformation journey with advanced polymer solutions. APS results in 2023 were lower than 2022 and not reflected of our financial expectations for this business. Success with APS customers is largely based on project-by-project qualification. Today's underperformance is indicative of our low success rate in gaining new qualifications during prior quarters. However, our laser focus on our customers is gaining momentum. We have seen a step up in our recent surveys for customer satisfaction. With an organization that is focused and accountable. We're making steady progress as we rebuild our project growth funnel. Our growth pipeline is already delivering. During the fourth quarter of 2023, volumes improved by 2.5% over the prior year. I want to congratulate the APS team for achieving record safety performance in 2023. I truly believe our customer focus, as measured by our recent customer satisfaction survey, our progress in refilling our growth funnel and our superior safety results reflects our attention to detail that provides a leading indicator for operational performance and eventual financial results. With that, I will return the call back to Peter."

During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results. Starting with Slide 3. We have three key messages for today's call. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results despite challenging market conditions. Our team delivered exceptional cash conversion during the quarter. And our balanced approach to capital deployment was on full display, as we repaid maturing bonds, funded investments to grow and maintain our assets and rewarded shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, thanks to great teamwork, we were able to bolster the cash on our balance sheet. Secondly, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy. You will recall that our strategy is built on three pillars. The first pillar reflects our commitment to actively grow and upgrade the core businesses that are aligned with our long-term strategy. We are growing our Intermediates & Derivatives segment through the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities, the largest single train propylene oxide plant in the world. In the third quarter, extremely strong margins for oxyfuels produced from our PO/TBA assets contributed to a record-setting quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Kim will provide more details on this in a few minutes. The other half of growing and upgrading our core involve difficult decisions about businesses and assets that do not really fit with our long-term direction. In September, we announced our intent to close one of our two polypropylene production units in Brindisi, Italy. And our plans to exit the refining business and transform the site are very well known. These actions are examples of how the pillars of our strategy reinforce each other. We're actively managing our business portfolio to reallocate resources toward assets and businesses that support the growth of our core, while building the second pillar of our strategy, a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. We continue to make good progress in this area, producing and marketing over 250,000 ton-site of recycled or renewable-based polymers since 2019. As Jim Seward and Yvonne van der Laan discussed in our MoReTec webinar last month, we're looking forward to a final investment decision later this quarter on our first commercial advanced catalytic recycling plant in Germany. And we are not sitting still, in just the past few weeks, we've announced joint ventures in two different Dutch plastic waste recycling companies, a stake in a circular plastic venture capital fund and a joint venture in infrastructure and recycled plastic feedstock\u2019s that support our plans for an integrated circular and low-carbon solutions here in Houston and also a renewable electricity supply agreement in Spain. Our value enhancement program aligns with the third pillar of our strategy, stepping up our performance and culture. I am pleased to announce that our VEP is on track to exceed our target for $200 million in recurring annual EBITDA run rate by the end of 2023. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our VEP target by $50 million, from our initial target of $150 million that we announced at our Capital Markets Day in March. The new phone value unlocked by the VEP supports our investments to grow our core, while building a profitable and game-changing circular and low-carbon solutions business. My third key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is strengthening our business portfolio to ensure our company is well positioned to capture value today and into the future. Our track record of effective cost management, operational excellence and innovation all provide competitive advantages. With a sharper focus on core businesses that benefit from leading positions in growing markets with attractive returns, we can maximize the impact of these competitive advantages. I hope you share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Safe operations are fundamental to our core values and provide the cornerstone for our future success. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.14, which means that our safety performance remains above the top 75th percentile for our industry. I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance. Let's turn to Slide 5 and summarize our financial results. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation from our well positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $2.46 per share. EBITDA was $1.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash from operating activities was $1.7 billion, with $7 billion of available liquidity. Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of efficient cash conversion that supports our investment-grade balance sheet and strong shareholder returns. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $5 billion of cash from operating activities. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $2.8 billion. Our team efficiently converted 102% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months.  Let's continue with Slide 7 and review the details of our capital deployment during the third quarter. LyondellBasell remains committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation that supports investment in our long-term strategy, while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.7 billion in cash from operating activities. Robust cash conversion, comfortably covered capital expenditures, paid down maturing bonds, and enabled a return of $448 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  As Peter mentioned, our team is focused on growing and upgrading our core businesses while actively managing our portfolio with the completion of our new PO/TBA assets, our capital expenditures are now focused on investments in building a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business and smaller profit generating projects as well as maintaining safe and reliable operations across our existing asset base.  I would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 8. LyondellBasell business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflected exceptional oxyfuel margins that fueled record quarterly EBITDA in I&D offset by lower margins from both O&P segments. Results in our olefins and polyolefin businesses were pressured by higher feedstock cost, new industry capacity and very challenging conditions in European markets.  In our last earnings call, we shared our expectation that third quarter EBITDA would decline from second quarter results. Subsequent events led to results that exceeded our expectations, primarily in our I&D segment. During August and into September, unplanned downtime at several assets across the U.S. Gulf Coast. Oxyfuels industry triggered a significant improvement in margins that increased I&D EBITDA by 50% relative to the second quarter. Our third quarter EBITDA for the company's did declined slightly, but clearly exceeded the upper end of our expectations.  We continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the fourth quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets, 75% for our European olefins and polyolefin and 70% for intermediates and derivative assets.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\nKen Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 9, with the performance of our olefins and polyolefin Americas segment. Third quarter O&P America's EBITDA was $504 million. Integrated polyethylene margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and continued oversupply. Global polyethylene trade flows appeared to be slowly normalizing toward pre pandemic conditions. Increasing export prices and volumes helped to support U.S. polyethylene contract price increases in both August and September.  In the fourth quarter, we expect strengthening polyethylene pricing supported by stable domestic volume and continued export strength. We also expect potential headwinds from volatile feedstock and energy costs.  U.S. polyethylene market as well supplied with recent capacity additions entering the market. We remain focused on our disciplined approach to match LyondellBasell's operating rates with market demand. Roughly two-thirds of LyondellBasell\u2019s North America polyethylene capacity is high density polyethylene. So we are pleased to see high density polyethylene inventories falling across the industry during September.  In support of our growth in circular and low carbon solutions, we announced the venture capital investment in Lombard Odier Plastic Circularity Fund. The fund aims to reduce pollution from plastics by investing in companies offering innovative solutions to improve the collection, sorting and recycling of plastic waste. This fund is another example of our comprehensive engagement and collaboration across the value chain to increase the availability of recycled feed stocks.  Just this week, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture between Agilyx, ExxonMobil and LyondellBasell to accelerate the development of a nationwide circular economy for plastics. The collaboration aims to capture more plastic waste from landfills and provide infrastructure and recycle materials at scale in support of our plans to build an integrated circular and low carbon solutions hub in the Houston area.  Please turn to Slide 10, as we review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment. In the third quarter, weak demand continued oversupply and higher naphtha costs impacted our European margins, resulting in an EBITDA loss of $45 million. As we approach year in, we expect European markets remain challenging, with weak demand that will likely persist. We anticipate modest polymer price increases, offsetting higher feedstock and energy costs. The slow but gradual return of Chinese demand seems to be providing some tailwinds for normalizing global trade flows.  Finally, we took several steps during the quarter to advance our long term strategy. As part of our goal to improve our focus on core assets and businesses, we made the difficult decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We also announced the acquisition of 50% stakes in two different Dutch recycling companies, Stiphout and De Paauw Sustainable Resources. Both companies are involved in the sourcing and processing of plastic packaging waste, and support our efforts to build scale by expanding the production of our circular and recovered products.  In line with our sustainability goals, we signed a renewable power purchase agreement for 149 megawatts of solar electricity generation capacity in Spain. With this LyondellBasell has rapidly achieved 78% of our 2030 target for renewable electricity with over 1.1 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity under agreements. I would like to recognize our teams for their quick and decisive actions to advance our strategy.  Now I will turn the call over to Kim.\nKim Foley: Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 11 as we look at the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record third quarter segment EBITDA of $708 million. During the quarter, unplanned industry downtime for oxyfuels production on the U.S. Gulf Coast led to higher blend premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline. When coupled with higher crude oil prices and relatively low cost for butane raw materials, oxyfuel margins expanded significantly in North America and Europe. The outstanding performance of our oxyfuels business during the third quarter is an example of how our diverse global business portfolio is capable of providing resilient results through market cycles. With our new PO/TBA asset, LyondellBasell's global oxyfuels capacity is now as large as our North American polyethylene capacity, highlighting the diversity of our growing portfolio. In our propylene oxide and derivatives business, additional volumes from the new PO/TBA asset were largely offset by the planned idling of two POSM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. These actions reflect our disciplined approach to match production rates with the demands during challenging market conditions. Looking ahead, we expect the end of summer driving season and the higher butane costs will cause oxyfuel margins to moderate towards levels seen in the first half of 2023. In line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the fourth quarter at two of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 70% capacity in the fourth quarter. In September, we expanded the range of our sustainable offerings with the launch of our +LC brand of low-carbon solutions. These products are sourced from recycled and renewable feedstock\u2019s and offer our customers a solution for meeting their greenhouse gas emissions targets with propylene oxide, styrene and other products that provide a lower carbon footprint than fossil-based alternatives. Please turn to Slide 12, and let's review the progress of our new PO/TBA asset. As Peter mentioned earlier, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow and upgrade our core by investing in businesses that fit our long-term strategy. Our new PO/TBA asset in Houston, Texas is a key part of that growth. This facility is the world's largest single-train asset increasing LyondellBasell's global propylene oxide and oxyfuels capacities by more than 35%. Furthermore, we believe that PO/TBA technologies are highly advantaged relative to other widely used propylene oxide technologies. By our analysis, PO/TBA technologies had the lowest operating cost and the lowest carbon footprint for producing propylene oxide. And our strategically located U.S. Gulf Coast assets benefit from the shale advantaged butane and propylene feedstocks. During the commissioning and the start-up of these assets, we achieved more than 4 million man hours of work without a recordable injury. This relentless focus on safety and the associated attention to detail is a key part of our success. Within two months of the plant start-up, we completed the technical acceptance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. In 2023, the ramp-up in our new capacity will be largely offset by planned maintenance at our existing PO/TBA assets, but we expect to see more meaningful volume contribution from the new PO/TBA asset in 2024 and beyond as the demand for durable goods return. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones and look forward to their continued success. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $105 million. Modest improvements in the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spread were offset by a mark-to-market impact from a distillate hedging program. As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we will occasionally use derivatives to hedge commercial or financial risks. During the third quarter, refinery cracks, particularly distillate cracks, were highly favorable relative to historical levels. And we took the opportunity to lock in attractive margins for a portion of our refinery output through 2024. Distillate cracks in September outperformed our expectations, resulting in mark-to-market losses for our distillate hedging program. In the near term, we expect seasonally slower demand for refined products and the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to decrease. Currently, we are executing planned maintenance on our catalytic cracker, with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million in the fourth quarter. We expect crude throughputs at the refinery to be approximately 80% of capacity in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025, with a focus on high reliability, as we develop new projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solutions growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Let's review the third quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 14. Third quarter EBITDA was $18 million. Margins decreased mostly due to the sales mix for the quarter and lower demand. This was partially offset by incremental volumes from our metal acquisition completed in July. In the fourth quarter, we expect demand to be similar to the third quarter across most APS businesses. With service levels to our customers now restored, our team is highly focused on refilling the growth pipeline for our business. And we are making good progress in increasing the number of sustainable solutions for our customers with high-performing recycled technical compounds from our newly acquired metal assets and product developments from across our existing asset footprint. Our expectations for the fourth quarter of this year are modest, but we look forward to steady improvement during 2024, as the projects in our growth pipeline begin to mature and make their way to the bottom line as we work towards the goals we discussed at our Capital Markets Day last March. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA of $146 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst results. In the fourth quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will be unusually low, and catalyst volumes will decrease. As a result, we estimate that full year 2023 technology segment EBITDA will be approximately $30 million lower than full year 2022. As discussed in the beginning of this call, we are targeting a final investment decision for a commercial scale plant using our MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology before the end of this year, and hope to share more details in our fourth quarter telephone conference. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that challenging market conditions will persist through the remainder of the year and into 2024. In addition, we expect additional pressures from typical fourth quarter seasonality associated with holidays and year-end inventory management. In the Americas, pricing is expected to be supported by increased polyethylene exports and stable demand. Integrated polyethylene margins will likely be constrained by higher feedstock costs and new market capacity. We expect that European markets will remain highly challenged. Weak market demand, coupled with rising feedstock and energy costs, are likely to continue to compress margins. In China, markets are slowly improving, and targeted stimulus initiatives seem to be providing some limited benefits. In our end markets, demand for consumer packaging is slow but steady, supported by the consumer and industrial packaging markets. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels low. Building and construction markets are slow, but we're watchful for potential benefits in the United States, enabled by stimulus from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips & Science Act. We expect demand from automotive production will continue to gain momentum. The UAW strike has not yet materially affected our results. Oxyfuel margins are expected to remain well above historical averages, but declined from third quarter records to a level similar to the first half of 2023. Distillate inventories are expected to remain on the low end of seasonal averages and gasoline inventories have risen with the end of the summer driving season. We will continue to optimize our operating rates to remain in step with market demand. Now let me summarize the third quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company with Slide 17. Exceptional oxyfuels margins enabled record results from our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. O&P margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and new industry capacity, amid stable but soft demand. Cash generation was outstanding, with $1.7 billion in cash from operations, which enabled us to return approximately $450 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as part of our balanced capital allocation framework. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally softer demand across our businesses, but we remain confident in our proven ability to navigate challenging markets and deliver results. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the three pillars of our long-term strategy. Our third quarter results demonstrate the benefits from growing our core with new capacity from our PO/TBA assets, and we are upgrading our business portfolio by improving our focus on this core. We are reallocating resources away from noncore assets and businesses.  At the same time, we are rapidly building a comprehensive business model to support the profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, where LyondellBasell benefits from participation up and down the value chain. And we are transforming our performance and culture to embrace a comprehensive approach to value creation. Our value enhancement program is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. And I am confident we will exceed our 2023 recurring annual EBITDA exit run rate target of $200 million. We are laser-focused in our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. With that, we are now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. A two-part question. Can you talk about profitability of your Bora joint venture in China? How that's changed through the course of the third quarter and into the fourth? And I think in the quarter, you bought back a minimal number of shares. Do you have a weighting between dividends and share repurchase that you think about? Or why was the share repurchase so small?\nPeter Vanacker: Great. Thank you, Jeff, for your questions. I mean, situation pretty much on Bora has not changed compared to the previous quarters. We continue to run at minimum capacity. Ken, do you want to add something?\nKen Lane: Yes. I would just say that we did have a turnaround that impacted the asset in the third quarter, Jeff. But what we are seeing is signs of some domestic growth in the market there, which is encouraging. However, the growth rate is still not where we needed to be to absorb all of the new capacity. But that asset is approaching breakeven levels of EBITDA, which is great to see, but still a very challenging market in China.\nJeff Zekauskas: And with regards to our capital allocation strategy, also here, nothing has changed. I mean, with regards into the share buybacks, Michael?\nMichael McMurray: No, sure, Jeff. So what I would say is that our capital allocation priorities remain fundamentally unchanged. I think really pleased with our cash flow performance this year and this quarter, in particular. I think really good execution. Pleased with the amount of working capital that we're able to take out of operations this quarter as well. And then again, I said looking forward, our commitments to shareholders remain intact. I think this has been demonstrated by our previous actions. You know that we communicated a 70% payout target for free cash flow, that stands. That said, we don't put capital allocation on autopilot. We have a point of view. And then clearly, given all the risks and uncertainties as we sit here today, we're being a little bit more cautious in the near term.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please proceed with your question. \nPatrick Cunningham : Hi, good morning. You guys had a record quarter in I&D, with strong oxyfuels, and now the PO/TBA plant is online. Maybe there's still some weakness in derivatives, but how should we think about margin set up into 2024 across each of the chains? And what sort of ramp up in EBITDA should we see from the PO/TBA plant as it gets to nameplate?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, Patrick. Very good question. Maybe let me, first of all, highlight, again that, of course, with a very successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant, the capacity mix in North America has, of course, changed. I mean, on one hand side, we have about 4.1 million tons of PE capacity in North America. And in oxyfuels, we have a global capacity now of 4.4 million tons. So I think that's important also to highlight that with that successful investment, our portfolio mix has, I mean, successfully changed. So with that, Kim, you want to say something around your outlook, I mean, for oxyfuel margins?\nKim Foley: Absolutely. Let me start by taking us back to Capital Markets Day. I think what we said then is mid-cycle margins for the cycle would produce an I&D EBITDA segment of about 1.6. So if you think about the new plant as an incremental $450 million, we're just north of $2 billion. Short term, this segment is challenged by weak, durable demand and capacity oversupply, which impacts both volume and margin in our current environment. But on the positive side, we continue to see really strong demand for oxyfuels. Margins are above historical levels. So as we discussed in Capital Markets Day, again, it's this diversity of this segment, combined with our global low-cost asset footprint that provides positive EBITDA through the cycle.\nPeter Vanacker: The team has done quite a lot of very good work as well in the global supply chain management by building up more flexibility in global supply chain and management on oxyfuels as well as on POs. So that will also help in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question. \nDavid Begleiter : Thank you. Good morning. Peter, you're having very good success with the Value Enhancement Program. What's the potential this program longer term? Can you get to $1 billion high run rate, do you think, in the '25 and beyond time frame?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, David, for your question. I'm actually very, very pleased with how the LyondellBasell team has embraced the value enhancement program. I mean I've done these programs in the past at other companies, and it took longer. We have about 4,000 or 5,000 people now involved. We just went to Phase E in having smaller sites that have now rolled out the Value Enhancement Program, also with a huge amount of success. As we said, I mean, our original target was first year, 150 million exit run rate EBITDA. We increased it to 200 million. Today, we actually said we're going to exceed that 200 million. We haven't changed our 750 million target. But as we have said in the past, I mean, this is not a project. It becomes part of the DNA. So it doesn't have a beginning and an end. So we can definitely say that it's not going to stop at 750 million as a consequence. So we will be able to capture more value. And we see that already happening because the sites that were involved in the first phase, they have already started going again, I mean, through new initiatives, new brainstorming sessions that they have captured. So we already start building up that certain, let's say, that first-level sites already have a new group of projects, new projects identified, I mean, to continue to increase value and creation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. \nSteve Byrne : Yes. Thank you. What would you put the probability that your refinery is selected as the DOE-funded hydrogen hub for Texas? And if it is, would that influence your choice of where to put the MoReTec process? And would it also potentially lead you to operate the hydro treaters and hydrocrackers longer than that first quarter of 2025 to keep them functional for longer-term utility and renewable fuels?\nPeter Vanacker: Thanks, Steve. Good question. I mean, of course, we were very pleased that amongst the seven projects that have been announced to receive funding, that the Houston High Velocity project has been included in that. Our project that we have on HROs, our refinery, is part of that high velocity. So we get very good support. That's great. Of course, we continue to develop that project. There's still a lot of steps, I mean, that need to be taken until we are at investment decisions. But it gives, of course, quite a lot of support already to move them into the next step. Having said that, of course, in the transformation of our Houston refinery, we have multiple projects that we are currently looking at. One of those projects is the upgrading of plastic oil that would come out of our MoReTec 2 investment. Remember, MoReTec 1 is the colon hub. MoReTec 2 will be much larger than MoReTec 1. And here, we are looking at the Houston hub. So MoReTec 2 investment in Houston, leveraging upon our equipment like hydro treaters that we have in Houston to upgrade that plastic oil and then having the interconnection through our pipelines with our channel view steam crackers. That's the second project.  Third project that we are looking at is leveraging upon those hydro treaters, to see if we can produce renewable hydrocarbons in the hydro treaters that again would leverage upon feeding them into the steam cracker. So they have a multitude of projects currently that we have in a very early phase, but we are having very dedicated teams analyzing these projects, and we will then, of course, follow the usual CapEx stage gate.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. Please proceed with your question. \nMatthew Blair : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Could you talk about dynamics in polypropylene? I think the Lyondell volumes were actually the highest in quite some time in this area. What kind of trends are you seeing on global supply and demand for both this year as well as into 2024?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Matthew. I'm going to give that question immediately to Ken.\nKen Lane: Yes. Thank you very much, and thanks, Matthew, for the question. The dynamics that we're seeing in polypropylene around supply and demand is similar to what we're seeing in PE. There's still a tremendous amount of new capacity that has come online over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in China. China has now pretty much become balanced and even has been exporting some polypropylene. So that market is challenged, but we have seen the demand come back in polypropylene and have started to see some growth quarter-over-quarter. One of the market segments -- frankly, when I look across all of the market segments for our division, the automotive segment this year is showing signs of improvement when I compare it to others like packaging. We also have seen some improvement in Catalloy, some bounce back in volumes in Catalloy, driven by commercial construction. So, in general, it's we still have a very good portfolio of assets, but a very challenging market environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nMike Leithead : Great. Thank you, good morning. I wanted to ask a bigger picture question on O&P EAI profitability. EBITDA has been quite challenged for maybe the past five quarters or so. I know you highlighted the polypropylene closure. But is there any larger scale asset shutdowns or restructuring being considered here? And is it simply a question of demand recovering? Or I guess how do you think about a potential pathway to get this segment back to its, call it, $1 billion or so historic EBITDA level?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Mike. Very good question. And as you well noted, we are in the midst now of negotiating with the union representatives on the shutdown of that one particular line that we have in the southern part of Italy and Brindisi. Of course, as usual, we continue to look at all the other assets that we have, not just, I mean, limited to the O&P business, but also the I&D business as well as the APS business. I mean some actions you have seen that we have taken. Like, for example, I mean, our joint venture that we have in the [indiscernible] on PO/SM. We have idled that a couple of times already this year, just like we did at the end of last year. So that continues for us to be very important that we look at all these different opportunities. But we have taken, I mean, that decision that we are planning to shut down, I mean, that one line in the southern part of Italy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question. \nFrank Mitsch: Thank you and good morning. And congrats on the nice results. If I look back three months ago, these 3 consensus was at $1.41 billion for the third quarter in EBITDA. And the company thought that, that was probably too high, and proactively went out with a guidance of $1.1 billion to $1.25 billion. Obviously, you outlined the reasons why the results came in better, actually right in line with that $1.41 billion.  But my question is, having taken that tact in the third quarter, as we stand here today, the Street is at $1.1 billion EBITDA for the fourth quarter, it begs the question in terms of no guidance that I would assume that Lyondell feels more positive about that results. Any color you could provide would be great.\nPeter Vanacker: Frank, thanks for your question. And absolutely, I mean, you're right. I mean about what we said on Q3, I mean we didn't call it guidance. But anyhow, the fact is, of course, I mean that during Q3, there were a couple of elements that happened in the markets. Like, for example, some of our peers had issues with their oxyfuels capacities. They had to take them offline. And due to the fact, of course, that we had our Holy Grail, I call it, of PO facilities in the world's successfully online, we were able, I mean, of course, to profit from that, not just I mean, with the volumes that we had available, but then also skyrocketing margins in that business. So our team -- there's a lot of details behind it, I mean, how our team was able to steer that between the different regions. And it shows the agility that we have in that business that we -- with those huge capacities that we have available in different parts in the world that we can maximize also the value. Remember, this is a core part of growing and upgrading the core, the first pillar that we have in our strategy. Now we've alluded also, if you talk about Q4, we've alluded to the fact that we have a normal seasonality in Q4. Kim also said with regards to Oxyfuels margins, they are higher, I mean, than what we have seen historically. We have the capacities, I mean, in place. But of course, one cannot always leverage or a situation whereby competition has issues, I mean, with their units. And therefore, we've said, I mean, margins in oxyfuels are going to be more, let's say, on an above historic level, but not on a peak level like it was in Q3. And then asset, I mean what is happening, I mean, at polyethylene and polypropylene and the olefins business. So I think we continue to be prudent when we are looking at Q4.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews : Thank you, Just the Lombard ODA investment, is that purely a financial investment? Or do you have opportunity to interact with the companies and collaborate with the companies that are being invested in? And does that give you an edge on any potential new technologies or things like that?\nPeter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you very much, I mean, Vincent, for that question. We've been, let's say, more strategic when we are looking at these kind of investments in funds. So of course, based upon our clearly articulated strategy at the Capital Markets Day, when we look at the second pillar of our strategy, building up a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, it's clear that in that area, we are looking at enhancing also our knowledge on what is happening in the marketplace. So that fund ticks that box because we have more visibility on the market. In addition to that, of course, we also want to make sure that we are supporting these early-stage technologies, companies that were in that fund so that they can continue to grow. So it is not a pure just venture financial investments. It's much more also looking at it from a strategic and conceptual point of view.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nHassan Ahmed: Good morning, peter. A quick one. Recently in the news, there's been a lot of talk about lower water levels in the Mississippi. So I was just wondering whether that's impacting you guys in any way or form or broadly the industry as well.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, Hassan, for your question. No impact, I mean, for our business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAleksey Yefremov : Thanks, good morning everyone. Your cyclic announcement comes on the heels of many other acquisitions you've made in this area, and perhaps not one of them separately is very large. But I mean, it adds up to potentially quite a bit of capital. Could you provide any clarity on how much capital so far went into these acquisitions? And what would be the sort of the run rate going forward for how to spend on deals like this?\nPeter Vanacker : Yes. Aleksey thank you for your question. The second pillar of our strategy as I just mentioned, it's mainly focused at the beginning on building up these renewable and circular apps, one in Europe, and that is around Cologne, Wesseling Knapsack where we have our assets. And the other one is around Houston, so HRO channel view. The way how we have at the Capital Markets Day articulated our strategy is that we both go upstream in working together with partners, so also investing in the upstream to get access, I mean, to plastic waste because we do believe that getting access, I mean to plastic waste is important. Then secondly, investing in both micro recycling and then also advanced recycling, leveraging, of course, upon the relationship that we have with start-up companies, but also upon our own advanced catalytic recycling technology, the so-called MoReTec technology, with the two first investments FID, that I have mentioned before. And then thirdly, also, we are looking at or access that we have in the marketplace through our APS business. And here, we have done this Mepol acquisition so that we actually were closer to the brand owners closer to the OEMs, where the demand is actually coming from. So we have the entire value chain where we are taking positions and that's why you see all these smaller deals that we are making because there is no one company that is covering the entire value chain or that is covering, let's say, the upstream or the downstream in the value chain. We've said at the Capital Markets Day around 15% of our investments, maybe a little bit more than that 15% in the investments over the period of time that we were talking about, I mean, 2027, 2030. So pretty much, I mean, in that ballpark, has not changed our view substantially, but I said maybe a bit more than the 15% because we see that we have very good traction. Michael?\nMichael McMurray : Yes, and then to specifically put a breadbox maybe around these investments, just to give people a bit more perspective. While they're important to the strategy, they're not material in amount. And so kind of what we've invested thus far is less than $200 million.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy : Yes, good morning. Maybe two questions on your I&D segment, please. First, as I understand your comments on oxyfuels, it sounds like you expect profitability to regress based on butane and maybe some other factors. Have you seen that already in October? Or is that just an expectation for the future? Would be the first question? And then secondly, are your POSM plants still down? Or have they come back up? And maybe you can help us with the timing of those outages 4Q versus 3Q in terms of sequential modeling considerations.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, Kevin, for your questions. I mean remember, I mean, oxyfuel margins what we said in Q3 were exceptional, but we continue because we are the lowest cost producer. We continue to be very comfortable, I mean, with higher margins than what we have seen historically. So I will lead it to Kim to answer in more detail your two questions.\nKim Foley : Absolutely. So let's talk about the profitability of oxyfuels first. So some of the key drivers for the profitability there would be the price of crude, would be your gasoline cracks, would be your ratio of crude to butane, as well as the premium that the market will pay to put octane into the gasoline pool. So what you really saw blow out in the third quarter was that premium that people wanted to get that octane into their gasoline pool. So to answer your question as it relates to October, yes, we've seen that premium come down we see some volatility in crude, right? But -- that's why we're saying they're higher than historical, but not the peaks that we saw in the third quarter. And then to answer your question on POSM operating rates, the guidance that we've given earlier in the presentation was 70% operating rates for the fourth quarter. So we have two of our PO/TBA plants down, and we've got our POSM plants up to meet that 70% operating rate.\nPeter Vanacker : And as you can see, I mean, we have the investments on the PO/TBA plant is a very successful investment as we are running at 70% in total of our capacity. That gives us a huge opportunity also to continue to grow. And again, that fits them into the first pillar of our strategy, growing and upgrading the core because these are markets that are growing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed the question.\nArun Viswanathan : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to, I guess, get some more detail on your thoughts on how you're thinking about polyethylene markets from here. So as you noted, there were the two increases for August and September. But we're still seeing some challenging conditions in China, and then some new absorption of new capacity. So as you look into '24, do you think that we've bottomed out on PE markets and we should see some sustainable increases here? How would you characterize that with -- against the backdrop of U.S. demand and your operating review as well?\nPeter Vanacker : Before I lead, I mean, to Ken to answer that question, I mean, the comfortable -- I mean, the positive thing that we have seen is, of course, that continuously PE exports have gone up during the last quarter. So that is, of course, a positive sign. But one would need to, of course, also look at additional capacity that has come in the markets or that has not really hit the market because of some perceived, I mean, what we're reading the paper technical difficulties. Ken?\nKen Lane : I'll just add to that, Arun, that we're seeing very good support for those exports with a high oil to gas ratio that we expect is going to continue, especially with the volatility around oil markets and gas production being relatively robust. So we do feel good about what's happening in the North American market. Europe is going to continue to be very challenged in terms of demand. That is still significantly down, mainly because of the inflation impacts but also the margins are challenged there with the higher naphtha pricing that we saw. So we've got good momentum coming out of the third quarter going into fourth quarter, seeing some signs of growth in China and really a very challenging market that's going to continue in Europe.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Joshua Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Spector : Yes, thanks. Actually I want to follow up on the last point that when you're looking at China. I think -- can you give us an update on what you're seeing in terms of inventory? And are we over the hump on the capacity additions there? Or does that impact the shape of the curve as we go into next year? What's your view around that?\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, Josh, and going to take to Ken because that's related, I mean, then to PE your question.\nKen Lane : Yes. So Josh, we're still going to see more capacity coming online next year, and that's why we're going to kind of be bouncing along the bottom. Overall, as an industry, I think, first half of next year and then the hope is in the back end of next year, we start to see some recovery in the market growth comes back to absorb the additional capacity, but there's going to be -- continue to be pressure around new capacity coming in, and that's going to be the biggest watch out for us.\nPeter Vanacker : Yes. You see, I mean, that from Beijing, there is continuously evaluations and incentives that are being put in place. We don't see the construction market now picking up yet. But if you then look, for example, in China, the motive has been 10% year-on-year increase and EV has actually has been closer in to 40%. But on the other hand side, I mean, we see the consumers continue to save, I mean, a lot of money. So savings continue to be at a high level. But more and more of these incentives, one would expect and, of course, also that the confidence will grow in the population in the middle class. And that, of course, would have then its influence on their spending on durable goods as well.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no other questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, again. Very good questions. And let me highlight again that we are very pleased, I mean, with the results, considering the market environment that we are in Q3. Great job that has been done by all the teams. We, of course, continue to look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to also make progress on the implementation of our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend and a safe one. Therefore, I wish you a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results. Starting with Slide 3. We have three key messages for today's call. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results despite challenging market conditions. Our team delivered exceptional cash conversion during the quarter. And our balanced approach to capital deployment was on full display, as we repaid maturing bonds, funded investments to grow and maintain our assets and rewarded shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At the same time, thanks to great teamwork, we were able to bolster the cash on our balance sheet. Secondly, we remain focused on executing our long-term strategy. You will recall that our strategy is built on three pillars. The first pillar reflects our commitment to actively grow and upgrade the core businesses that are aligned with our long-term strategy. We are growing our Intermediates & Derivatives segment through the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities, the largest single train propylene oxide plant in the world. In the third quarter, extremely strong margins for oxyfuels produced from our PO/TBA assets contributed to a record-setting quarterly EBITDA for our Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Kim will provide more details on this in a few minutes. The other half of growing and upgrading our core involve difficult decisions about businesses and assets that do not really fit with our long-term direction. In September, we announced our intent to close one of our two polypropylene production units in Brindisi, Italy. And our plans to exit the refining business and transform the site are very well known. These actions are examples of how the pillars of our strategy reinforce each other. We're actively managing our business portfolio to reallocate resources toward assets and businesses that support the growth of our core, while building the second pillar of our strategy, a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. We continue to make good progress in this area, producing and marketing over 250,000 ton-site of recycled or renewable-based polymers since 2019. As Jim Seward and Yvonne van der Laan discussed in our MoReTec webinar last month, we're looking forward to a final investment decision later this quarter on our first commercial advanced catalytic recycling plant in Germany. And we are not sitting still, in just the past few weeks, we've announced joint ventures in two different Dutch plastic waste recycling companies, a stake in a circular plastic venture capital fund and a joint venture in infrastructure and recycled plastic feedstock's that support our plans for an integrated circular and low-carbon solutions here in Houston and also a renewable electricity supply agreement in Spain. Our value enhancement program aligns with the third pillar of our strategy, stepping up our performance and culture. I am pleased to announce that our VEP is on track to exceed our target for $200 million in recurring annual EBITDA run rate by the end of 2023. As a reminder, last quarter, we increased our VEP target by $50 million, from our initial target of $150 million that we announced at our Capital Markets Day in March. The new phone value unlocked by the VEP supports our investments to grow our core, while building a profitable and game-changing circular and low-carbon solutions business. My third key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is strengthening our business portfolio to ensure our company is well positioned to capture value today and into the future. Our track record of effective cost management, operational excellence and innovation all provide competitive advantages. With a sharper focus on core businesses that benefit from leading positions in growing markets with attractive returns, we can maximize the impact of these competitive advantages. I hope you share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Safe operations are fundamental to our core values and provide the cornerstone for our future success. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.14, which means that our safety performance remains above the top 75th percentile for our industry. I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance. Let's turn to Slide 5 and summarize our financial results. During the third quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation from our well positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $2.46 per share. EBITDA was $1.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash from operating activities was $1.7 billion, with $7 billion of available liquidity. Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA of $146 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst results. In the fourth quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will be unusually low, and catalyst volumes will decrease. As a result, we estimate that full year 2023 technology segment EBITDA will be approximately $30 million lower than full year 2022. As discussed in the beginning of this call, we are targeting a final investment decision for a commercial scale plant using our MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology before the end of this year, and hope to share more details in our fourth quarter telephone conference. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that challenging market conditions will persist through the remainder of the year and into 2024. In addition, we expect additional pressures from typical fourth quarter seasonality associated with holidays and year-end inventory management. In the Americas, pricing is expected to be supported by increased polyethylene exports and stable demand. Integrated polyethylene margins will likely be constrained by higher feedstock costs and new market capacity. We expect that European markets will remain highly challenged. Weak market demand, coupled with rising feedstock and energy costs, are likely to continue to compress margins. In China, markets are slowly improving, and targeted stimulus initiatives seem to be providing some limited benefits. In our end markets, demand for consumer packaging is slow but steady, supported by the consumer and industrial packaging markets. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels low. Building and construction markets are slow, but we're watchful for potential benefits in the United States, enabled by stimulus from the Inflation Reduction Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Chips & Science Act. We expect demand from automotive production will continue to gain momentum. The UAW strike has not yet materially affected our results. Oxyfuel margins are expected to remain well above historical averages, but declined from third quarter records to a level similar to the first half of 2023. Distillate inventories are expected to remain on the low end of seasonal averages and gasoline inventories have risen with the end of the summer driving season. We will continue to optimize our operating rates to remain in step with market demand. Now let me summarize the third quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company with Slide 17. Exceptional oxyfuels margins enabled record results from our Intermediates & Derivatives segments. O&P margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and new industry capacity, amid stable but soft demand. Cash generation was outstanding, with $1.7 billion in cash from operations, which enabled us to return approximately $450 million to shareholders in dividends and share repurchases as part of our balanced capital allocation framework. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate seasonally softer demand across our businesses, but we remain confident in our proven ability to navigate challenging markets and deliver results. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the three pillars of our long-term strategy. Our third quarter results demonstrate the benefits from growing our core with new capacity from our PO/TBA assets, and we are upgrading our business portfolio by improving our focus on this core. We are reallocating resources away from noncore assets and businesses.  At the same time, we are rapidly building a comprehensive business model to support the profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, where LyondellBasell benefits from participation up and down the value chain. And we are transforming our performance and culture to embrace a comprehensive approach to value creation. Our value enhancement program is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. And I am confident we will exceed our 2023 recurring annual EBITDA exit run rate target of $200 million. We are laser-focused in our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. With that, we are now pleased to take your questions. Great. Thank you, Jeff, for your questions. I mean, situation pretty much on Bora has not changed compared to the previous quarters. We continue to run at minimum capacity. Ken, do you want to add something? Yes. Thank you, Patrick. Very good question. Maybe let me, first of all, highlight, again that, of course, with a very successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant, the capacity mix in North America has, of course, changed. I mean, on one hand side, we have about 4.1 million tons of PE capacity in North America. And in oxyfuels, we have a global capacity now of 4.4 million tons. So I think that's important also to highlight that with that successful investment, our portfolio mix has, I mean, successfully changed. So with that, Kim, you want to say something around your outlook, I mean, for oxyfuel margins? The team has done quite a lot of very good work as well in the global supply chain management by building up more flexibility in global supply chain and management on oxyfuels as well as on POs. So that will also help in the future. Thank you, David, for your question. I'm actually very, very pleased with how the LyondellBasell team has embraced the value enhancement program. I mean I've done these programs in the past at other companies, and it took longer. We have about 4,000 or 5,000 people now involved. We just went to Phase E in having smaller sites that have now rolled out the Value Enhancement Program, also with a huge amount of success. As we said, I mean, our original target was first year, 150 million exit run rate EBITDA. We increased it to 200 million. Today, we actually said we're going to exceed that 200 million. We haven't changed our 750 million target. But as we have said in the past, I mean, this is not a project. It becomes part of the DNA. So it doesn't have a beginning and an end. So we can definitely say that it's not going to stop at 750 million as a consequence. So we will be able to capture more value. And we see that already happening because the sites that were involved in the first phase, they have already started going again, I mean, through new initiatives, new brainstorming sessions that they have captured. So we already start building up that certain, let's say, that first-level sites already have a new group of projects, new projects identified, I mean, to continue to increase value and creation. Thanks, Steve. Good question. I mean, of course, we were very pleased that amongst the seven projects that have been announced to receive funding, that the Houston High Velocity project has been included in that. Our project that we have on HROs, our refinery, is part of that high velocity. So we get very good support. That's great. Of course, we continue to develop that project. There's still a lot of steps, I mean, that need to be taken until we are at investment decisions. But it gives, of course, quite a lot of support already to move them into the next step. Having said that, of course, in the transformation of our Houston refinery, we have multiple projects that we are currently looking at. One of those projects is the upgrading of plastic oil that would come out of our MoReTec 2 investment. Remember, MoReTec 1 is the colon hub. MoReTec 2 will be much larger than MoReTec 1. And here, we are looking at the Houston hub. So MoReTec 2 investment in Houston, leveraging upon our equipment like hydro treaters that we have in Houston to upgrade that plastic oil and then having the interconnection through our pipelines with our channel view steam crackers. That's the second project.  Third project that we are looking at is leveraging upon those hydro treaters, to see if we can produce renewable hydrocarbons in the hydro treaters that again would leverage upon feeding them into the steam cracker. So they have a multitude of projects currently that we have in a very early phase, but we are having very dedicated teams analyzing these projects, and we will then, of course, follow the usual CapEx stage gate. Thank you, Matthew. I'm going to give that question immediately to Ken. Thank you, Mike. Very good question. And as you well noted, we are in the midst now of negotiating with the union representatives on the shutdown of that one particular line that we have in the southern part of Italy and Brindisi. Of course, as usual, we continue to look at all the other assets that we have, not just, I mean, limited to the O&P business, but also the I&D business as well as the APS business. I mean some actions you have seen that we have taken. Like, for example, I mean, our joint venture that we have in the [indiscernible] on PO/SM. We have idled that a couple of times already this year, just like we did at the end of last year. So that continues for us to be very important that we look at all these different opportunities. But we have taken, I mean, that decision that we are planning to shut down, I mean, that one line in the southern part of Italy. Frank, thanks for your question. And absolutely, I mean, you're right. I mean about what we said on Q3, I mean we didn't call it guidance. But anyhow, the fact is, of course, I mean that during Q3, there were a couple of elements that happened in the markets. Like, for example, some of our peers had issues with their oxyfuels capacities. They had to take them offline. And due to the fact, of course, that we had our Holy Grail, I call it, of PO facilities in the world's successfully online, we were able, I mean, of course, to profit from that, not just I mean, with the volumes that we had available, but then also skyrocketing margins in that business. So our team -- there's a lot of details behind it, I mean, how our team was able to steer that between the different regions. And it shows the agility that we have in that business that we -- with those huge capacities that we have available in different parts in the world that we can maximize also the value. Remember, this is a core part of growing and upgrading the core, the first pillar that we have in our strategy. Now we've alluded also, if you talk about Q4, we've alluded to the fact that we have a normal seasonality in Q4. Kim also said with regards to Oxyfuels margins, they are higher, I mean, than what we have seen historically. We have the capacities, I mean, in place. But of course, one cannot always leverage or a situation whereby competition has issues, I mean, with their units. And therefore, we've said, I mean, margins in oxyfuels are going to be more, let's say, on an above historic level, but not on a peak level like it was in Q3. And then asset, I mean what is happening, I mean, at polyethylene and polypropylene and the olefins business. So I think we continue to be prudent when we are looking at Q4. Yes. Thank you very much, I mean, Vincent, for that question. We've been, let's say, more strategic when we are looking at these kind of investments in funds. So of course, based upon our clearly articulated strategy at the Capital Markets Day, when we look at the second pillar of our strategy, building up a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business, it's clear that in that area, we are looking at enhancing also our knowledge on what is happening in the marketplace. So that fund ticks that box because we have more visibility on the market. In addition to that, of course, we also want to make sure that we are supporting these early-stage technologies, companies that were in that fund so that they can continue to grow. So it is not a pure just venture financial investments. It's much more also looking at it from a strategic and conceptual point of view. Thank you, Hassan, for your question. No impact, I mean, for our business. Yes. Aleksey thank you for your question. The second pillar of our strategy as I just mentioned, it's mainly focused at the beginning on building up these renewable and circular apps, one in Europe, and that is around Cologne, Wesseling Knapsack where we have our assets. And the other one is around Houston, so HRO channel view. The way how we have at the Capital Markets Day articulated our strategy is that we both go upstream in working together with partners, so also investing in the upstream to get access, I mean, to plastic waste because we do believe that getting access, I mean to plastic waste is important.

So pretty much, I mean, in that ballpark, has not changed our view substantially, but I said maybe a bit more than the 15% because we see that we have very good traction. Michael? Thank you, Kevin, for your questions. I mean remember, I mean, oxyfuel margins what we said in Q3 were exceptional, but we continue because we are the lowest cost producer. We continue to be very comfortable, I mean, with higher margins than what we have seen historically. So I will lead it to Kim to answer in more detail your two questions. And as you can see, I mean, we have the investments on the PO/TBA plant is a very successful investment as we are running at 70% in total of our capacity. That gives us a huge opportunity also to continue to grow. And again, that fits them into the first pillar of our strategy, growing and upgrading the core because these are markets that are growing. Before I lead, I mean, to Ken to answer that question, I mean, the comfortable -- I mean, the positive thing that we have seen is, of course, that continuously PE exports have gone up during the last quarter. So that is, of course, a positive sign. But one would need to, of course, also look at additional capacity that has come in the markets or that has not really hit the market because of some perceived, I mean, what we're reading the paper technical difficulties. Ken? Thank you, Josh, and going to take to Ken because that's related, I mean, then to PE your question. Yes. You see, I mean, that from Beijing, there is continuously evaluations and incentives that are being put in place. We don't see the construction market now picking up yet. But if you then look, for example, in China, the motive has been 10% year-on-year increase and EV has actually has been closer in to 40%. But on the other hand side, I mean, we see the consumers continue to save, I mean, a lot of money. So savings continue to be at a high level. But more and more of these incentives, one would expect and, of course, also that the confidence will grow in the population in the middle class. And that, of course, would have then its influence on their spending on durable goods as well. Thank you, again. Very good questions. And let me highlight again that we are very pleased, I mean, with the results, considering the market environment that we are in Q3. Great job that has been done by all the teams. We, of course, continue to look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to also make progress on the implementation of our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend and a safe one. Therefore, I wish you a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of efficient cash conversion that supports our investment-grade balance sheet and strong shareholder returns. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $5 billion of cash from operating activities. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $2.8 billion. Our team efficiently converted 102% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months.  Let's continue with Slide 7 and review the details of our capital deployment during the third quarter. LyondellBasell remains committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation that supports investment in our long-term strategy, while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the third quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.7 billion in cash from operating activities. Robust cash conversion, comfortably covered capital expenditures, paid down maturing bonds, and enabled a return of $448 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.  As Peter mentioned, our team is focused on growing and upgrading our core businesses while actively managing our portfolio with the completion of our new PO/TBA assets, our capital expenditures are now focused on investments in building a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business and smaller profit generating projects as well as maintaining safe and reliable operations across our existing asset base.  I would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 8. LyondellBasell business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Our results reflected exceptional oxyfuel margins that fueled record quarterly EBITDA in I&D offset by lower margins from both O&P segments. Results in our olefins and polyolefin businesses were pressured by higher feedstock cost, new industry capacity and very challenging conditions in European markets.  In our last earnings call, we shared our expectation that third quarter EBITDA would decline from second quarter results. Subsequent events led to results that exceeded our expectations, primarily in our I&D segment. During August and into September, unplanned downtime at several assets across the U.S. Gulf Coast. Oxyfuels industry triggered a significant improvement in margins that increased I&D EBITDA by 50% relative to the second quarter. Our third quarter EBITDA for the company's did declined slightly, but clearly exceeded the upper end of our expectations.  We continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the fourth quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets, 75% for our European olefins and polyolefin and 70% for intermediates and derivative assets.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? No, sure, Jeff. So what I would say is that our capital allocation priorities remain fundamentally unchanged. I think really pleased with our cash flow performance this year and this quarter, in particular. I think really good execution. Pleased with the amount of working capital that we're able to take out of operations this quarter as well. And then again, I said looking forward, our commitments to shareholders remain intact. I think this has been demonstrated by our previous actions. You know that we communicated a 70% payout target for free cash flow, that stands. That said, we don't put capital allocation on autopilot. We have a point of view. And then clearly, given all the risks and uncertainties as we sit here today, we're being a little bit more cautious in the near term. Yes, and then to specifically put a breadbox maybe around these investments, just to give people a bit more perspective. While they're important to the strategy, they're not material in amount. And so kind of what we've invested thus far is less than $200 million."

            "name": "Kim Foley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 11 as we look at the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. Exceptional oxyfuel margins resulted in record third quarter segment EBITDA of $708 million. During the quarter, unplanned industry downtime for oxyfuels production on the U.S. Gulf Coast led to higher blend premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline. When coupled with higher crude oil prices and relatively low cost for butane raw materials, oxyfuel margins expanded significantly in North America and Europe. The outstanding performance of our oxyfuels business during the third quarter is an example of how our diverse global business portfolio is capable of providing resilient results through market cycles. With our new PO/TBA asset, LyondellBasell's global oxyfuels capacity is now as large as our North American polyethylene capacity, highlighting the diversity of our growing portfolio. In our propylene oxide and derivatives business, additional volumes from the new PO/TBA asset were largely offset by the planned idling of two POSM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. These actions reflect our disciplined approach to match production rates with the demands during challenging market conditions. Looking ahead, we expect the end of summer driving season and the higher butane costs will cause oxyfuel margins to moderate towards levels seen in the first half of 2023. In line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the fourth quarter at two of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 70% capacity in the fourth quarter. In September, we expanded the range of our sustainable offerings with the launch of our +LC brand of low-carbon solutions. These products are sourced from recycled and renewable feedstock's and offer our customers a solution for meeting their greenhouse gas emissions targets with propylene oxide, styrene and other products that provide a lower carbon footprint than fossil-based alternatives. Please turn to Slide 12, and let's review the progress of our new PO/TBA asset. As Peter mentioned earlier, the first pillar of our strategy is to grow and upgrade our core by investing in businesses that fit our long-term strategy. Our new PO/TBA asset in Houston, Texas is a key part of that growth. This facility is the world's largest single-train asset increasing LyondellBasell's global propylene oxide and oxyfuels capacities by more than 35%. Furthermore, we believe that PO/TBA technologies are highly advantaged relative to other widely used propylene oxide technologies. By our analysis, PO/TBA technologies had the lowest operating cost and the lowest carbon footprint for producing propylene oxide. And our strategically located U.S. Gulf Coast assets benefit from the shale advantaged butane and propylene feedstocks. During the commissioning and the start-up of these assets, we achieved more than 4 million man hours of work without a recordable injury. This relentless focus on safety and the associated attention to detail is a key part of our success. Within two months of the plant start-up, we completed the technical acceptance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. In 2023, the ramp-up in our new capacity will be largely offset by planned maintenance at our existing PO/TBA assets, but we expect to see more meaningful volume contribution from the new PO/TBA asset in 2024 and beyond as the demand for durable goods return. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones and look forward to their continued success. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $105 million. Modest improvements in the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spread were offset by a mark-to-market impact from a distillate hedging program. As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we will occasionally use derivatives to hedge commercial or financial risks. During the third quarter, refinery cracks, particularly distillate cracks, were highly favorable relative to historical levels. And we took the opportunity to lock in attractive margins for a portion of our refinery output through 2024. Distillate cracks in September outperformed our expectations, resulting in mark-to-market losses for our distillate hedging program. In the near term, we expect seasonally slower demand for refined products and the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to decrease. Currently, we are executing planned maintenance on our catalytic cracker, with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million in the fourth quarter. We expect crude throughputs at the refinery to be approximately 80% of capacity in the fourth quarter. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025, with a focus on high reliability, as we develop new projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solutions growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Absolutely. Let me start by taking us back to Capital Markets Day. I think what we said then is mid-cycle margins for the cycle would produce an I&D EBITDA segment of about 1.6. So if you think about the new plant as an incremental $450 million, we're just north of $2 billion. Short term, this segment is challenged by weak, durable demand and capacity oversupply, which impacts both volume and margin in our current environment. But on the positive side, we continue to see really strong demand for oxyfuels. Margins are above historical levels. So as we discussed in Capital Markets Day, again, it's this diversity of this segment, combined with our global low-cost asset footprint that provides positive EBITDA through the cycle. Absolutely. So let's talk about the profitability of oxyfuels first. So some of the key drivers for the profitability there would be the price of crude, would be your gasoline cracks, would be your ratio of crude to butane, as well as the premium that the market will pay to put octane into the gasoline pool. So what you really saw blow out in the third quarter was that premium that people wanted to get that octane into their gasoline pool. So to answer your question as it relates to October, yes, we've seen that premium come down we see some volatility in crude, right? But -- that's why we're saying they're higher than historical, but not the peaks that we saw in the third quarter. And then to answer your question on POSM operating rates, the guidance that we've given earlier in the presentation was 70% operating rates for the fourth quarter. So we have two of our PO/TBA plants down, and we've got our POSM plants up to meet that 70% operating rate."

            "name": "Ken Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 9, with the performance of our olefins and polyolefin Americas segment. Third quarter O&P America's EBITDA was $504 million. Integrated polyethylene margins were pressured by higher feedstock costs and continued oversupply. Global polyethylene trade flows appeared to be slowly normalizing toward pre pandemic conditions. Increasing export prices and volumes helped to support U.S. polyethylene contract price increases in both August and September.  In the fourth quarter, we expect strengthening polyethylene pricing supported by stable domestic volume and continued export strength. We also expect potential headwinds from volatile feedstock and energy costs.  U.S. polyethylene market as well supplied with recent capacity additions entering the market. We remain focused on our disciplined approach to match LyondellBasell's operating rates with market demand. Roughly two-thirds of LyondellBasell's North America polyethylene capacity is high density polyethylene. So we are pleased to see high density polyethylene inventories falling across the industry during September.  In support of our growth in circular and low carbon solutions, we announced the venture capital investment in Lombard Odier Plastic Circularity Fund. The fund aims to reduce pollution from plastics by investing in companies offering innovative solutions to improve the collection, sorting and recycling of plastic waste. This fund is another example of our comprehensive engagement and collaboration across the value chain to increase the availability of recycled feed stocks.  Just this week, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture between Agilyx, ExxonMobil and LyondellBasell to accelerate the development of a nationwide circular economy for plastics. The collaboration aims to capture more plastic waste from landfills and provide infrastructure and recycle materials at scale in support of our plans to build an integrated circular and low carbon solutions hub in the Houston area.  Please turn to Slide 10, as we review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and international segment. In the third quarter, weak demand continued oversupply and higher naphtha costs impacted our European margins, resulting in an EBITDA loss of $45 million. As we approach year in, we expect European markets remain challenging, with weak demand that will likely persist. We anticipate modest polymer price increases, offsetting higher feedstock and energy costs. The slow but gradual return of Chinese demand seems to be providing some tailwinds for normalizing global trade flows.  Finally, we took several steps during the quarter to advance our long term strategy. As part of our goal to improve our focus on core assets and businesses, we made the difficult decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We also announced the acquisition of 50% stakes in two different Dutch recycling companies, Stiphout and De Paauw Sustainable Resources. Both companies are involved in the sourcing and processing of plastic packaging waste, and support our efforts to build scale by expanding the production of our circular and recovered products.  In line with our sustainability goals, we signed a renewable power purchase agreement for 149 megawatts of solar electricity generation capacity in Spain. With this LyondellBasell has rapidly achieved 78% of our 2030 target for renewable electricity with over 1.1 gigawatts of wind and solar capacity under agreements. I would like to recognize our teams for their quick and decisive actions to advance our strategy.  Now I will turn the call over to Kim. Yes. I would just say that we did have a turnaround that impacted the asset in the third quarter, Jeff. But what we are seeing is signs of some domestic growth in the market there, which is encouraging. However, the growth rate is still not where we needed to be to absorb all of the new capacity. But that asset is approaching breakeven levels of EBITDA, which is great to see, but still a very challenging market in China. Yes. Thank you very much, and thanks, Matthew, for the question. The dynamics that we're seeing in polypropylene around supply and demand is similar to what we're seeing in PE. There's still a tremendous amount of new capacity that has come online over the last 12 to 18 months, especially in China. China has now pretty much become balanced and even has been exporting some polypropylene. So that market is challenged, but we have seen the demand come back in polypropylene and have started to see some growth quarter-over-quarter. One of the market segments -- frankly, when I look across all of the market segments for our division, the automotive segment this year is showing signs of improvement when I compare it to others like packaging. We also have seen some improvement in Catalloy, some bounce back in volumes in Catalloy, driven by commercial construction. So, in general, it's we still have a very good portfolio of assets, but a very challenging market environment. I'll just add to that, Arun, that we're seeing very good support for those exports with a high oil to gas ratio that we expect is going to continue, especially with the volatility around oil markets and gas production being relatively robust. So we do feel good about what's happening in the North American market. Europe is going to continue to be very challenged in terms of demand. That is still significantly down, mainly because of the inflation impacts but also the margins are challenged there with the higher naphtha pricing that we saw. So we've got good momentum coming out of the third quarter going into fourth quarter, seeing some signs of growth in China and really a very challenging market that's going to continue in Europe. Yes. So Josh, we're still going to see more capacity coming online next year, and that's why we're going to kind of be bouncing along the bottom. Overall, as an industry, I think, first half of next year and then the hope is in the back end of next year, we start to see some recovery in the market growth comes back to absorb the additional capacity, but there's going to be -- continue to be pressure around new capacity coming in, and that's going to be the biggest watch out for us."

            "content": "Thank you, Kim. Let's review the third quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 14. Third quarter EBITDA was $18 million. Margins decreased mostly due to the sales mix for the quarter and lower demand. This was partially offset by incremental volumes from our metal acquisition completed in July. In the fourth quarter, we expect demand to be similar to the third quarter across most APS businesses. With service levels to our customers now restored, our team is highly focused on refilling the growth pipeline for our business. And we are making good progress in increasing the number of sustainable solutions for our customers with high-performing recycled technical compounds from our newly acquired metal assets and product developments from across our existing asset footprint. Our expectations for the fourth quarter of this year are modest, but we look forward to steady improvement during 2024, as the projects in our growth pipeline begin to mature and make their way to the bottom line as we work towards the goals we discussed at our Capital Markets Day last March. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter."

During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with Slide 3. During today's call, we will discuss the resilient results that our team delivered during the challenging marketing conditions of the second quarter. And we will also provide an overview of our outlook for the second half of this year as well as our plans to optimize our advantaged positions to navigate volatile markets and feedstock costs. But first, let's take a few moments to review LyondellBasell's foundations and the progress we have made with our long-term strategy. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety results. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.15. While slightly higher than our results for 2022, our focus on safety continues to deliver performance that exceeds the top 75th percentile for our industry. Our leading safety results produce benefits that are reflected in our operations and ultimately, in our financial performance. Safety is a fundamental part of our core values and it will continue to be a critical enabler for our strategy and our future success. Let's turn to Slide 5 and review the progress on our long-term strategy. As we shared during our Capital Markets Day in March, our strategy is built around 3 pillars: grow and upgrade the core, build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and step up performance and culture. We are confident we have the right strategy, and we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress. Let me highlight some of our actions on these pillars over the past few months. Our value enhancement program is providing benefits for 2 of the pillars in our strategy. The VEP is generating volume growth as part of grow and upgrade the core and margin improvement captured within step up performance and culture. I am pleased to see the rapid progress and execution of these VEP initiatives. We are raising our 2023 VEP target for year-end annual recurring EBITDA run rate by $50 million to $200 million based on mid-cycle margins to reflect our accelerated progress. I will provide more details on this progress in a few minutes. In grow and upgrade the core, we are investing in our business that fits with our long-term strategy. Last quarter, we announced a successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This quarter, our team successfully completed technology performance tests to prove out the full capacity of the new facility. We're also managing our portfolio to ensure that all businesses are aligned with our long-term strategy. In May, we announced that we are extending our refining operations to no later than the first quarter of 2025. Let me be clear, we have not changed our decision to exit the refining business. The extension of operations will allow us to develop options to redeploy the site's workforce and assets in support of the company's sustainable growth strategy. Now let's turn to the second pillar of our strategy. We're committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business to drive our leadership in circularity and address the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. We expect this business will generate at least $0.5 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2030. Through multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements, we are building a comprehensive business model with powerful competitive advantages that come from new technologies, [indiscernible] sources of recycled and renewable feedstocks and downstream relationships with our customers and brand owners. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Last October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve our line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. We're leveraging the structure of our VEP to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. And Torkel and his team were making solid progress on transforming the performance of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Altogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to provide focus and alignment to drive our progress in capturing value and delivering a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at our approach to establishing leadership in circular solutions. As [Devon] stated at our Capital Markets Day in March, our circular and low-carbon solutions business is taking a differentiated approach by gaining advantage in 3 key areas: technologies, feedstocks and downstream customer relationships. We believe that our comprehensive strategy based on regional health will establish LyondellBasell as the leader in sustainable solutions. We're expanding our participation further up and down the plastic waste value chain to both gain scale and maximize the returns of various waste streams around the world. Today, our team is building supply chains to bring feedstocks into our existing facilities and driving innovation through investments in new technologies. As you saw on the previous slide, we are investing in both internal and external technologies such as LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling process as well as Pryme's pyrolysis process and LMF Nord's mechanical recycling. In line with our sustainability goals, we are advancing our carbon reduction initiatives through partnerships. In June, we signed an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric cracker demonstration unit in Channelview, Texas. We have completed power purchase agreements to support the development and procurement of renewable power for LyondellBasell's locations around the world. These partnerships utilize the unique strengths of each party to deliver superior results with a common goal, reducing the carbon intensity of our products to increase the value of our products for our customers. And we are leveraging the unique capabilities of our APS segment to upgrade our mechanical recycling portfolio while offering tailored solutions for our customers. Most importantly, we are building a business that provides these solutions at scale. Step by step, we are making progress toward our 2030 goal to sell 2 million tons of recycled or renewable-based polymers annually. Since 2019, we have produced and marketed approximately 220,000 tons of these polymers. LyondellBasell's differentiated approach uniquely positions us to unlock significant value as we address the needs of our customers and society. On Slide 7, we ask that you save the date for a webinar on September 26, with Jim Seward, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer; and Yvonne van der Laan, EVP of circular and low-carbon solutions will share more details on our MoReTec technology and our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We hope that you can join us virtually. Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss this year's updated target for our value enhancement program. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. Since the launch of our VEP, we have inspired a more agile and entrepreneurial mindset throughout our workforce. When we launched the value enhancement program last year, we announced targets to deliver recurring annual EBITDA improvements, run rates of $150 million by the end of 2023 and $750 million by the end of 2025. Our team is progressing ahead of plan for 2023. As we expanded the VEP to Europe and smaller U.S. sites during the first and second quarter, we found the enthusiasm and energy gaining momentum. We now think our recurring annual EBITDA improvement will reach a run rate of at least $200 million by the end of 2023. Let's get a bit more specific about a few of these VEP initiatives on Slide 9. At our low-density polyethylene manufacturing facilities in Clinton, Iowa, our team faced recurring reliability challenges related to valve controllers. With an investment of approximately $60,000, our team was able to upgrade the controllers and unlock more than $400,000 of annual value. The project was executed during a planned outage with VEP providing the resources required to rapidly resolve this chronic issue. Modest investment across our global engineering and procurement teams unlocked an opportunity to expand the supplier pool for electric motors at our manufacturing sites. We expect a direct annual cost benefit of $400,000 as well as an improvement in the security of our supply for these critical motors. These benefits will be realized with a total resource investment of only $70,000 over the next 3 years. At our Channelview facility, we invested the engineering resources required to implement a new process control scheme to improve yields and decrease energy consumption and distillation towers. Through better steam control and increased butadiene yields, we will realize $1.4 million in annual value at a onetime cost of $50,000. In addition to the direct financial benefits, this project supports our sustainability goals by reducing CO2 emissions by over 9 kilotons. One of our larger VEP initiatives will install a filtration system to remove solids from a byproduct stream at our olefins plant in Channelview. By upgrading the byproducts, we anticipate over $5.1 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvement from higher margins and increased utilization through a modest $550,000 investment. These examples are representative of the hundreds of initiatives in our VEP portfolio. The average annual benefit of our initiative is less than $1 million. But the program is supported by rigorous economic analysis, diligent tracking and an evergreen process. The value enhancement program has been the catalyst within our organization to rapidly implement good ideas to create value. We look forward to providing you with regular updates on our progress as these initiatives become more prominent in our results. Let's turn to Slide 10 and focus on our financial results for the second quarter. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation despite challenging market conditions. Earnings were $2.44 per share. EBITDA was $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash on hand was $2.5 billion with $6.6 billion of available liquidity.  Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray : Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11 and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash conversion. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Our cash balance was $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our team efficiently converted 103% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 12 and review the details of our cash allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our robust cash generation comfortably covered our capital expenditures of approximately $300 million as well as our $500 million of returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.25 per share. 2023 will mark our 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. In May, we issued our first green bond to support investments that advance our strategy for leadership in sustainability. After the start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities in the first quarter, we successfully demonstrated full operating rates on these assets. Our capital expenditures are now focused on continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects. With the rapid progress in the value enhancement program and the extension of operations at our refinery, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will increase to $1.7 billion, $100 million higher than our original guidance of $1.6 billion. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets. 75% for our European olefins and polyolefins and intermediates and derivative assets and just below 95% for our refinery. In the appendix of the slide deck, we provide updated 2023 modeling guidance, CapEx and several other items, including refresh estimates on cost and capital expenditures associated with extending the operations at our refinery business. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 13. The LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter. Our results reflect modest improvements in O&P margins and higher I&D volumes, offset by weaker refining margins. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from lower feedstock costs. Demand for oxyfuels remained strong, while margins in our refining business declined due to lower refining crack spreads.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?\nKen Lane : Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 14 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the second quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $138 million to $679 million. North American integrated polyethylene margins increased on higher U.S. sales prices and lower ethane costs, while weak demand for durable goods continued to impact polypropylene margins. In the third quarter, we expect volatile feedstock costs and new capacity entering the market will compress margins. Also, demand is being impacted by cautious buying by our customers due to the uncertain economic outlook. As Peter mentioned, we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress on strategy. On June 1, we announced an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric furnace demonstration unit at our Channelview, Texas site. The technology could enable the company to use renewable electricity as a heat source for ethylene cracking and significantly reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our olefins production. This collaboration is just one of many initiatives underway to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business for LyondellBasell. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the second quarter, European ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs but this was offset by weak demand for polymers used in durable products. As a result, O&P EAI second quarter EBITDA increased $7 million to $84 million. Looking ahead, we expect the European and Asian markets to remain challenging with consumer uncertainty and energy cost volatility. Slow economic recovery, combined with additional supply in China will continue to be a headwind. Finally, we are growing our portfolio of recycled and renewable based polymers from consolidating our ownership in QCP mechanical recycling, investing in Pryme's plastic waste pyrolysis process, and building a flexible packaging recycling facility through LMF Nord, our CLCS team continues to build out our regional hub model to advance our leadership in circular and renewable solutions. Having said that, I want to emphasize the focus our team has on generating value and cash from operations. Our team is highly seasoned and is doing a great job at both. I want to be sure and acknowledge all of their hard work.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kim.\nKim Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased $46 million in the second quarter to $472 million. Additional capacity from our new propylene oxide facility was largely offset by planned maintenance downtime. Propylene oxide and derivative margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Demand for oxyfuels remains strong when margins were slightly lower. In line with the guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the third quarter on 2 of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 75% of capacity in the third quarter, which includes the idling of 2 PO/SM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. In the second half of the year, we expect oxyfuel margins to compress as cost seasonally increase for butane are key raw material. Last quarter, we discussed the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant. This quarter, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the technology performance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. The second quarter EBITDA declined by approximately $200 million to $114 million as the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads settled by more than $9 a barrel relative to the first quarter. Spreads for other heavy crude oil run at our refinery, such as the Canadian WCS declined further than Maya, providing additional headwinds to our margins. In the near term, we expect demand for refined products to remain stable and inventories to remain low. The recent elevation of crack spreads will likely moderate as outages in the refining industry are resolved. Nonetheless, we expect Maya 2-1-1 spreads to remain above historical averages. In the third quarter, we plan to operate the refinery at approximately 93% of capacity. This rate provides optimal economics for our asset based on our plans for crudes, products and operations ahead of our maintenance work. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability. In the fourth quarter, we are planning for FCC maintenance with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million. We are extending operations at our refinery to no later than the first quarter of 2025. This extension will help to bridge activities at the site as we develop new projects to transform site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy.  With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Let's review the second quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA moderately increased to $34 million. Margins for the polypropylene company business increased as product prices improved and energy costs decreased. We saw lower demand from the construction and electronics markets, while demand from the automotive markets gained momentum during the quarter. We expect demand in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter across most APS businesses. Typical third quarter downtime at OEMs will offset some of the automotive production gains we have seen in the first half of 2023 in Europe and North America. Our number 1 priority in APS is to restore service levels to our customers and restore growth in the business. I'm happy to report that we have restored our service levels, and we're making good progress in refilling our growth pipeline. APS has a lot of project-based business and our growth pipeline depends on winning a spot on the next automotive platform launch with the next color design. One KPI that we track is the number of color and concentrate request we service. In Europe, the number of requests increased by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter relative to our performance in the second half of 2022. We still have a long path to complete our transformation, but our team is making tangible progress in delivering improved results. In early July, we completed our acquisition of the Mepol Group, a manufacturer of recycled high-performing technical compounds located in Italy and Poland. Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our strategy to be the leader in providing sustainable solutions for our customers. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker : Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segments on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $79 million reflected higher licensing revenue and lower catalyst volumes. In the third quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will moderately improve. As a result, we estimate that the third quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the quarterly results seen in the first 3 quarters of 2022. As discussed in the previous earnings call, we expect that LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology will be a key enabler for scaling up our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant in Cologne, Germany is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and announced an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Please turn to Slide 20 and I will discuss the market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that the challenging market conditions of the second quarter will continue for the remainder of the year. And the America's fundamental demand is stopped and we see cautious buying from our customers and consumers. Margins are expected to be pressured by near-term volatility in feedstock costs and new capacity. The potential for energy cost volatility and associated consumer caution looms over the European markets, despite moderation in feedstock and energy costs relative to 2022. In China, strength in Consumer Services has not been sufficient to offset slow recovery in durable goods, infrastructure and export activity. Markets are not reflecting much benefit from the initial stimulus measures. Demand for consumer packaging is stable, supported by the service industries. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels cautiously low. Building and construction markets are relatively flat with benefits from new housing starts offset by reduced sales and maintenance for existing homes as owners resist trading into higher mortgage rates. We're watchful for tailwinds in the United States from stimulus enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act, to be part of the infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act. Demand from automotive market seems to be gaining momentum. However, there may be some headwinds from the typical downtime at OEMs in the third quarter. Oxyfuels and refining markets continue to see stable demand as refined product inventories remain low. At LyondellBasell, we optimize our well-positioned assets across the world. We will continue to align our operating rates with market demand and steered through all stages of the business cycle. Now let me summarize our second quarter outlook and our long-term strategy for our company with Slide 21. Our second quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value to our new strategy despite challenging markets. Margins for our O&P businesses moderately improved amid tipid demand. Although lower than the first quarter, our oxyfuels and refining margins remained above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. Cash generation in the second quarter was outstanding with $1.3 billion in cash from operations and an impressive cash conversion of 103% over the past 4 quarters. We returned $508 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate soft demands and additional polyolefins capacity in North America and Asia will lead to further margin compression. We expect LyondellBasell's third quarter EBITDA will be mid-teens to mid-20 percentage points lower than the second quarter. We remain watchful for near-term risks and opportunities across sectors and geographies. At our Capital Markets Day in March, we shared our excitement around our new forward strategy. And during the call today, we provided updates on our progress to capture incremental value across the 3 pillars of the strategy. I want to emphasize that we are not allowing current conditions to slow us down. Our value enhancement program has generated incredible energy and enthusiasm across our workforce, from frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions to sales and support teams serving our customers around the world. LyondellBasell VEP is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. We're making steady progress on our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Christopher Parkinson with Mizuho.\nChristopher Parkinson : Great. Just taking a step back on Slide 14. You had a pretty solid 2Q in the Americas. But at the same time, as you've been consistently highlighting, there's been a lot of volatility in NGL pricing, there's going to be a difference in operating rates in the second half. There's a little bit of a choppy macro picture. Just when we're thinking about integrated olefin margins, just how should we be thinking about the run rate for the second half and in 2024, just want to take a look at the current dynamics? And then any comments on how you expect this to eventually inflect and improve, hopefully, next year.\nKen Lane: Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Like we have said in the remarks that we made, we do expect it to be volatile. So the good news is we've seen NGL prices come down. NAV was really peaking in July, but we do see that coming off here in August, but it did have an impact in July. That's not going to continue. The inventory levels for NGLs are still very healthy and production is growing. So overall, we expect that we're going to see advantages with NGL production here in the U.S., especially with ethane. Now having said that, we still do have a lot of new supply that's coming into the market. And at the end of the second quarter, we saw prices in the Americas coming down and that's going to continue into the third quarter, let's say, it's going to carry into the third quarter. We've seen some green shoots in the export market. So I think we're kind of bouncing along the bottom here. But it's just going to support that theme of continued volatility going forward. What I would expect is that we're going to see that normal seasonality going into the fourth quarter, some weakness on volumes. Q1 will typically be a little bit better. And then when we get into the second half of next year is when I expect to start to see things really improve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs.\nDuffy Fischer : Question around the export split versus sales in North America. So if you would -- maybe 3 parts. So where are you guys on that split? Where do you think the U.S. industry is and then when you think about the 3 plants that are going to start up or are in the process of starting up, where do you think their split will be in their first year of operations?\nPeter Vanacker: That's a very good question, Duffy. Let me hand it over to Ken on the olefins and polyolefins side.\nKen Lane: Duffy. Yes, so listen, we have traditionally been lower in terms of a percentage for exports in our portfolio, and you see that this year. Now some of that as well is driven by the turnaround that we've had in the first half of the year. We've got some of our capacity down right now in the Midwest. So we've been a little bit lower on the export sales in the first half of the year. As an industry, the Americas or the U.S. typically is exporting somewhere around 35% to 40% of the capacity. Normally, when these new assets come online, you're looking at them exporting significantly above that level for the first year or so as they work their way into the market. But I don't see any change in the midterm around the industry being at that 40% level of exports, but it's always our goal to find the highest value for our products. And that is in the domestic market. So our focus is on serving the customers here and building out a portfolio that is more resilient by supplying domestic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America.\nSteve Byrne : Yes. Is e-cracker concept that you're pursuing, is that fair to assume that this would require a complete rebuild and not a retrofit. And if so, how do you look at the economics of that approach versus these multiple hydros that you have at your refinery that you could produce renewable map, particularly if the DOE goes along with your hydrogen hub proposal.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Steve. Very good question that you're asking. I mean what we are doing here together with our partners is, first of all, developing the technology further into, let's call it, a semi industrial scale. So this is not replacing, but it is feeding into a cracker. Next to that, of course, we are following different other avenues in order to prepare ourselves, I mean, for more renewable hydrocarbons. And here, that's what we are looking at, at the refinery and how can we leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have. So there will not be one solution fits all is the key message, but we are playing, let's say, very broadly, being technology agnostic, and investing in the different types of technologies that eventually where we then would decide to invest in those technologies on an industrial scale. We're talking about 2013 plus in my view. Then, of course, there can be different solutions depending on where you are in the world.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Richardson with Evercore ISI.\nSteve Richardson : I was wondering if you could ask on APS, Torkel. I appreciate the update. I was wondering if you could maybe remind us of some of your longer-term goals in terms of restoring profitability. It sounds like you're making some good inroads. And then also I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about more if acquisitions should be expected to be persistent part of the outlook there or if this is something unique.\nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you. So as we communicated, our target is to get the business to what we believe is very feasible that the $0.5 billion earnings by 2027. And that's the plan that we have embarked on. And I have to say we are at the current moment right as I expect us to be. I've led multiple business transformations, and this is where I expect us to be at this time. So if you look at our earnings performance, I think fourth quarter of last year was the bottom, and we have then 2 months behind us where we are gradually improving it, but it is a multi-year effort for us and we're feeling the growth pipeline, as I mentioned, is our number 1 priority, and we're making good progress, but that also takes time. But it is our focus. In terms of acquisitions, the Mepol, I think, was an acquisition that perfectly fit in, but there is nothing else that we have that we are in that sort of category for our space at the moment.\nPeter Vanacker: And here -- it's Peter. I mean just to add to that, I mean, in terms of the acquisitions, I mean, one needs to look at the Mepol acquisition, being at the boundary, the interface between circular and low-carbon solutions and then the APS business with the compounding. So Mepol has a very strong mechanical recycling position in those different markets, and that's what made it so attractive for us to do that acquisition.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets.\nArun Viswanathan : Just wanted to follow up on your outlook for O&P margins across both North America and EIA. So it calls -- it looks like you're calling for double-digit declines in your profitability in Q3 sequentially from Q2. Can you just walk us through some of those mechanics? I know that we had the $0.03 decline in June on polyethylene. Are you looking for further declines in Q3? And just wondering, given the feedstock volatility there as well and then the recent decline in ethane prices, or is it continued weakness in volume? Or is it a little bit of both? Or maybe just walk us through some of the tanks.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Maybe first of all, let me repeat what has been said in the prepared remarks is that we have an outlook, I mean, for Q3, which we believe will be mid mid-double digits, so mid-teens to mid-20s, lower in terms of EBITDA compared to [indiscernible] Q2. And why that relatively broad range still because as you know, I mean, we have a very broad portfolio of different products. And we've seen a bit of improvements in the refinery markets. On the one hand side, we continue to believe, I mean, that we will have strong oxyfuel margins as Kim mentioned in the prepared remarks. But then, of course, I mean, with the volatility that you see in the olefins and polyolefins markets and then China still not being back as it should be at this point in time right now. So we will then, of course, fine-tune that towards more at the end of the quarter. When you Michael will speak on a conference, and then we'll give a further update on where we are standing, I mean, in that quarter. So with that, I mean, on the O&P maybe answer that question as well. I mean, Ken, if you can give some additional?\nKen Lane: Yes, like I had said previously, we're looking at the feedstock kind of peaked in July. So that definitely is going to hurt us versus Q2, if you think about it sequentially. Also, like I said, with prices coming down in the U.S. at the end of Q2, that's carried into Q3, so both of those are going to be headwinds. Then there is some volume component to that. Q2 is normally our peak fall in terms of seasonality and in Q3, especially in Europe, in the summer months, you start to see the volume slow down. So we will have some volume slowdown in Q3 as well. Overall, I expect that we are, like I said, bumping along here on margins in Q3 in terms of being at the bottom.\nMichael McMurray : And then what I would remind investors is that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally weak to the third. Just as a reminder.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov : Government in China recently included the plastics industry, specifically in their economic support program, just very recently. Do you have any insight into how the support actually is implemented in practice. It sounds like you haven't seen much benefit so far. But -- just any color on specific program maybe that you have would be helpful --\nPeter Vanacker: Yes, Aleksey, I mean, we have seen a couple of areas where that eventually could have an impact. But at this point in time, it's too premature to say, I mean how much that impact will be. Our people, as you know, they are on the ground, I mean, following that. There seems to talks around, I mean, automotive industry, talks about white goods industry, but too premature, I mean, to say because we need -- we've seen a couple of these initiatives so far, but we are rather in a wait-and-see position now and ready. I mean, if the market would see, I mean, an uptick because all the initiatives so far have not had the impact as we would have hoped despite the fact, I mean, that the saving rates of individuals is extremely high, I mean, in China.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch : I had a question on I&D. You noted in your slide that you're anticipating a $20 million headwind in 3Q from turnarounds, but also you indicated that you're shutting down 2 PO/SM plants for both the months of July and August, I assume that that's not included in that guide. So I'm just curious what sort of financial impact we should be anticipating with the shutdowns of the PO/SM facilities and are you awaiting a return in demand before you bring those facilities back up? Any more color there would be very helpful.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Very good question, Frank. And of course, I mean, like we have done last year as well. We don't call this, let's say, cost savings, but I mean, we call this, I mean, we look at what is happening in the marketplace. You know that with our PO/TBA capacities and especially the new one that we have rather seen successfully. We have the lowest cost and also lowest carbon footprints, propylene upsides in the world. So it's clear, I mean, that the PO/SM facilities are more kind of playing a role of a swing capacity. So with that, I will hand over to Kim to give more details.\nKimFoley : Frank. Thank you, Peter. Let me just add a little bit more color, as Peter alluded to, when we provide the guidance, the guidance was really to help investors understand the difference of bringing on this new PO/TBA capacity and relative to the other capacity that we would be taking offline for maintenance. And we really looked at that from the PO/TBA technology. So that you can see both the PO impacts as well as the oxyfuel impacts because they're almost offsetting, which is what you see in the guidelines. We talked about a 50% run rate for the new plant versus the maintenance of the other assets. So when you ask about what's the impact of the PO/SM market or assets going down, I think the way to think about it is where is styrene today. Styrene is oversupplied, it's changing month-to-month on very, very thin margins. So what -- how I would answer your question, Frank, is I don't think there is an impact based on PO demand of those plants idling at this point in time based on the durable demand for polyurethanes regionally as well as globally.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley.\nVincent Andrews : Question within your wide range of EBITDA guidance, you have sort of a single point targets for operating rates. So I'm just wondering how you're thinking about operating rates given they fluctuated a fair amount a lot more than normal over the past 12 months. And so what are you solving for with those operating rates versus the profitability you're seeing?\nMichael McMurray : It's pretty simple, Vincent. We're matching supply to demand. I wouldn't say it any other way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mike Leithead with Barclays.\nMike Leithead : Question on O&P EAI. Historically, if I look back, this business did about $1 billion or more of annual EBITDA. And now it seems like profitability is likely going to be a bit below that for some time, just given energy dynamics and some of the new supply that's coming on in Asia. So just if we take a step back, how are you thinking long term about the competitiveness and profitability of your assets there?\nPeter Vanacker: Yes, Ken, I mean, if you can take that question?\nKen Lane: Yes. So listen, of course, the headwinds in the European business with energy like everybody else has. And we're focused on generating the highest value from those assets because there are things that we can do through our VEP program that still does generate good value from a margin standpoint. We've seen probably the biggest headwind in Europe around demand. So volume is down pretty significantly year-over-year. As you can imagine, the whole inflation equation has hit the consumer very hard in Europe. So we believe we've got good competitive assets there. But of course, we're operating at a very difficult market. We're going to look for ways to continue to improve the value that we can get from those assets. In the longer term, we're always looking at our portfolio, and we'll continue to do so and make sure that we have the most competitive position that we can with reasonable amounts of capital that we would have to deploy there.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH.\nMatthew Blair : I had a question on just the longer-term PE outlook. Some of the consultants are showing global capacity growth in about the 2.5% range for 2024 through 2026, which, as you know, is about half of what we've seen recently. And so my question is, do you -- what are your expectations? Do you believe this forecast? Do you think this number will creep up? Or is it too late to really see any meaningful increase in like the 2024 and 2025 numbers, specifically.\nPeter Vanacker: Well, Matthew, I mean, normally, you have quite a good visibility. I mean, with the announcements of capacity increases. So -- and that visibility in our industry is normally around what, 4, 5 years, I mean, down the road. I would be very surprised, I mean, if there would certainly be additional capacities that come on stream. I mean, within that period that have not been announced because that's not how the industry is working. I mean, Ken, with regards, I mean, to the announcements now as the supply and demand.\nKen Lane: I -- the only thing I would add to that, Peter, is we have seen some projects starting to slow down, right? So we are hearing about that in the market. And look, I'll remind you, too, we always get into these down cycles, and it happens every time. And it feels like you're going to be here forever but there will be capacity that also comes out of the market. So yes, there are some additions that are going to come. And some of those are going to make sense depending on their feedstock position and the region that they're in, but there are going to be some capacities that come out. It takes a couple of years for that to happen, but that's how the cycle works. So in the short term, I don't expect there to be any significant change in capacity coming on. But in the midterm, I do think you're going to see some projects start to be slowed down.\nPeter Vanacker: And then if you look at it, I mean, from the demand side, if you look into the history, than with the financial crisis 2008 and 2009, then certainly in 2009 and 2010, you had a big recovery. So growth was higher than it normally is, let's say, over the cycle, let's say, around, I mean, 4% per year. And the same we've seen, I mean also with the pandemic, I mean, pandemic in 2021. During the second year, you saw a recovery with -- when you compare that to 2020. So I mean, we continue to be just looking, I mean, from a historic point of view. We have a consumer behavior. It could very well be that also then we see in the future that there's going to be higher demand compared to, I mean, to the average over the cycle demand growth of about 4% per year on polyethylene.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Roberts : Will the delay in closing the refinery pushback the time frame to achieve the $1 billion EBITDA from circular plastics? I assume you're going to be later in converting some of the gasifiers and so forth at the location.\nPeter Vanacker: The clear answer on that is, John, no. It's not. I mean, our target remains, I mean unchanged in the circular and low-carbon solutions business as we have communicated on the Capital Markets Day and we have been evaluating that option, obviously, exactly if you did our Capital Markets Day, so it was on the radar screen.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan.\nJeff Zekauskas : I think a couple of years ago, in Advanced Polymer Solutions, you were earning about $300 million. And today, guess the quarterly run rate is about $1 billion, and maybe you're making $10 million in EBIT. What happened to that business? And in your forecast of $500 million in EBITDA from circular polymers, what EBITDA margin do you expect on that? Or what EBITDA margin does that number still --\nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you for the question. On the APS, I covered when we had the Capital Markets Day, I think we've really lost the focus on the business and our customers when we went through the integration. And we took out a lot of cost and synergy but this is a business that really requires this customer centricity. It's a project-based business. You have to have a really good growth pipeline and a very, very good service level and that's the recognition that I think from the whole integration that we made some mistakes and we really have not put together this transformation plan to deliver what this business can perform. And that's the journey that we're on. And I'm confident that we're going to deliver on it. We're making good progress. But it is a transformation, it will take up years.\nMichael McMurray : And then Jeff, it's Michael. One of the things that I'd add, if you're looking at current year results versus historic results, remember, at the start of this year, we removed 2 relatively significant businesses from the APS segment and put it back in O&P. So that's not an apples-to-apples comparison if you're looking at this year versus history, just as a reminder.\nPeter Vanacker: And to your question, I mean, on the circular business, Jeff. I mean the $500 million in -- by 2027 and then the $1 billion by 2030. When we talked about that on the Capital Markets Day, you know that we are talking about 2 million tons of target by 2030. The margins that we talked about, I mean, you can do the back of the [indiscernible] Calculation pretty much is incremental EBITDA on top of the EBITDA that we normally make, I mean, in our crackers. So it gives you a bit of guidance also here. I must say, I mean we're -- we look at the margins that we are creating, I mean, today with that business, you know that since we started the business, we have been able, I mean, to grow the business quite substantially. Of course, albeit, I mean, still at a low level compared to the overall volumes that we are having in the polyolefins. We see that the margins that we can capture or substantially higher than what we have said, I mean, at the Capital Markets Day. And again, it's a separate business that is being created. I keep repeating that. Like I said at the Capital Markets Day, with its own supply and demand that has its own value-based pricing mechanisms that we are positioning in the marketplace. So this is not a market where you have a polyolefin plus a premium type of approach.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global.\nHassan Ahmed : Just wanted to revisit the earlier question around polyethylene exports out of the U.S. Look, I mean, a lot of this capacity that's been coming online in the U.S. has been with an eye to the export markets. And as you guys and others have talked about, the European market isn't looking great. Asia hasn't rebounded the way one would have expected it to. So I mean, are you seeing a scenario where some of that product that was meant for the export market isn't making its way to the export markets and potentially is putting further downward pressure on PE pricing in the U.S.?\nPeter Vanacker: One of the things, Hassan, that we have seen already since the end of last year, and this has maybe also a bit to do, I mean, with some learnings out of running a business like that in a pandemic environment, is that there has been substantially more disciplined in the marketplace. So just like we, as a leader in the industry, have reduced, I mean, the output instead of pushing products into the market. Others have done, I mean, the same thing. So you see a change, in my view, in terms of behavior compared, I mean, to the history. Ken, anything you want to add?\nKen Lane: I completely agree with that. And like I had mentioned before, there will be headwinds with this capacity coming on. There always is. But the capacity comes on one time and then you feel it and the market will adjust to that. I also said earlier, we're seeing some strength in some of the export markets, especially going south. So we're starting to see some growth in some markets like Brazil that's going to help absorb some of that capacity. So I'm not any more concerned about it now than I was 6 months ago. Southeast Asia is even looking a little bit better. We've seen that trend over the last couple of months. So the markets are going to absorb it over time. And like Peter said and Michael had said, we'll adjust our operating rates to optimize cash.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments.\nPeter Vanacker : Okay. Thank you very much. As usual, very thoughtful questions. We're looking forward to sharing the updates on our progress towards unlocking additional value, of course, over the coming months and we wish you all a great weekend. And as usual, stay safe. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter 2023 results. Starting with Slide 3. During today's call, we will discuss the resilient results that our team delivered during the challenging marketing conditions of the second quarter. And we will also provide an overview of our outlook for the second half of this year as well as our plans to optimize our advantaged positions to navigate volatile markets and feedstock costs. But first, let's take a few moments to review LyondellBasell's foundations and the progress we have made with our long-term strategy. Let's turn to Slide 4 and begin the discussion with our foundational commitment to leadership and safety performance. Our team continues to deliver outstanding safety results. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.15. While slightly higher than our results for 2022, our focus on safety continues to deliver performance that exceeds the top 75th percentile for our industry. Our leading safety results produce benefits that are reflected in our operations and ultimately, in our financial performance. Safety is a fundamental part of our core values and it will continue to be a critical enabler for our strategy and our future success. Let's turn to Slide 5 and review the progress on our long-term strategy. As we shared during our Capital Markets Day in March, our strategy is built around 3 pillars: grow and upgrade the core, build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business and step up performance and culture. We are confident we have the right strategy, and we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress. Let me highlight some of our actions on these pillars over the past few months. Our value enhancement program is providing benefits for 2 of the pillars in our strategy. The VEP is generating volume growth as part of grow and upgrade the core and margin improvement captured within step up performance and culture. I am pleased to see the rapid progress and execution of these VEP initiatives. We are raising our 2023 VEP target for year-end annual recurring EBITDA run rate by $50 million to $200 million based on mid-cycle margins to reflect our accelerated progress. I will provide more details on this progress in a few minutes. In grow and upgrade the core, we are investing in our business that fits with our long-term strategy. Last quarter, we announced a successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This quarter, our team successfully completed technology performance tests to prove out the full capacity of the new facility. We're also managing our portfolio to ensure that all businesses are aligned with our long-term strategy. In May, we announced that we are extending our refining operations to no later than the first quarter of 2025. Let me be clear, we have not changed our decision to exit the refining business. The extension of operations will allow us to develop options to redeploy the site's workforce and assets in support of the company's sustainable growth strategy. Now let's turn to the second pillar of our strategy. We're committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business to drive our leadership in circularity and address the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. We expect this business will generate at least $0.5 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion of incremental EBITDA by 2030. Through multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements, we are building a comprehensive business model with powerful competitive advantages that come from new technologies, [indiscernible] sources of recycled and renewable feedstocks and downstream relationships with our customers and brand owners. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Last October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve our line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. We're leveraging the structure of our VEP to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. And Torkel and his team were making solid progress on transforming the performance of our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Altogether, the 3 pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to provide focus and alignment to drive our progress in capturing value and delivering a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. Let's turn to Slide 6 and take a closer look at our approach to establishing leadership in circular solutions. As [Devon] stated at our Capital Markets Day in March, our circular and low-carbon solutions business is taking a differentiated approach by gaining advantage in 3 key areas: technologies, feedstocks and downstream customer relationships. We believe that our comprehensive strategy based on regional health will establish LyondellBasell as the leader in sustainable solutions. We're expanding our participation further up and down the plastic waste value chain to both gain scale and maximize the returns of various waste streams around the world. Today, our team is building supply chains to bring feedstocks into our existing facilities and driving innovation through investments in new technologies. As you saw on the previous slide, we are investing in both internal and external technologies such as LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced recycling process as well as Pryme's pyrolysis process and LMF Nord's mechanical recycling. In line with our sustainability goals, we are advancing our carbon reduction initiatives through partnerships. In June, we signed an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric cracker demonstration unit in Channelview, Texas. We have completed power purchase agreements to support the development and procurement of renewable power for LyondellBasell's locations around the world. These partnerships utilize the unique strengths of each party to deliver superior results with a common goal, reducing the carbon intensity of our products to increase the value of our products for our customers. And we are leveraging the unique capabilities of our APS segment to upgrade our mechanical recycling portfolio while offering tailored solutions for our customers. Most importantly, we are building a business that provides these solutions at scale. Step by step, we are making progress toward our 2030 goal to sell 2 million tons of recycled or renewable-based polymers annually. Since 2019, we have produced and marketed approximately 220,000 tons of these polymers. LyondellBasell's differentiated approach uniquely positions us to unlock significant value as we address the needs of our customers and society. On Slide 7, we ask that you save the date for a webinar on September 26, with Jim Seward, EVP and Chief Innovation Officer; and Yvonne van der Laan, EVP of circular and low-carbon solutions will share more details on our MoReTec technology and our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We hope that you can join us virtually. Let's turn to Slide 8 and discuss this year's updated target for our value enhancement program. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. Since the launch of our VEP, we have inspired a more agile and entrepreneurial mindset throughout our workforce. When we launched the value enhancement program last year, we announced targets to deliver recurring annual EBITDA improvements, run rates of $150 million by the end of 2023 and $750 million by the end of 2025. Our team is progressing ahead of plan for 2023. As we expanded the VEP to Europe and smaller U.S. sites during the first and second quarter, we found the enthusiasm and energy gaining momentum. We now think our recurring annual EBITDA improvement will reach a run rate of at least $200 million by the end of 2023. Let's get a bit more specific about a few of these VEP initiatives on Slide 9. At our low-density polyethylene manufacturing facilities in Clinton, Iowa, our team faced recurring reliability challenges related to valve controllers. With an investment of approximately $60,000, our team was able to upgrade the controllers and unlock more than $400,000 of annual value. The project was executed during a planned outage with VEP providing the resources required to rapidly resolve this chronic issue. Modest investment across our global engineering and procurement teams unlocked an opportunity to expand the supplier pool for electric motors at our manufacturing sites. We expect a direct annual cost benefit of $400,000 as well as an improvement in the security of our supply for these critical motors. These benefits will be realized with a total resource investment of only $70,000 over the next 3 years. At our Channelview facility, we invested the engineering resources required to implement a new process control scheme to improve yields and decrease energy consumption and distillation towers. Through better steam control and increased butadiene yields, we will realize $1.4 million in annual value at a onetime cost of $50,000. In addition to the direct financial benefits, this project supports our sustainability goals by reducing CO2 emissions by over 9 kilotons. One of our larger VEP initiatives will install a filtration system to remove solids from a byproduct stream at our olefins plant in Channelview. By upgrading the byproducts, we anticipate over $5.1 million in recurring annual EBITDA improvement from higher margins and increased utilization through a modest $550,000 investment. These examples are representative of the hundreds of initiatives in our VEP portfolio. The average annual benefit of our initiative is less than $1 million. But the program is supported by rigorous economic analysis, diligent tracking and an evergreen process. The value enhancement program has been the catalyst within our organization to rapidly implement good ideas to create value. We look forward to providing you with regular updates on our progress as these initiatives become more prominent in our results. Let's turn to Slide 10 and focus on our financial results for the second quarter. During the second quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results and strong cash generation despite challenging market conditions. Earnings were $2.44 per share. EBITDA was $1.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, our cash on hand was $2.5 billion with $6.6 billion of available liquidity.  Now let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of our business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segments on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $79 million reflected higher licensing revenue and lower catalyst volumes. In the third quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will moderately improve. As a result, we estimate that the third quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the quarterly results seen in the first 3 quarters of 2022. As discussed in the previous earnings call, we expect that LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic recycling technology will be a key enabler for scaling up our circular and low-carbon solutions business. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant in Cologne, Germany is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and announced an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Please turn to Slide 20 and I will discuss the market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect that the challenging market conditions of the second quarter will continue for the remainder of the year. And the America's fundamental demand is stopped and we see cautious buying from our customers and consumers. Margins are expected to be pressured by near-term volatility in feedstock costs and new capacity. The potential for energy cost volatility and associated consumer caution looms over the European markets, despite moderation in feedstock and energy costs relative to 2022. In China, strength in Consumer Services has not been sufficient to offset slow recovery in durable goods, infrastructure and export activity. Markets are not reflecting much benefit from the initial stimulus measures. Demand for consumer packaging is stable, supported by the service industries. However, our customers continue to keep their inventory levels cautiously low. Building and construction markets are relatively flat with benefits from new housing starts offset by reduced sales and maintenance for existing homes as owners resist trading into higher mortgage rates. We're watchful for tailwinds in the United States from stimulus enabled by the Inflation Reduction Act, to be part of the infrastructure law and the CHIPS and Science Act. Demand from automotive market seems to be gaining momentum. However, there may be some headwinds from the typical downtime at OEMs in the third quarter. Oxyfuels and refining markets continue to see stable demand as refined product inventories remain low. At LyondellBasell, we optimize our well-positioned assets across the world. We will continue to align our operating rates with market demand and steered through all stages of the business cycle. Now let me summarize our second quarter outlook and our long-term strategy for our company with Slide 21. Our second quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value to our new strategy despite challenging markets. Margins for our O&P businesses moderately improved amid tipid demand. Although lower than the first quarter, our oxyfuels and refining margins remained above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. Cash generation in the second quarter was outstanding with $1.3 billion in cash from operations and an impressive cash conversion of 103% over the past 4 quarters. We returned $508 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we anticipate soft demands and additional polyolefins capacity in North America and Asia will lead to further margin compression. We expect LyondellBasell's third quarter EBITDA will be mid-teens to mid-20 percentage points lower than the second quarter. We remain watchful for near-term risks and opportunities across sectors and geographies. At our Capital Markets Day in March, we shared our excitement around our new forward strategy. And during the call today, we provided updates on our progress to capture incremental value across the 3 pillars of the strategy. I want to emphasize that we are not allowing current conditions to slow us down. Our value enhancement program has generated incredible energy and enthusiasm across our workforce, from frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers developing innovative solutions to sales and support teams serving our customers around the world. LyondellBasell VEP is unlocking value at an accelerating pace. We're making steady progress on our goal to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions. That's a very good question, Duffy. Let me hand it over to Ken on the olefins and polyolefins side. Thank you, Steve. Very good question that you're asking. I mean what we are doing here together with our partners is, first of all, developing the technology further into, let's call it, a semi industrial scale. So this is not replacing, but it is feeding into a cracker. Next to that, of course, we are following different other avenues in order to prepare ourselves, I mean, for more renewable hydrocarbons. And here, that's what we are looking at, at the refinery and how can we leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have. So there will not be one solution fits all is the key message, but we are playing, let's say, very broadly, being technology agnostic, and investing in the different types of technologies that eventually where we then would decide to invest in those technologies on an industrial scale. We're talking about 2013 plus in my view. Then, of course, there can be different solutions depending on where you are in the world. And here -- it's Peter. I mean just to add to that, I mean, in terms of the acquisitions, I mean, one needs to look at the Mepol acquisition, being at the boundary, the interface between circular and low-carbon solutions and then the APS business with the compounding. So Mepol has a very strong mechanical recycling position in those different markets, and that's what made it so attractive for us to do that acquisition. Yes. Maybe first of all, let me repeat what has been said in the prepared remarks is that we have an outlook, I mean, for Q3, which we believe will be mid mid-double digits, so mid-teens to mid-20s, lower in terms of EBITDA compared to [indiscernible] Q2. And why that relatively broad range still because as you know, I mean, we have a very broad portfolio of different products. And we've seen a bit of improvements in the refinery markets. On the one hand side, we continue to believe, I mean, that we will have strong oxyfuel margins as Kim mentioned in the prepared remarks. But then, of course, I mean, with the volatility that you see in the olefins and polyolefins markets and then China still not being back as it should be at this point in time right now. So we will then, of course, fine-tune that towards more at the end of the quarter. When you Michael will speak on a conference, and then we'll give a further update on where we are standing, I mean, in that quarter. So with that, I mean, on the O&P maybe answer that question as well. I mean, Ken, if you can give some additional? Yes, Aleksey, I mean, we have seen a couple of areas where that eventually could have an impact. But at this point in time, it's too premature to say, I mean how much that impact will be. Our people, as you know, they are on the ground, I mean, following that. There seems to talks around, I mean, automotive industry, talks about white goods industry, but too premature, I mean, to say because we need -- we've seen a couple of these initiatives so far, but we are rather in a wait-and-see position now and ready. I mean, if the market would see, I mean, an uptick because all the initiatives so far have not had the impact as we would have hoped despite the fact, I mean, that the saving rates of individuals is extremely high, I mean, in China. Yes. Very good question, Frank. And of course, I mean, like we have done last year as well. We don't call this, let's say, cost savings, but I mean, we call this, I mean, we look at what is happening in the marketplace. You know that with our PO/TBA capacities and especially the new one that we have rather seen successfully. We have the lowest cost and also lowest carbon footprints, propylene upsides in the world. So it's clear, I mean, that the PO/SM facilities are more kind of playing a role of a swing capacity. So with that, I will hand over to Kim to give more details. Yes, Ken, I mean, if you can take that question? Well, Matthew, I mean, normally, you have quite a good visibility. I mean, with the announcements of capacity increases. So -- and that visibility in our industry is normally around what, 4, 5 years, I mean, down the road. I would be very surprised, I mean, if there would certainly be additional capacities that come on stream. I mean, within that period that have not been announced because that's not how the industry is working. I mean, Ken, with regards, I mean, to the announcements now as the supply and demand. And then if you look at it, I mean, from the demand side, if you look into the history, than with the financial crisis 2008 and 2009, then certainly in 2009 and 2010, you had a big recovery. So growth was higher than it normally is, let's say, over the cycle, let's say, around, I mean, 4% per year. And the same we've seen, I mean also with the pandemic, I mean, pandemic in 2021. During the second year, you saw a recovery with -- when you compare that to 2020. So I mean, we continue to be just looking, I mean, from a historic point of view. We have a consumer behavior. It could very well be that also then we see in the future that there's going to be higher demand compared to, I mean, to the average over the cycle demand growth of about 4% per year on polyethylene. The clear answer on that is, John, no. It's not. I mean, our target remains, I mean unchanged in the circular and low-carbon solutions business as we have communicated on the Capital Markets Day and we have been evaluating that option, obviously, exactly if you did our Capital Markets Day, so it was on the radar screen. And to your question, I mean, on the circular business, Jeff. I mean the $500 million in -- by 2027 and then the $1 billion by 2030. When we talked about that on the Capital Markets Day, you know that we are talking about 2 million tons of target by 2030. The margins that we talked about, I mean, you can do the back of the [indiscernible] Calculation pretty much is incremental EBITDA on top of the EBITDA that we normally make, I mean, in our crackers. So it gives you a bit of guidance also here. I must say, I mean we're -- we look at the margins that we are creating, I mean, today with that business, you know that since we started the business, we have been able, I mean, to grow the business quite substantially. Of course, albeit, I mean, still at a low level compared to the overall volumes that we are having in the polyolefins. We see that the margins that we can capture or substantially higher than what we have said, I mean, at the Capital Markets Day. And again, it's a separate business that is being created. I keep repeating that. Like I said at the Capital Markets Day, with its own supply and demand that has its own value-based pricing mechanisms that we are positioning in the marketplace. So this is not a market where you have a polyolefin plus a premium type of approach. One of the things, Hassan, that we have seen already since the end of last year, and this has maybe also a bit to do, I mean, with some learnings out of running a business like that in a pandemic environment, is that there has been substantially more disciplined in the marketplace. So just like we, as a leader in the industry, have reduced, I mean, the output instead of pushing products into the market. Others have done, I mean, the same thing. So you see a change, in my view, in terms of behavior compared, I mean, to the history. Ken, anything you want to add? Okay. Thank you very much. As usual, very thoughtful questions. We're looking forward to sharing the updates on our progress towards unlocking additional value, of course, over the coming months and we wish you all a great weekend. And as usual, stay safe. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 11 and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash conversion. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.8 billion of cash from operating activities. Our cash balance was $2.5 billion at the end of the second quarter. Our team efficiently converted 103% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. Let's continue with Slide 12 and review the details of our cash allocation during the second quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains committed to our balanced capital allocation strategy while providing strong returns for our shareholders. During the second quarter, our portfolio of businesses generated $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our robust cash generation comfortably covered our capital expenditures of approximately $300 million as well as our $500 million of returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. During the quarter, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5% to $1.25 per share. 2023 will mark our 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. In May, we issued our first green bond to support investments that advance our strategy for leadership in sustainability. After the start-up of our new PO/TBA facilities in the first quarter, we successfully demonstrated full operating rates on these assets. Our capital expenditures are now focused on continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects. With the rapid progress in the value enhancement program and the extension of operations at our refinery, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will increase to $1.7 billion, $100 million higher than our original guidance of $1.6 billion. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets. 75% for our European olefins and polyolefins and intermediates and derivative assets and just below 95% for our refinery. In the appendix of the slide deck, we provide updated 2023 modeling guidance, CapEx and several other items, including refresh estimates on cost and capital expenditures associated with extending the operations at our refinery business. Now I'd like to provide an overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 13. The LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter. Our results reflect modest improvements in O&P margins and higher I&D volumes, offset by weaker refining margins. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from lower feedstock costs. Demand for oxyfuels remained strong, while margins in our refining business declined due to lower refining crack spreads.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken? And then what I would remind investors is that the fourth quarter is typically seasonally weak to the third. Just as a reminder. It's pretty simple, Vincent. We're matching supply to demand. I wouldn't say it any other way. And then Jeff, it's Michael. One of the things that I'd add, if you're looking at current year results versus historic results, remember, at the start of this year, we removed 2 relatively significant businesses from the APS segment and put it back in O&P. So that's not an apples-to-apples comparison if you're looking at this year versus history, just as a reminder."
        },
        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Kim Foley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased $46 million in the second quarter to $472 million. Additional capacity from our new propylene oxide facility was largely offset by planned maintenance downtime. Propylene oxide and derivative margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Demand for oxyfuels remains strong when margins were slightly lower. In line with the guidance from the beginning of the year, we are conducting planned maintenance during the third quarter on 2 of our existing propylene oxide assets. We expect to run our global I&D assets at approximately 75% of capacity in the third quarter, which includes the idling of 2 PO/SM assets in the U.S. and Europe for approximately 2 months at each asset. In the second half of the year, we expect oxyfuel margins to compress as cost seasonally increase for butane are key raw material. Last quarter, we discussed the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA plant. This quarter, I'm pleased to report that we have completed the technology performance test to prove out the full capacity of our new PO/TBA facilities. I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished to quickly reach these milestones. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the Refining segment. The second quarter EBITDA declined by approximately $200 million to $114 million as the benchmark Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads settled by more than $9 a barrel relative to the first quarter. Spreads for other heavy crude oil run at our refinery, such as the Canadian WCS declined further than Maya, providing additional headwinds to our margins. In the near term, we expect demand for refined products to remain stable and inventories to remain low. The recent elevation of crack spreads will likely moderate as outages in the refining industry are resolved. Nonetheless, we expect Maya 2-1-1 spreads to remain above historical averages. In the third quarter, we plan to operate the refinery at approximately 93% of capacity. This rate provides optimal economics for our asset based on our plans for crudes, products and operations ahead of our maintenance work. We remain committed to the safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability. In the fourth quarter, we are planning for FCC maintenance with an estimated EBITDA impact of $25 million. We are extending operations at our refinery to no later than the first quarter of 2025. This extension will help to bridge activities at the site as we develop new projects to transform site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy.  With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Frank. Thank you, Peter. Let me just add a little bit more color, as Peter alluded to, when we provide the guidance, the guidance was really to help investors understand the difference of bringing on this new PO/TBA capacity and relative to the other capacity that we would be taking offline for maintenance. And we really looked at that from the PO/TBA technology. So that you can see both the PO impacts as well as the oxyfuel impacts because they're almost offsetting, which is what you see in the guidelines. We talked about a 50% run rate for the new plant versus the maintenance of the other assets. So when you ask about what's the impact of the PO/SM market or assets going down, I think the way to think about it is where is styrene today. Styrene is oversupplied, it's changing month-to-month on very, very thin margins. So what -- how I would answer your question, Frank, is I don't think there is an impact based on PO demand of those plants idling at this point in time based on the durable demand for polyurethanes regionally as well as globally."

            "name": "Ken Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 14 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the second quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $138 million to $679 million. North American integrated polyethylene margins increased on higher U.S. sales prices and lower ethane costs, while weak demand for durable goods continued to impact polypropylene margins. In the third quarter, we expect volatile feedstock costs and new capacity entering the market will compress margins. Also, demand is being impacted by cautious buying by our customers due to the uncertain economic outlook. As Peter mentioned, we are not allowing current business conditions to slow our progress on strategy. On June 1, we announced an MOU with Technip and Chevron Phillips to develop an electric furnace demonstration unit at our Channelview, Texas site. The technology could enable the company to use renewable electricity as a heat source for ethylene cracking and significantly reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of our olefins production. This collaboration is just one of many initiatives underway to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business for LyondellBasell. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the second quarter, European ethylene margins benefited from lower feedstock costs but this was offset by weak demand for polymers used in durable products. As a result, O&P EAI second quarter EBITDA increased $7 million to $84 million. Looking ahead, we expect the European and Asian markets to remain challenging with consumer uncertainty and energy cost volatility. Slow economic recovery, combined with additional supply in China will continue to be a headwind. Finally, we are growing our portfolio of recycled and renewable based polymers from consolidating our ownership in QCP mechanical recycling, investing in Pryme's plastic waste pyrolysis process, and building a flexible packaging recycling facility through LMF Nord, our CLCS team continues to build out our regional hub model to advance our leadership in circular and renewable solutions. Having said that, I want to emphasize the focus our team has on generating value and cash from operations. Our team is highly seasoned and is doing a great job at both. I want to be sure and acknowledge all of their hard work.  Now I'll turn the call over to Kim. Yes, Chris, thanks for the question. Like we have said in the remarks that we made, we do expect it to be volatile. So the good news is we've seen NGL prices come down. NAV was really peaking in July, but we do see that coming off here in August, but it did have an impact in July. That's not going to continue. The inventory levels for NGLs are still very healthy and production is growing. So overall, we expect that we're going to see advantages with NGL production here in the U.S., especially with ethane. Now having said that, we still do have a lot of new supply that's coming into the market. And at the end of the second quarter, we saw prices in the Americas coming down and that's going to continue into the third quarter, let's say, it's going to carry into the third quarter. We've seen some green shoots in the export market. So I think we're kind of bouncing along the bottom here. But it's just going to support that theme of continued volatility going forward. What I would expect is that we're going to see that normal seasonality going into the fourth quarter, some weakness on volumes. Q1 will typically be a little bit better. And then when we get into the second half of next year is when I expect to start to see things really improve. Duffy. Yes, so listen, we have traditionally been lower in terms of a percentage for exports in our portfolio, and you see that this year. Now some of that as well is driven by the turnaround that we've had in the first half of the year. We've got some of our capacity down right now in the Midwest. So we've been a little bit lower on the export sales in the first half of the year. As an industry, the Americas or the U.S. typically is exporting somewhere around 35% to 40% of the capacity. Normally, when these new assets come online, you're looking at them exporting significantly above that level for the first year or so as they work their way into the market. But I don't see any change in the midterm around the industry being at that 40% level of exports, but it's always our goal to find the highest value for our products. And that is in the domestic market. So our focus is on serving the customers here and building out a portfolio that is more resilient by supplying domestic. Yes, like I had said previously, we're looking at the feedstock kind of peaked in July. So that definitely is going to hurt us versus Q2, if you think about it sequentially. Also, like I said, with prices coming down in the U.S. at the end of Q2, that's carried into Q3, so both of those are going to be headwinds. Then there is some volume component to that. Q2 is normally our peak fall in terms of seasonality and in Q3, especially in Europe, in the summer months, you start to see the volume slow down. So we will have some volume slowdown in Q3 as well. Overall, I expect that we are, like I said, bumping along here on margins in Q3 in terms of being at the bottom. Yes. So listen, of course, the headwinds in the European business with energy like everybody else has. And we're focused on generating the highest value from those assets because there are things that we can do through our VEP program that still does generate good value from a margin standpoint. We've seen probably the biggest headwind in Europe around demand. So volume is down pretty significantly year-over-year. As you can imagine, the whole inflation equation has hit the consumer very hard in Europe. So we believe we've got good competitive assets there. But of course, we're operating at a very difficult market. We're going to look for ways to continue to improve the value that we can get from those assets. In the longer term, we're always looking at our portfolio, and we'll continue to do so and make sure that we have the most competitive position that we can with reasonable amounts of capital that we would have to deploy there. I -- the only thing I would add to that, Peter, is we have seen some projects starting to slow down, right? So we are hearing about that in the market. And look, I'll remind you, too, we always get into these down cycles, and it happens every time. And it feels like you're going to be here forever but there will be capacity that also comes out of the market. So yes, there are some additions that are going to come. And some of those are going to make sense depending on their feedstock position and the region that they're in, but there are going to be some capacities that come out. It takes a couple of years for that to happen, but that's how the cycle works. So in the short term, I don't expect there to be any significant change in capacity coming on. But in the midterm, I do think you're going to see some projects start to be slowed down. I completely agree with that. And like I had mentioned before, there will be headwinds with this capacity coming on. There always is. But the capacity comes on one time and then you feel it and the market will adjust to that. I also said earlier, we're seeing some strength in some of the export markets, especially going south. So we're starting to see some growth in some markets like Brazil that's going to help absorb some of that capacity. So I'm not any more concerned about it now than I was 6 months ago. Southeast Asia is even looking a little bit better. We've seen that trend over the last couple of months. So the markets are going to absorb it over time. And like Peter said and Michael had said, we'll adjust our operating rates to optimize cash."

            "content": "Thank you, Kim. Let's review the second quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 18. Second quarter EBITDA moderately increased to $34 million. Margins for the polypropylene company business increased as product prices improved and energy costs decreased. We saw lower demand from the construction and electronics markets, while demand from the automotive markets gained momentum during the quarter. We expect demand in the third quarter to be similar to the second quarter across most APS businesses. Typical third quarter downtime at OEMs will offset some of the automotive production gains we have seen in the first half of 2023 in Europe and North America. Our number 1 priority in APS is to restore service levels to our customers and restore growth in the business. I'm happy to report that we have restored our service levels, and we're making good progress in refilling our growth pipeline. APS has a lot of project-based business and our growth pipeline depends on winning a spot on the next automotive platform launch with the next color design. One KPI that we track is the number of color and concentrate request we service. In Europe, the number of requests increased by more than 50% by the end of the second quarter relative to our performance in the second half of 2022. We still have a long path to complete our transformation, but our team is making tangible progress in delivering improved results. In early July, we completed our acquisition of the Mepol Group, a manufacturer of recycled high-performing technical compounds located in Italy and Poland. Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our strategy to be the leader in providing sustainable solutions for our customers. With that, I will turn the call back to Peter. Thank you. So as we communicated, our target is to get the business to what we believe is very feasible that the $0.5 billion earnings by 2027. And that's the plan that we have embarked on. And I have to say we are at the current moment right as I expect us to be. I've led multiple business transformations, and this is where I expect us to be at this time. So if you look at our earnings performance, I think fourth quarter of last year was the bottom, and we have then 2 months behind us where we are gradually improving it, but it is a multi-year effort for us and we're feeling the growth pipeline, as I mentioned, is our number 1 priority, and we're making good progress, but that also takes time. But it is our focus. In terms of acquisitions, the Mepol, I think, was an acquisition that perfectly fit in, but there is nothing else that we have that we are in that sort of category for our space at the moment. Thank you for the question. On the APS, I covered when we had the Capital Markets Day, I think we've really lost the focus on the business and our customers when we went through the integration. And we took out a lot of cost and synergy but this is a business that really requires this customer centricity. It's a project-based business. You have to have a really good growth pipeline and a very, very good service level and that's the recognition that I think from the whole integration that we made some mistakes and we really have not put together this transformation plan to deliver what this business can perform. And that's the journey that we're on. And I'm confident that we're going to deliver on it. We're making good progress. But it is a transformation, it will take up years."

During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, David. Welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We will begin on Slide number 3 with our safety performance. Our workforce continues to deliver excellent safety performance for the start of 2023. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.16, which continues to be below the rate seen in prior years. Safety will continue to be a fundamental part of our core values as we move forward with the implementation of our exciting new strategy. Let's turn to Slide number 4 and review the new strategy that we launched last month at our Capital Markets Day. As you can see, much work was already underway. Our strategy is built around three pillars. We're convinced that the successful implementation of our new strategy will increase our normalized EBITDA by $3 billion to $10 billion by 2027. This should ultimately result in a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. The three pillars for growing and upgrading our core, building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business; and finally, stepping up our performance and culture. And the grow in upgrading the core, we are focused on the areas of our portfolio where we have leading positions and competitive advantages that are aligned with our long-term goals. We will reinvest to grow and improve upon those advantaged positions by leveraging our leading technologies to generate returns at scale. In the second pillar, we are committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business that would enable our leadership in circularity and address the massive customer demand for these products and solutions in a profitable way. We expect this business will generate at least $1 million of incremental EBITDA by 2030. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. We have established a value enhancement program that is prioritizing and delivering on these initiatives. Our value enhancement program is on track to deliver more than $750 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. These three pillars do not stand alone. The pillars of our strategy are interconnected and reinforce each other. For example, we step up our performance and culture to create value. We will reinvest that value in growing and upgrading our core. Returns from a larger and more profitable core will be allocated to build a more sustainable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And the cash generation from all these activities will continue to provide generous shareholder returns. Our strategy serves the needs of our customers, employees, investors and society. We did not wait until our Capital Markets Day in March to start executing this strategy. Slide number four highlights our actions across three pillars over the past year. As part of growing and upgrading the core, we announced in April 2022 that we would exit the refining business. We are now evaluating options to transform the facility to serve our long-term objectives, particularly around circular and low-carbon solutions. Last April, we divested our Australian polypropylene business and at our Capital Markets Day, we announced a strategic review for our ethylene oxide & derivatives business. We are improving our focus with investments in businesses that fit with our long-term strategy. An example is the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world over the past month. This project was an enormous undertaking across two Houston area facilities. During the height of construction, we had a workforce of more than 3,000 people. This is the sixth PO/TBA plant built by LyondellBasell since inventing the technology in the 1960s. Our plant doubles the scale of our prior plans, improves yields, increases product recovery and incorporates hundreds of design improvements that save energy, reduce emissions and lower costs. The net result is that we believe propylene oxide from our PO/TBA technology has a lower carbon footprint relative to the most widely used PO technologies. And our cost of production is the lowest in the world. The new plant was producing on-spec products at rates of 70% or above within one month from start-up. I want to sincerely thank our team for all the hard work and dedication that went into this extremely successful launch of a new production capacity. The PO/TBA plant is just one example of how we are growing and upgrading our core businesses. Through our value enhancement program, our team is unlocking additional production volumes across our business portfolio through hundreds of initiatives to increased capacity and improve reliability. In the second half of last year, we established our circular and low-carbon solutions business unit to address the rapidly growing demand for circular and renewable products. Since that time, we have staffed up the organization and announced multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements. Just this week, we announced that LyondellBasell will acquire the other half of our QCP mechanical recycling joint venture in Europe. This is another step forward in our work to achieve our sustainability goals. We are securing recycled and renewable feedstocks and building regional hubs to leverage our technologies and provide powerful advantages for our comprehensive business model. Last December, we increased our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals to establish a leadership position within our industry by aligning with science-based climate guidance. As part of this, we set a goal to procure at least half of our global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In just 10 months, we've announced agreements that will achieve 70% of our renewable power target with approximately 1,100 megawatts of renewable generation capacity. The agreements will reduce LyondellBasell's greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1.1 million tons, and that is nearly 15% of our 2020 Scope 2 emissions. We provide an in-depth look at our progress on sustainability with our newly published 2022 sustainability report. And as you know, that is available on our website. This report highlights how we can create substantial enterprise value through leadership in sustainability, which is core to our strategy of creating solutions for everyday sustainable living. Our work to step-up performance and culture is the third pillar of our strategy. In October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. And at our Capital Markets Day, Torkel Rhenman describes the work that is underway to transform our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In addition, we are leveraging the structure of our value enhancement program to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. Altogether, the three pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to form a growth engine that captures value and delivers a more profitable and sustainable portfolio of businesses. Let's now turn to slide number five to discuss our financial performance. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered solid results, reflecting moderately improving market conditions. Earnings were $2.50 per share, more than 90% at best our fourth quarter results. EBITDA was $1.5 billion, and we generated nearly $500 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the quarter with $1. 8 billion of cash on hand and $5.8 billion of available liquidity. Our company generated 12% return on invested capital over the past 12 months. The strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enable us to confidently move forward with our strategy, while continuing to provide attractive returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash generation. In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated nearly $500 million of cash from operating activities that contributed toward our total of $5.1 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash balance was $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Over the last four quarters, our team efficiently converted 89% of our EBITDA into cash. During the first quarter, our cash conversion dipped to 35% driven by increased sales volumes and additional inventory required to serve customers during upcoming maintenance. Nonetheless, we expect to continue converting approximately 80% of EBITDA to cash over the longer term, as we have done in the past. We remain committed to delivering returns to our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we returned $3.5 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let's continue with slide seven and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the past four quarters, we returned 107% of free cash flow to our shareholders. This is well above the annual target of 70% that I shared with you at our Capital Markets Day. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividends and share repurchases. First quarter capital expenditures were $352 million, approximately $120 million less than the fourth quarter. With a successful start-up of our world-scale PO/TBA plant, capital expenditures related to the construction of the plant will be replaced with growing cash generation. Our continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects remain within our plan of $1.6 billion for 2023. Now, I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on slide eight. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect moderate margin and volume improvements across most segments due to improving global demand and lower energy costs. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from higher asset utilization. Demand for fuels remained strong, and our oxyfuels and refining businesses continued to earn margins above historical averages. Please note that our first quarter segment results reflect the movement of our Catalloy and polybutylene businesses from the APS segment to the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, effective as of January 1st. We filed an 8-K on March 7th that provides summary historical financial information for the three prior years. During the quarter, we recognized $69 million in cost related to the exit from a refining business and a non-cash goodwill impairment of $252 million related to our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to incur approximately $75 million of EBITDA impact as well as $55 million of depreciation related to the exit from our refining business during each quarter of 2023. As a follow-up to our 2023 plant maintenance guidance, we decided to pull forward some planned maintenance in our O&P Americas segment to the second quarter. We expect this will result in an additional impact of $90 million for a total estimated EBITDA headwind of $110 million for the segment during the second quarter of 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on slide nine with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the first quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $157 million to $541 million. North American Olefins margins improved on lower feedstock costs, while polyethylene margins increased on higher pricing. In the second quarter, we expect slightly better seasonal demand leading to modest improvements in volume and margins. The recent start-up delays for new industry polyethylene capacity should tighten markets and benefit margins over the coming months. Costs for feedstocks and energy are expected to remain relatively low during the summer season. LyondellBasell will continue to manage operating rates in line with moderately improving demand We expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at a rate of approximately 85% in the second quarter. This is inclusive of the additional planned maintenance mentioned by Michael. In February, we announced a new long-term feedstock agreement with Nexus Circular. This will supply LyondellBasell's low-carbon solutions business unit with 24,000 tons per year of recycled feedstock. Nexus Circulars new facility will convert mixed plastic waste into recycled liquid feedstock for our ethylene crackers, ultimately producing new plastics under the circular revived brand. This agreement is just one component of our rapid multifaceted strategy execution. We'll now turn to slide 10 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, we increased operating rates after the restart of our integrated cracker in France. European margins benefited from lower energy costs, but weak demand for durable products persisted. As a result, O&P EAI first quarter EBITDA increased $225 million to $77 million. Looking ahead, we expect slightly better seasonal demand in the second quarter. Our operating rates will reflect that improvement, targeting approximately 85% of capacity for the O&P EAI assets. While Europe remains a challenging environment, especially for durable goods, we are focusing on serving customers and optimizing our assets to deliver highest value. As we mentioned at our recent Capital Markets Day, our teams continue to make good progress developing our regional hub model for circular and low-carbon solutions. Through a fit-for-purpose diverse mix of products and technologies, we will scale this up to become a leader in circular and renewable solutions. With that, let's turn to slide 11 to discuss the hub model in more detail, the first of which will be located in Cologne, Germany. As [indiscernible] described at our Capital Markets Day, our business model was built upon an integrated approach to plastic waste. This begins upstream with advanced waste sorting through our joint venture with Source One Plastics and partnership with EEW Energy from Waste, both of which focus on recovering plastic waste that would otherwise be incinerated. From there, we can utilize our mechanical recycling footprint with our QCP and APK investments, which can be sold under the Circulen recover brand or move further down the value chain into compounding where we can leverage our APS segment and the newly acquired Mepol Group to create additional value. Alternatively, these waste sorting operations can take hard to recycle plastic waste to create feedstock for advanced recycling. Newly developed technologies such as our catalytic Mortech process, allow for waste to be converted into pyrolysis oil. In addition to our Mortech technology, which we hope to FID later this year, we are utilizing long-term feedstock agreements with suppliers like Nexus Circular. This pyrolysis oil from advanced recycling is the feedstock for our ethylene crackers. Most importantly, it allows us to produce materials identical to virgin resins under our CirculenRevive brand. This generates meaningful value for our customers that use polyethylene and polypropylene in applications such as healthcare, where mechanically recycled plastic waste cannot be used. Lastly, renewable feedstocks are another sustainable option for our ethylene crackers. Through suppliers such as Neste, we are able to process feedstocks from bio-based sources such as waste and residual oils and fats to produce CirculenRenew polymers with a low-carbon footprint. Advanced recycling and renewables are excellent feedstock sources for ethylene crackers. Both are similar to naphtha or heavier liquids, making LyondellBasell well-positioned to capture this value with the feedstock flexibility of our existing assets. All of this is already underway, and our hub model will allow us to scale globally and reach at least 2 million tons per year of recycled and renewable based products by 2030. Since 2019, we have sold nearly 200,000 tons of products. We are convinced that LyondellBasell is uniquely positioned to be the supplier of choice for our customers and brand owners who want to partner with us to lower their greenhouse gas footprint and make their products more circular. We see tremendous value across the entire value chain, and we will continue building on our momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim.\nKim Foley : Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 12 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased by $135 million in the first quarter to $426 million. Propylene oxide volumes increased with higher operating rates after planned downtime last quarter, while margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Oxyfuel margins remained strong, supported by low inventories and steady demand for gasoline. Overall, we operated our assets at approximately 85% for the quarter. As highlighted at our Capital Markets Day in March, we have successfully started up our new PO/TBA plant, which is the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This start-up was many years in the making, and I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. In line with the guidance from last quarter, a heavy planned maintenance schedule across our propylene oxide assets in 2023 will largely offset the benefits from this new volume during the first year of operations. In 2023, we'll be focused on driving safety, quality and reliability as we fine-tune the operation of this new PO/TBA plant and ramp up cash generation in 2024. For the second quarter, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 80% of capacity in line with demand. Our new PO/TBA capacity is included in the calculation of our I&D segment operating rates beginning with the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA of $315 million was fairly comparable with the prior quarter, which benefited from a $40 million in tailwinds from a LIFO inventory valuation. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread remained stable at about $49 per barrel. Industry inventories for fuels remain low following winter weather and significant maintenance, coupled with stable demand. We operated the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 226,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to moderate due to declining diesel spreads while remaining well above historical averages. We plan to operate the refinery at approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter. We remain committed to safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability to capitalize on current market conditions. As Peter mentioned earlier, we have started the evaluation of several projects to transform the site to fit with our circular and low-carbon solution strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman : Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the first quarter results on Slide 14. First quarter EBITDA increased $52 million to $26 million. Margins for the polypropylene compounding business improved, as product sales prices captured a higher share of rising raw material prices. All of our business areas saw moderately higher demand. We expect demand will moderately improve across most APS businesses during the second quarter. After spending time in this role, I've met with many customers who have told us how much they value our products and innovations. We're working every day to improve our service levels and meet our customers' needs to transform this business. As we mentioned last quarter, we have reshaped APS by moving the Catalloy and polybutane businesses into the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, which will allow us to focus on what is core to APS, serving customers with tailored solutions. To further support the growing and shaping of APS core, we announced in March that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mepol Group. Mepol\u2019s expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our overall strategy to be a leading provider of sustainable solutions. We are confident that our APS platform has significant potential. While our team will have some autonomy to install a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives. With that, I will return the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. First quarter EBITDA of $73 million reflected stable catalyst volumes and lower licensing revenue. In the second quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will be moderately better. Nonetheless, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the first quarter. As Ken discussed, we believe that LyondellBasell's circular and low-carbon solutions business has a strategic advantage with our integrated hub solution. A key enabler to scale our hubs is LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic-recycling technology. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Let me now summarize our first quarter and the outlook for our company with slide 16. Our first quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value through our new strategy with help from moderately improving market conditions. LyondellBasell's foundational commitment to safety remains at the core of our culture and will continue to be a critical enabler for our future success. Our O&P businesses benefited from moderately improving demand. Our oxyfuels and refining businesses continue to see margins above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate modest seasonal demand improvements. North American polyethylene margins should benefit from delays in industry capacity additions. In response, we're aligning our operating rates to match market demand. We remain watchful for market improvements in China, as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during the second half of the year. LyondellBasell is focused on serving rapidly growing demand for our valuable circling products from our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We're entering multiple arrangements to secure plastic waste feedstocks and build out the regional apps that will drive our advantage. And we are making progress on our climate targets in less than one year since signing our first power purchase agreements, we achieved 70% of our target to procure at least half of global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. At our Capital Markets Day last month, I hope you sense our excitement around our new forward strategy. Last week, we gathered 150 of our global leaders to provide feedback and align on implementation. The energy and enthusiasm around our initial progress is incredible. From our frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers, developing innovative solutions for our customers to three pillars of our strategy for providing focus and clarity for our progress to capture incremental value and deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine at LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: Yes. Thank you. This FID that you're targeting at the end of the year for the MoReTec technology, is it fair to assume that you're thinking about building this at the refinery site, given you have all these hydrotreaters available that could be used to treat the pyrolysis oil, you could also use the hydrotreaters to make your own renewable feedstock rather than buying it from Neste and you need a lot of hydrogen to do all this. Could this site become a hydrogen hub as well and get some DOE funding.\nPeter Vanacker: Hi Steve, this is Peter. Thank you for your question. Of course, as usual, very good question. The first MoReTec industrial scale deployments that we are referring to the -- we plan to have an FID until the end of this year will be in the Cologne hub. But of course, we're also looking at the Houston hub, and I have alluded to that before, that we are looking at the refinery to also deploy an investment in terms of MoReTec our own technology. So -- but the first one, to be very clear, will be in Cologne. And rightfully so, I mean, as you recognized, if we do a MoReTec investment in the Houston hub, we can leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have there to upgrade a plastic oil and then feed the plastic oil through the pipeline to our Channelview cracker. So, it's an ideal situation that we have there. So that's the focus that we currently have. It's all around, our MoReTec advanced recycling technology.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeff Zekauskas: Thanks very much. What are the total cash costs for shutting down the refinery and remediating whatever needs to be remediated if there is something?\nMichael McMurray: Hey, Jeff, it's Michael. Let me help you out with that. So I'll refer you back to an 8-K that we issued last year. But we anticipate a number of charges. So there's charges associated with the existing operating lease assets. So this would include like tanks and other infrastructure. There's asset decommissioning cost, so like things like tank cleaning and then personnel-related costs as well and then some miscellaneous charges. So our total cost estimate -- and this is still a good estimate today. We had given a range of about $600 million to $900 million. It's unlikely and this is happening, that they're not going to be recognized all at once, so we've been incurring some cash and some non-cash costs now largely non-cash this year, and they'll continue into 2024 as well. And you're seeing charges per quarter right now of about $85 million, similar to what we had seen in 2023 as well. On the fourth quarter, we did raise our estimate on asset decommissioning costs slightly, and you've seen some incremental depreciation related to that. But that's within our $1.4 billion estimate for the full year. And then don't forget, there will be a meaningful working capital release when we shut down the refinery -- it's on the order of about $700 million is what we're expecting.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMike Sison: Hey, good morning, guys. Nice start to the year. In terms of fundamental polyethylene demand, where do you think we're running at here in the first quarter, heading into the second quarter and -- and how do you think it holds up in the second half of the year?\nPeter Vanacker: Yeah, Mike, I'm going to give that Ken to answer that question. The first thing that I want to say is, our sales teams as well as the operations team, they have done an excellent job in navigating very well both in polyethylene as well as in polypropylene through challenging market environments. And the result is, of course, what you see then on the EBITDA in Q1. Ken?\nKen Lane: Yeah. Thanks, Mike. We're seeing modest improvements from Q4. Q4 being very low, and we saw a lot of destocking, especially in Europe in the fourth quarter. So I'd say overall demand is going to modestly improve going into Q2. We typically see some seasonal improvement. We have begun to see some improvement in China. The consumer is sort of waking up there. So my expectation is that as we get into the second half of the year, that's probably going to be the biggest opportunity for improvement in the market is going to be how quickly China comes back I don't think in Europe and in the US, you're going to see anything different than the normal kind of Q2, Q3 peak and then a decline in Q4, which is normal for those markets. But we should see Asia performing stronger in the second half.\nPeter Vanacker: And I'll hold that in the context, of course, if you just look at Eurozone GDP first quarter, that was practically no growth, okay, not a deep recession, but on the other hand side, I mean, 0.1% growth. And needless to say, as you hear it all over the place is that this is especially in durable goods that the market continues to see a very conservative consumer behavior.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nDuffy Fischer: Yes. Good morning. I was just trying to figure out in your PO business, your non -- other than the new plant you're starting up, roughly, what are you running the rest of your fleet at? And then what do we need to see for PO to get healthier? Do we need to see some industry shutdowns, or do we just need to see business come back to a normal level and the profitability levels per unit can kind of come back to where they were maybe 1 year, 1.5 years ago. But just what's your outlook there for the rest of the year, if you would produce?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Duffy. Very good question. And that allows me again to repeat what a huge success that is to be able to start up that PO/TBA plants. I mean the largest that is in the entire industry, on time, safely and is now ramping up just like inset to demonstrate, I mean maximum capacity in that plant. So really, I mean, an incredible -- and I must say, even when I compare that to my previous assignments and other companies, I've never seen it going that move. So really a great job by the entire team, which gives you Kim some time to answer the question.\nKim Foley: As it relates to the business environment, I think it's very similar to what you heard from Ken and Peter related to durable demand. The biggest outlets for propylene oxide are polyurethanes that go into insulation, they go into furniture, they go into the construction industry, paintings and coatings. So until we see housing turn you're going to -- the demand is going to be weak. And the question is what's going to happen with interest rates and how will that influence housing demand, not only in the US, but also some of the challenges that they have in Asia, as far as their construction and real estate markets. So as we look forward, we have some optimism, but I think it's heavily weighted on what happens with interest rates. To your other question as it relates to industry consolidation, yes, we would love to see some consolidation from fourth quartile assets around the world, but those are decisions that each and every manufacturer has to look at and make as they assess their portfolio.\nPeter Vanacker: And Duffy, that a part of the PO consumption is going into bedding into furniture. But there is also a part that is going about, I would say, 20% is going into automotive. And if you look at the automotive industry in terms of builds, the latest the IHS numbers were, let's say, April expectation, close to 4% increase. So it's not all negative. But as long as we don't see that the construction market will start to pick up, then we expect that it will be moderate in terms of demand growth in PO, but we are ready for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJosh Spector: Yes. Hi. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on one of the earlier questions on demand and specifically around China in terms of what you're seeing in terms of on-the-ground demand and inventories for polyethylene and polypropylene. And you made a comment on, I mean, your prepared remarks around delays in polyethylene capacity in North America being helpful. I mean, at least on paper, there's capacity coming out in China at meaningful scale. Is there anything you could comment on there that's going perhaps per plant slower or faster than you expected? Thanks.\nPeter Vanacker : Ken?\nKen Lane : Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. No, there's nothing that we see really meaningfully different in terms of the developments around China capacity additions. They seem to be coming on about the way that we had expected. So really nothing new there. But again, what we're starting to see is consumption is improving, converters and downstream customers are being a little bit more careful. They're not wanting to build inventory. So that's part of what we see in terms of, I'd say, the slow ramp-up. They're being very risk-averse, but the demand is beginning to come back a little bit as far as consumer goods. To the point that Peter made earlier, durables are less strong in terms of the recovery, but we still see good demand in food packaging and those sorts of markets.\nPeter Vanacker : Can we say, Ken, I mean, if you look at just at March, export from the U.S., that went up as well?\nKen Lane : Yes. So exports from North America have gone up in the in the month of March pretty significantly, if you look at the ACC data. So that's going to continue, I think, into the second quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter : Thank you. Peter, can you talk to the strength of the oxyfuels margins and how sustainable it might be beyond the seasonally stronger period we're about to enter?\nPeter Vanacker : Yes. Thank you, David. Good question. We continue to believe, I mean, that the oxyfuels markets, if you look at it compared to the history, will continue to be strong. Maybe a little bit. But I will give it to you Kim, to elaborate a little bit more.\nKim Foley : Thanks, Peter. So I think if you think about the big drivers for the profitability of oxyfuels, at your feedstock costs, so look at your butane costs versus your crude. Look at your cost of methanol, which right now in the U.S. is favorable with low natural gas, the relative price of crude, so the higher crude is, the more favorable it is because it's the difference between the lower gas and the crude. And then the premium. And I think that's the question many people have is what's going to happen with all this new capacity as we come into the market with the -- what we call the oxyfuel for the ether premium. And we're pretty confident we have outlets for all of that material. And we think there'll be some seasonal moderation of margins as we go into the third and fourth quarter as butane pricing increases, but no concerns or plans that we haven't forecasted within our portfolio.\nPeter Vanacker : Yes. One needs to look like I said in the prepared remarks, I mean the new PO/TBA plant, even if we would write at 90%, 95% of capacity, we have actually proactively scheduled three turnarounds at other plants. So at the end, net-net, there is not substantial more volume that comes into the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a question on your Cologne hub slide. First, there's mechanical recycling that's present in the diagram -- and as you know, there is a very well-developed mechanical recycling industry that already exists. Do you have any special sauce or advantage by owning the mechanical recycling assets and having them on that one site?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, we do believe, and it's a very good question, I mean, Aleksey, and rightfully noted as well that this is -- as we said at the Capital Markets Day, this is the who breadth of different technologies that we are deploying globally, not just at the Cologne hub. And one of those technologies is actually the mechanical recycling technologies. And you saw from our announcement this morning that we have agreed to me to buy out and now have full ownership over the QCP assets, which are assets in Galena in the Netherlands as well as the Tekova assets in Belgium. So these assets are on one hand side, industrial mechanical waste focus, and on the other hand side was consumer waste focused. So again, here, we have the breadth of technologies that we then can bring to the market. We do believe that we have differentiated technology not just on the mechanical of course, as you know, but also on the advanced recycling and intend to continue to deploy that.\nKen Lane: And just -- one thing I do want to add to that is when you look at the resins that we develop and the mechanical recycling capability that we have, being able to optimize those things. So -- if you think about some of our new resins coming out of the Hyperzone asset, they are very good to be able to increase the recycled content. So there is an advantage by optimizing your portfolio of virgin resins and recycle it content.\nPeter Vanacker: Yeah, that's a very important point. And that's why, I mean, this a approach, the synergies that we have, the optimization that is possible to maximize the value out of our waste.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you, and good morning, everyone. I'm wondering if you can give us a bit of a bridge in EAI from 1Q into 2Q and a couple of questions within that. One would just be on the energy cost position of the plant footprint. I know you said it was $90 million better versus 4Q. Does that improve any further into the second quarter? And then also, you commented in the release about in the first quarter, I believe it was 70% naphtha as a feedstock. What was the reason why you were so rich in naphtha versus LPG? And what would you anticipate for the second quarter?\nPeter Vanacker: I'll take that one, Vincent. Thanks for the question. So just to give you a feel, recall that we had in the fourth quarter, the -- our French cracker down. So that certainly has an impact on our energy mix and our feedstock mix as well. I think what was interesting in the first quarter is that propane was in the feedstock mix, which is atypical when you think about winter months normally propane is not in the feedstock mix. And we have a lot of flexibility in that cracker in France. So as we were ramping that up, we started to optimize the portfolio through the quarter. So you'll see some more impact. Lets say the full quarter impact of having the bar cracker up and running in the second quarter, but I'd say it's marginal. We do have a good cost position in terms of energy costs in France. So I don't expect there to be a big difference in the second quarter versus first quarter, other than what you can see in the improving price of gas in Europe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Skowronski with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Skowronski: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Ken, ethane prices have fallen quite a bit, can you provide color on your outlook for feedstock costs for the rest of the year? And also, now that we're at the end of the month, where do you expect North American polyethylene prices to settle in April?\nKen Lane: Sure, Matthew. So we are in a really good position, as you can imagine, for North American feedstock advantage, the oil and gas ratio is very strong. Our outlook is that that's going to continue. We've seen good increases in production in North America in NGLs. And if you look at ethane and propane inventories, they're at high levels and production continues, so I expect that we're going to see in the midterm continued strength in the advantage for North America. And like we said in the prepared statement, the -- some of the delays in the production issues that are happening with the North American capacity that's coming on, should continue to lend support to polyethylene pricing. And we've got price increase announcements out there. And certainly, we're optimistic that we'll be able to secure for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. Just to follow up on the prior question. Can you comment on the demand side of polyethylene? Do you think that destocking has run its course at this point? And if so, would you anticipate any restocking in coming months? And then with regard to the new supply that's coming domestically, it seems that, as you alluded to, there's either delays or we've also heard that some units are having trouble running on specs sustainably. So welcome any color you have along those lines for the market or individual grades of resin?\nPeter Vanacker: Ken?\nKen Lane: Yes. Sure. So listen, I'll just continue. Nothing really more to add. We are seeing tightness in some market segments more than others, which is things like high-density polyethylene, you've probably heard the issues around some of the tightness in the markets there. We expect that's going to continue, but not a lot really to add. These things are a little bit hard to predict. And exports, like we had mentioned earlier, did creep up in March, and that's always going to be one of the key factors in terms of new capacity coming on with the feedstock advantage that we have here, a lot of that new capacity is going to go offshore. And we're not faced with any of the supply chain issues like what we were seeing in the early fourth quarter those issues are gone. So the ability to move product offshore is going to help sort of evacuate that volume fairly quickly.\nMichael McMurray: Ken, we think destocking is largely done, but folks are buying cautiously, right?\nKen Lane: Yes, yes. I would say destocking, we don't really see that occurring anymore and people are being cautious in terms of their inventory levels.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Arun Viswanathan with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nArun Viswanathan: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just a question on how you're thinking about the year and maybe next year as well. We appreciate the '27 $10 billion number. But if you just look into the rest of this year, you were able to do the 1.5 for Q1 on EBITDA. [indiscernible], a little bit better, and you're still talking about weak demand. So I'm assuming there's a little bit of improvement as we go through the middle of the year. That should put you on a pace of around $6 billion. Next year, you have, unfortunately, the refinery out, which maybe is a loss of $1 billion. How do you -- are some of those kind of ways of thinking about Lyondell accurate? And how do you kind of plan to plug that $1 billion hole for next year? Thanks.\nPeter Vanacker: Hi, Arun, good question. Thank you very much. And of course, in the context of not giving guidance on a yearly basis. I mean, we alluded already, I mean, to the fact that we see maybe a little bit of movement in China but not substantially. So that will be a very important factor to look at if and it's a big if, during the second half of this year, demand growth would be there in China on a substantial basis. And the other point, I mean, we expect, I mean, that energy costs were going to be, let's say, relatively modest, of course, a big advantage that can leverage upon in the United States. Energy costs have gone down in Europe. But of course, we all know that they are still -- energy is still very expensive in Europe. But we don't see immediately from today's perspective that energy costs in Europe would certainly return back means that like we had gas price above \u20ac130, \u20ac140 per megawatt hour that we have seen at the end of 2022. So China continues to be a big question mark. And then how will the inflation influence consumer behavior in Europe as well as in the United States.\nMichael McMurray: So to put a bow around that, Peter, we think the second half should be better than the first half. That's broadly in line with what the analyst community is thinking as well. But as you said, China is the linchpin and uncertainty generally is high right now.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Blair: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. On natural gas, I think you've given sensitivity that every dollar per MMBtu is about $175 million of op costs. Did you realize all those benefits in Q1 from both lower US as well as lower European gas prices? And I guess, should we expect any sort of incremental benefit heading into Q2?\nPeter Vanacker: Michael?\nMichael McMurray: Sure. Happy to take that question. And we got some feedback from a few folks that they didn't like our rule of thumb. So I'll give you a bit more data this morning, which hopefully is helpful. But as you all know, energy prices last year surged significantly, both in Europe and the US. And so just looking at energy cost for last year versus 2021, up about $1.7 billion. If you benchmark last year versus 2020, up $3.3 billion. So we faced into some significant energy cost increases over the last couple of years. But obviously, have seen relief that started in the fourth quarter and has followed through into the first quarter of this year and now is continuing into the second quarter. So -- what I would say is that if you looked at energy cost overall for the fourth quarter for the enterprise, about $1 billion overall, in the first quarter, down roughly $200 billion. Our expectation as we move into Q2, that it's largely flattish, maybe a little bit of kind of full quarter effect. And then just from a modeling perspective, I'll give you a couple of more data points to be helpful both around North American average natural gas prices that we incurred and then Europe average natural gas prices. So for North America, average price in the fourth quarter was $5 -- roughly $5.30 per MMBtu. In the first quarter, the average was $3.10 roughly 3.10. And then for Europe, fourth quarter was $26.70, and in the first quarter was $16.60. So hopefully, those data points will help you all as you kind of think about the balance of the year from a modeling perspective.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nHassan Ahmed: Good morning, Peter. I wanted to revisit a series of questions that you guys obviously got on polyethylene supply additions. I mean if I were to sort of dig deeper into the different grades of polyethylene there seem to be fairly major divergences in those capacity adds. Meaning, if I take a look at LDPE, the capacity adds are fairly tepid versus HD and LL. So how do you see that sort of playing out in the near to medium term?\nPeter Vanacker: Ken?\nKen Lane: Thank you for the question, Hassan. I mean like I said before, we've seen this capacity coming for several years. There's not anything really new here. You're exactly right, linear low and high-density capacity has really been differentially higher coming online than low density. But it doesn't change our outlook. We know -- if you go back to the fourth quarter, we really did hit sort of the bottom of the cycle at that point. And now as growth begins to come back in the market, that's going to absorb that capacity. We will sometime in the next several years, get back to a more normalized level of earnings. So not really anything new to add to that. These are things that happen, and we just we have to work through that in the marketplace.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our time allowed for questions. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you very much, everybody. As usual, excellent questions, very thoughtful questions. We, of course, look forward to sharing our progress in delivering LyondellBasell strategy and unlocking additional value over the coming months. I wish you all a great weekend, and as usual, stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, David. Welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter 2023 results. We will begin on Slide number 3 with our safety performance. Our workforce continues to deliver excellent safety performance for the start of 2023. LyondellBasell's year-to-date incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.16, which continues to be below the rate seen in prior years. Safety will continue to be a fundamental part of our core values as we move forward with the implementation of our exciting new strategy. Let's turn to Slide number 4 and review the new strategy that we launched last month at our Capital Markets Day. As you can see, much work was already underway. Our strategy is built around three pillars. We're convinced that the successful implementation of our new strategy will increase our normalized EBITDA by $3 billion to $10 billion by 2027. This should ultimately result in a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. The three pillars for growing and upgrading our core, building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business; and finally, stepping up our performance and culture. And the grow in upgrading the core, we are focused on the areas of our portfolio where we have leading positions and competitive advantages that are aligned with our long-term goals. We will reinvest to grow and improve upon those advantaged positions by leveraging our leading technologies to generate returns at scale. In the second pillar, we are committed to building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business that would enable our leadership in circularity and address the massive customer demand for these products and solutions in a profitable way. We expect this business will generate at least $1 million of incremental EBITDA by 2030. The third pillar of our strategy is to step up our performance and culture. Our company has a well-earned reputation for strong operational excellence and cost leadership. Our goal is to build on these strengths to capture untapped value across the company through modest investments. We have established a value enhancement program that is prioritizing and delivering on these initiatives. Our value enhancement program is on track to deliver more than $750 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. These three pillars do not stand alone. The pillars of our strategy are interconnected and reinforce each other. For example, we step up our performance and culture to create value. We will reinvest that value in growing and upgrading our core. Returns from a larger and more profitable core will be allocated to build a more sustainable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And the cash generation from all these activities will continue to provide generous shareholder returns. Our strategy serves the needs of our customers, employees, investors and society. We did not wait until our Capital Markets Day in March to start executing this strategy. Slide number four highlights our actions across three pillars over the past year. As part of growing and upgrading the core, we announced in April 2022 that we would exit the refining business. We are now evaluating options to transform the facility to serve our long-term objectives, particularly around circular and low-carbon solutions. Last April, we divested our Australian polypropylene business and at our Capital Markets Day, we announced a strategic review for our ethylene oxide & derivatives business. We are improving our focus with investments in businesses that fit with our long-term strategy. An example is the successful start-up of our new PO/TBA facility, the largest propylene oxide plant in the world over the past month. This project was an enormous undertaking across two Houston area facilities. During the height of construction, we had a workforce of more than 3,000 people. This is the sixth PO/TBA plant built by LyondellBasell since inventing the technology in the 1960s. Our plant doubles the scale of our prior plans, improves yields, increases product recovery and incorporates hundreds of design improvements that save energy, reduce emissions and lower costs. The net result is that we believe propylene oxide from our PO/TBA technology has a lower carbon footprint relative to the most widely used PO technologies. And our cost of production is the lowest in the world. The new plant was producing on-spec products at rates of 70% or above within one month from start-up. I want to sincerely thank our team for all the hard work and dedication that went into this extremely successful launch of a new production capacity. The PO/TBA plant is just one example of how we are growing and upgrading our core businesses. Through our value enhancement program, our team is unlocking additional production volumes across our business portfolio through hundreds of initiatives to increased capacity and improve reliability. In the second half of last year, we established our circular and low-carbon solutions business unit to address the rapidly growing demand for circular and renewable products. Since that time, we have staffed up the organization and announced multiple acquisitions, partnerships and other arrangements. Just this week, we announced that LyondellBasell will acquire the other half of our QCP mechanical recycling joint venture in Europe. This is another step forward in our work to achieve our sustainability goals. We are securing recycled and renewable feedstocks and building regional hubs to leverage our technologies and provide powerful advantages for our comprehensive business model. Last December, we increased our greenhouse gas emission reduction goals to establish a leadership position within our industry by aligning with science-based climate guidance. As part of this, we set a goal to procure at least half of our global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. In just 10 months, we've announced agreements that will achieve 70% of our renewable power target with approximately 1,100 megawatts of renewable generation capacity. The agreements will reduce LyondellBasell's greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 1.1 million tons, and that is nearly 15% of our 2020 Scope 2 emissions. We provide an in-depth look at our progress on sustainability with our newly published 2022 sustainability report. And as you know, that is available on our website. This report highlights how we can create substantial enterprise value through leadership in sustainability, which is core to our strategy of creating solutions for everyday sustainable living. Our work to step-up performance and culture is the third pillar of our strategy. In October, we streamlined our organizational structure to improve line of sight with clear accountabilities and improved alignment across our commercial and manufacturing functions. And at our Capital Markets Day, Torkel Rhenman describes the work that is underway to transform our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. In addition, we are leveraging the structure of our value enhancement program to drive commercial excellence and improve our customer focus. Altogether, the three pillars of LyondellBasell's strategy are working side by side to form a growth engine that captures value and delivers a more profitable and sustainable portfolio of businesses. Let's now turn to slide number five to discuss our financial performance. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered solid results, reflecting moderately improving market conditions. Earnings were $2.50 per share, more than 90% at best our fourth quarter results. EBITDA was $1.5 billion, and we generated nearly $500 million in cash from operating activities. We ended the quarter with $1. 8 billion of cash on hand and $5.8 billion of available liquidity. Our company generated 12% return on invested capital over the past 12 months. The strength of our investment-grade balance sheet and our disciplined approach to capital allocation enable us to confidently move forward with our strategy, while continuing to provide attractive returns to shareholders through all stages of the business cycle. With that, I will turn the call over to Michael first and then to each of our business leaders, who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to slide 15, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. First quarter EBITDA of $73 million reflected stable catalyst volumes and lower licensing revenue. In the second quarter, we expect that licensing revenue and catalyst volumes will be moderately better. Nonetheless, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar to the first quarter. As Ken discussed, we believe that LyondellBasell's circular and low-carbon solutions business has a strategic advantage with our integrated hub solution. A key enabler to scale our hubs is LyondellBasell's proprietary MoReTec advanced catalytic-recycling technology. Engineering work for our first commercial scale plant is underway. We hope to provide you with further updates and reach an investment decision for a commercial scale plant during the fourth quarter of this year. Let me now summarize our first quarter and the outlook for our company with slide 16. Our first quarter results illustrate how our team is capturing value through our new strategy with help from moderately improving market conditions. LyondellBasell's foundational commitment to safety remains at the core of our culture and will continue to be a critical enabler for our future success. Our O&P businesses benefited from moderately improving demand. Our oxyfuels and refining businesses continue to see margins above historical averages, supported by low inventories and steady demand. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million in dividends and share repurchases, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we anticipate modest seasonal demand improvements. North American polyethylene margins should benefit from delays in industry capacity additions. In response, we're aligning our operating rates to match market demand. We remain watchful for market improvements in China, as stronger economic activity could help drive recovery in global markets during the second half of the year. LyondellBasell is focused on serving rapidly growing demand for our valuable circling products from our circular and low-carbon solutions business. We're entering multiple arrangements to secure plastic waste feedstocks and build out the regional apps that will drive our advantage. And we are making progress on our climate targets in less than one year since signing our first power purchase agreements, we achieved 70% of our target to procure at least half of global electricity from renewable sources by 2030. At our Capital Markets Day last month, I hope you sense our excitement around our new forward strategy. Last week, we gathered 150 of our global leaders to provide feedback and align on implementation. The energy and enthusiasm around our initial progress is incredible. From our frontline operators and manufacturing to engineers, developing innovative solutions for our customers to three pillars of our strategy for providing focus and clarity for our progress to capture incremental value and deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine at LyondellBasell. We're now pleased to take your questions. Hi Steve, this is Peter. Thank you for your question. Of course, as usual, very good question. The first MoReTec industrial scale deployments that we are referring to the -- we plan to have an FID until the end of this year will be in the Cologne hub. But of course, we're also looking at the Houston hub, and I have alluded to that before, that we are looking at the refinery to also deploy an investment in terms of MoReTec our own technology. So -- but the first one, to be very clear, will be in Cologne. And rightfully so, I mean, as you recognized, if we do a MoReTec investment in the Houston hub, we can leverage upon the hydrotreaters and hydro crackers that we have there to upgrade a plastic oil and then feed the plastic oil through the pipeline to our Channelview cracker. So, it's an ideal situation that we have there. So that's the focus that we currently have. It's all around, our MoReTec advanced recycling technology. Yeah, Mike, I'm going to give that Ken to answer that question. The first thing that I want to say is, our sales teams as well as the operations team, they have done an excellent job in navigating very well both in polyethylene as well as in polypropylene through challenging market environments. And the result is, of course, what you see then on the EBITDA in Q1. Ken? And I'll hold that in the context, of course, if you just look at Eurozone GDP first quarter, that was practically no growth, okay, not a deep recession, but on the other hand side, I mean, 0.1% growth. And needless to say, as you hear it all over the place is that this is especially in durable goods that the market continues to see a very conservative consumer behavior. Thank you, Duffy. Very good question. And that allows me again to repeat what a huge success that is to be able to start up that PO/TBA plants. I mean the largest that is in the entire industry, on time, safely and is now ramping up just like inset to demonstrate, I mean maximum capacity in that plant. So really, I mean, an incredible -- and I must say, even when I compare that to my previous assignments and other companies, I've never seen it going that move. So really a great job by the entire team, which gives you Kim some time to answer the question. And Duffy, that a part of the PO consumption is going into bedding into furniture. But there is also a part that is going about, I would say, 20% is going into automotive. And if you look at the automotive industry in terms of builds, the latest the IHS numbers were, let's say, April expectation, close to 4% increase. So it's not all negative. But as long as we don't see that the construction market will start to pick up, then we expect that it will be moderate in terms of demand growth in PO, but we are ready for that. Ken? Can we say, Ken, I mean, if you look at just at March, export from the U.S., that went up as well? Yes. Thank you, David. Good question. We continue to believe, I mean, that the oxyfuels markets, if you look at it compared to the history, will continue to be strong. Maybe a little bit. But I will give it to you Kim, to elaborate a little bit more. Yes. One needs to look like I said in the prepared remarks, I mean the new PO/TBA plant, even if we would write at 90%, 95% of capacity, we have actually proactively scheduled three turnarounds at other plants. So at the end, net-net, there is not substantial more volume that comes into the market. Well, we do believe, and it's a very good question, I mean, Aleksey, and rightfully noted as well that this is -- as we said at the Capital Markets Day, this is the who breadth of different technologies that we are deploying globally, not just at the Cologne hub. And one of those technologies is actually the mechanical recycling technologies. And you saw from our announcement this morning that we have agreed to me to buy out and now have full ownership over the QCP assets, which are assets in Galena in the Netherlands as well as the Tekova assets in Belgium. So these assets are on one hand side, industrial mechanical waste focus, and on the other hand side was consumer waste focused. So again, here, we have the breadth of technologies that we then can bring to the market. We do believe that we have differentiated technology not just on the mechanical of course, as you know, but also on the advanced recycling and intend to continue to deploy that. Yeah, that's a very important point. And that's why, I mean, this a approach, the synergies that we have, the optimization that is possible to maximize the value out of our waste. I'll take that one, Vincent. Thanks for the question. So just to give you a feel, recall that we had in the fourth quarter, the -- our French cracker down. So that certainly has an impact on our energy mix and our feedstock mix as well. I think what was interesting in the first quarter is that propane was in the feedstock mix, which is atypical when you think about winter months normally propane is not in the feedstock mix. And we have a lot of flexibility in that cracker in France. So as we were ramping that up, we started to optimize the portfolio through the quarter. So you'll see some more impact. Lets say the full quarter impact of having the bar cracker up and running in the second quarter, but I'd say it's marginal. We do have a good cost position in terms of energy costs in France. So I don't expect there to be a big difference in the second quarter versus first quarter, other than what you can see in the improving price of gas in Europe. Ken? Hi, Arun, good question. Thank you very much. And of course, in the context of not giving guidance on a yearly basis. I mean, we alluded already, I mean, to the fact that we see maybe a little bit of movement in China but not substantially. So that will be a very important factor to look at if and it's a big if, during the second half of this year, demand growth would be there in China on a substantial basis. And the other point, I mean, we expect, I mean, that energy costs were going to be, let's say, relatively modest, of course, a big advantage that can leverage upon in the United States. Energy costs have gone down in Europe. But of course, we all know that they are still -- energy is still very expensive in Europe. But we don't see immediately from today's perspective that energy costs in Europe would certainly return back means that like we had gas price above \u20ac130, \u20ac140 per megawatt hour that we have seen at the end of 2022. So China continues to be a big question mark. And then how will the inflation influence consumer behavior in Europe as well as in the United States. Michael? Ken? Thank you very much, everybody. As usual, excellent questions, very thoughtful questions. We, of course, look forward to sharing our progress in delivering LyondellBasell strategy and unlocking additional value over the coming months. I wish you all a great weekend, and as usual, stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide six, and let me begin by describing how we are extending our track record of outstanding cash generation. In the first quarter, LyondellBasell generated nearly $500 million of cash from operating activities that contributed toward our total of $5.1 billion over the last 12 months. Our cash balance was $1.8 billion at the end of the first quarter. Over the last four quarters, our team efficiently converted 89% of our EBITDA into cash. During the first quarter, our cash conversion dipped to 35% driven by increased sales volumes and additional inventory required to serve customers during upcoming maintenance. Nonetheless, we expect to continue converting approximately 80% of EBITDA to cash over the longer term, as we have done in the past. We remain committed to delivering returns to our shareholders. Over the last 12 months, we returned $3.5 billion in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let's continue with slide seven and review the details of our cash generation and allocation during the first quarter. The LyondellBasell team remains focused on disciplined capital allocation to provide strong returns for our shareholders. During the past four quarters, we returned 107% of free cash flow to our shareholders. This is well above the annual target of 70% that I shared with you at our Capital Markets Day. During the first quarter, we returned approximately $460 million to shareholders through our quarterly dividends and share repurchases. First quarter capital expenditures were $352 million, approximately $120 million less than the fourth quarter. With a successful start-up of our world-scale PO/TBA plant, capital expenditures related to the construction of the plant will be replaced with growing cash generation. Our continued investments in maintenance and smaller growth projects remain within our plan of $1.6 billion for 2023. Now, I'd like to provide an overview of the results for each of our segments on slide eight. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.5 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Our results reflect moderate margin and volume improvements across most segments due to improving global demand and lower energy costs. Results in our olefins and polyolefins businesses benefited from higher asset utilization. Demand for fuels remained strong, and our oxyfuels and refining businesses continued to earn margins above historical averages. Please note that our first quarter segment results reflect the movement of our Catalloy and polybutylene businesses from the APS segment to the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, effective as of January 1st. We filed an 8-K on March 7th that provides summary historical financial information for the three prior years. During the quarter, we recognized $69 million in cost related to the exit from a refining business and a non-cash goodwill impairment of $252 million related to our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to incur approximately $75 million of EBITDA impact as well as $55 million of depreciation related to the exit from our refining business during each quarter of 2023. As a follow-up to our 2023 plant maintenance guidance, we decided to pull forward some planned maintenance in our O&P Americas segment to the second quarter. We expect this will result in an additional impact of $90 million for a total estimated EBITDA headwind of $110 million for the segment during the second quarter of 2023. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Hey, Jeff, it's Michael. Let me help you out with that. So I'll refer you back to an 8-K that we issued last year. But we anticipate a number of charges. So there's charges associated with the existing operating lease assets. So this would include like tanks and other infrastructure. There's asset decommissioning cost, so like things like tank cleaning and then personnel-related costs as well and then some miscellaneous charges. So our total cost estimate -- and this is still a good estimate today. We had given a range of about $600 million to $900 million. It's unlikely and this is happening, that they're not going to be recognized all at once, so we've been incurring some cash and some non-cash costs now largely non-cash this year, and they'll continue into 2024 as well. And you're seeing charges per quarter right now of about $85 million, similar to what we had seen in 2023 as well. On the fourth quarter, we did raise our estimate on asset decommissioning costs slightly, and you've seen some incremental depreciation related to that. But that's within our $1.4 billion estimate for the full year. And then don't forget, there will be a meaningful working capital release when we shut down the refinery -- it's on the order of about $700 million is what we're expecting. Ken, we think destocking is largely done, but folks are buying cautiously, right? So to put a bow around that, Peter, we think the second half should be better than the first half. That's broadly in line with what the analyst community is thinking as well. But as you said, China is the linchpin and uncertainty generally is high right now. Sure. Happy to take that question. And we got some feedback from a few folks that they didn't like our rule of thumb. So I'll give you a bit more data this morning, which hopefully is helpful. But as you all know, energy prices last year surged significantly, both in Europe and the US. And so just looking at energy cost for last year versus 2021, up about $1.7 billion. If you benchmark last year versus 2020, up $3.3 billion. So we faced into some significant energy cost increases over the last couple of years. But obviously, have seen relief that started in the fourth quarter and has followed through into the first quarter of this year and now is continuing into the second quarter. So -- what I would say is that if you looked at energy cost overall for the fourth quarter for the enterprise, about $1 billion overall, in the first quarter, down roughly $200 billion. Our expectation as we move into Q2, that it's largely flattish, maybe a little bit of kind of full quarter effect. And then just from a modeling perspective, I'll give you a couple of more data points to be helpful both around North American average natural gas prices that we incurred and then Europe average natural gas prices. So for North America, average price in the fourth quarter was $5 -- roughly $5.30 per MMBtu. In the first quarter, the average was $3.10 roughly 3.10. And then for Europe, fourth quarter was $26.70, and in the first quarter was $16.60. So hopefully, those data points will help you all as you kind of think about the balance of the year from a modeling perspective."

            "name": "Kim Foley",
            "content": "Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 12 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. EBITDA for the segment increased by $135 million in the first quarter to $426 million. Propylene oxide volumes increased with higher operating rates after planned downtime last quarter, while margins decreased on continued weak demand for durable goods. Oxyfuel margins remained strong, supported by low inventories and steady demand for gasoline. Overall, we operated our assets at approximately 85% for the quarter. As highlighted at our Capital Markets Day in March, we have successfully started up our new PO/TBA plant, which is the largest propylene oxide plant in the world. This start-up was many years in the making, and I am incredibly proud of what our team has accomplished. In line with the guidance from last quarter, a heavy planned maintenance schedule across our propylene oxide assets in 2023 will largely offset the benefits from this new volume during the first year of operations. In 2023, we'll be focused on driving safety, quality and reliability as we fine-tune the operation of this new PO/TBA plant and ramp up cash generation in 2024. For the second quarter, we expect to run our global IND assets at approximately 80% of capacity in line with demand. Our new PO/TBA capacity is included in the calculation of our I&D segment operating rates beginning with the second quarter. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results of the refining segment. First quarter EBITDA of $315 million was fairly comparable with the prior quarter, which benefited from a $40 million in tailwinds from a LIFO inventory valuation. In the first quarter, the Maya 2-1-1 spread remained stable at about $49 per barrel. Industry inventories for fuels remain low following winter weather and significant maintenance, coupled with stable demand. We operated the refinery at approximately 85% of capacity with an average crude rate of 226,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect the Maya 2-1-1 spreads to moderate due to declining diesel spreads while remaining well above historical averages. We plan to operate the refinery at approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter. We remain committed to safe operation of these assets with a focus on high reliability to capitalize on current market conditions. As Peter mentioned earlier, we have started the evaluation of several projects to transform the site to fit with our circular and low-carbon solution strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. As it relates to the business environment, I think it's very similar to what you heard from Ken and Peter related to durable demand. The biggest outlets for propylene oxide are polyurethanes that go into insulation, they go into furniture, they go into the construction industry, paintings and coatings. So until we see housing turn you're going to -- the demand is going to be weak. And the question is what's going to happen with interest rates and how will that influence housing demand, not only in the US, but also some of the challenges that they have in Asia, as far as their construction and real estate markets. So as we look forward, we have some optimism, but I think it's heavily weighted on what happens with interest rates. To your other question as it relates to industry consolidation, yes, we would love to see some consolidation from fourth quartile assets around the world, but those are decisions that each and every manufacturer has to look at and make as they assess their portfolio. Thanks, Peter. So I think if you think about the big drivers for the profitability of oxyfuels, at your feedstock costs, so look at your butane costs versus your crude. Look at your cost of methanol, which right now in the U.S. is favorable with low natural gas, the relative price of crude, so the higher crude is, the more favorable it is because it's the difference between the lower gas and the crude. And then the premium. And I think that's the question many people have is what's going to happen with all this new capacity as we come into the market with the -- what we call the oxyfuel for the ether premium. And we're pretty confident we have outlets for all of that material. And we think there'll be some seasonal moderation of margins as we go into the third and fourth quarter as butane pricing increases, but no concerns or plans that we haven't forecasted within our portfolio."

            "name": "Ken Lane",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on slide nine with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Americas segment. During the first quarter, O&P Americas EBITDA increased $157 million to $541 million. North American Olefins margins improved on lower feedstock costs, while polyethylene margins increased on higher pricing. In the second quarter, we expect slightly better seasonal demand leading to modest improvements in volume and margins. The recent start-up delays for new industry polyethylene capacity should tighten markets and benefit margins over the coming months. Costs for feedstocks and energy are expected to remain relatively low during the summer season. LyondellBasell will continue to manage operating rates in line with moderately improving demand We expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at a rate of approximately 85% in the second quarter. This is inclusive of the additional planned maintenance mentioned by Michael. In February, we announced a new long-term feedstock agreement with Nexus Circular. This will supply LyondellBasell's low-carbon solutions business unit with 24,000 tons per year of recycled feedstock. Nexus Circulars new facility will convert mixed plastic waste into recycled liquid feedstock for our ethylene crackers, ultimately producing new plastics under the circular revived brand. This agreement is just one component of our rapid multifaceted strategy execution. We'll now turn to slide 10 to review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, we increased operating rates after the restart of our integrated cracker in France. European margins benefited from lower energy costs, but weak demand for durable products persisted. As a result, O&P EAI first quarter EBITDA increased $225 million to $77 million. Looking ahead, we expect slightly better seasonal demand in the second quarter. Our operating rates will reflect that improvement, targeting approximately 85% of capacity for the O&P EAI assets. While Europe remains a challenging environment, especially for durable goods, we are focusing on serving customers and optimizing our assets to deliver highest value. As we mentioned at our recent Capital Markets Day, our teams continue to make good progress developing our regional hub model for circular and low-carbon solutions. Through a fit-for-purpose diverse mix of products and technologies, we will scale this up to become a leader in circular and renewable solutions. With that, let's turn to slide 11 to discuss the hub model in more detail, the first of which will be located in Cologne, Germany. As [indiscernible] described at our Capital Markets Day, our business model was built upon an integrated approach to plastic waste. This begins upstream with advanced waste sorting through our joint venture with Source One Plastics and partnership with EEW Energy from Waste, both of which focus on recovering plastic waste that would otherwise be incinerated. From there, we can utilize our mechanical recycling footprint with our QCP and APK investments, which can be sold under the Circulen recover brand or move further down the value chain into compounding where we can leverage our APS segment and the newly acquired Mepol Group to create additional value. Alternatively, these waste sorting operations can take hard to recycle plastic waste to create feedstock for advanced recycling. Newly developed technologies such as our catalytic Mortech process, allow for waste to be converted into pyrolysis oil. In addition to our Mortech technology, which we hope to FID later this year, we are utilizing long-term feedstock agreements with suppliers like Nexus Circular. This pyrolysis oil from advanced recycling is the feedstock for our ethylene crackers. Most importantly, it allows us to produce materials identical to virgin resins under our CirculenRevive brand. This generates meaningful value for our customers that use polyethylene and polypropylene in applications such as healthcare, where mechanically recycled plastic waste cannot be used. Lastly, renewable feedstocks are another sustainable option for our ethylene crackers. Through suppliers such as Neste, we are able to process feedstocks from bio-based sources such as waste and residual oils and fats to produce CirculenRenew polymers with a low-carbon footprint. Advanced recycling and renewables are excellent feedstock sources for ethylene crackers. Both are similar to naphtha or heavier liquids, making LyondellBasell well-positioned to capture this value with the feedstock flexibility of our existing assets. All of this is already underway, and our hub model will allow us to scale globally and reach at least 2 million tons per year of recycled and renewable based products by 2030. Since 2019, we have sold nearly 200,000 tons of products. We are convinced that LyondellBasell is uniquely positioned to be the supplier of choice for our customers and brand owners who want to partner with us to lower their greenhouse gas footprint and make their products more circular. We see tremendous value across the entire value chain, and we will continue building on our momentum. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Yeah. Thanks, Mike. We're seeing modest improvements from Q4. Q4 being very low, and we saw a lot of destocking, especially in Europe in the fourth quarter. So I'd say overall demand is going to modestly improve going into Q2. We typically see some seasonal improvement. We have begun to see some improvement in China. The consumer is sort of waking up there. So my expectation is that as we get into the second half of the year, that's probably going to be the biggest opportunity for improvement in the market is going to be how quickly China comes back I don't think in Europe and in the US, you're going to see anything different than the normal kind of Q2, Q3 peak and then a decline in Q4, which is normal for those markets. But we should see Asia performing stronger in the second half. Yes. Thanks for the question, Josh. No, there's nothing that we see really meaningfully different in terms of the developments around China capacity additions. They seem to be coming on about the way that we had expected. So really nothing new there. But again, what we're starting to see is consumption is improving, converters and downstream customers are being a little bit more careful. They're not wanting to build inventory. So that's part of what we see in terms of, I'd say, the slow ramp-up. They're being very risk-averse, but the demand is beginning to come back a little bit as far as consumer goods. To the point that Peter made earlier, durables are less strong in terms of the recovery, but we still see good demand in food packaging and those sorts of markets. Yes. So exports from North America have gone up in the in the month of March pretty significantly, if you look at the ACC data. So that's going to continue, I think, into the second quarter. And just -- one thing I do want to add to that is when you look at the resins that we develop and the mechanical recycling capability that we have, being able to optimize those things. So -- if you think about some of our new resins coming out of the Hyperzone asset, they are very good to be able to increase the recycled content. So there is an advantage by optimizing your portfolio of virgin resins and recycle it content. Sure, Matthew. So we are in a really good position, as you can imagine, for North American feedstock advantage, the oil and gas ratio is very strong. Our outlook is that that's going to continue. We've seen good increases in production in North America in NGLs. And if you look at ethane and propane inventories, they're at high levels and production continues, so I expect that we're going to see in the midterm continued strength in the advantage for North America. And like we said in the prepared statement, the -- some of the delays in the production issues that are happening with the North American capacity that's coming on, should continue to lend support to polyethylene pricing. And we've got price increase announcements out there. And certainly, we're optimistic that we'll be able to secure for that. Yes. Sure. So listen, I'll just continue. Nothing really more to add. We are seeing tightness in some market segments more than others, which is things like high-density polyethylene, you've probably heard the issues around some of the tightness in the markets there. We expect that's going to continue, but not a lot really to add. These things are a little bit hard to predict. And exports, like we had mentioned earlier, did creep up in March, and that's always going to be one of the key factors in terms of new capacity coming on with the feedstock advantage that we have here, a lot of that new capacity is going to go offshore. And we're not faced with any of the supply chain issues like what we were seeing in the early fourth quarter those issues are gone. So the ability to move product offshore is going to help sort of evacuate that volume fairly quickly. Yes, yes. I would say destocking, we don't really see that occurring anymore and people are being cautious in terms of their inventory levels. Thank you for the question, Hassan. I mean like I said before, we've seen this capacity coming for several years. There's not anything really new here. You're exactly right, linear low and high-density capacity has really been differentially higher coming online than low density. But it doesn't change our outlook. We know -- if you go back to the fourth quarter, we really did hit sort of the bottom of the cycle at that point. And now as growth begins to come back in the market, that's going to absorb that capacity. We will sometime in the next several years, get back to a more normalized level of earnings. So not really anything new to add to that. These are things that happen, and we just we have to work through that in the marketplace."

            "content": "Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the first quarter results on Slide 14. First quarter EBITDA increased $52 million to $26 million. Margins for the polypropylene compounding business improved, as product sales prices captured a higher share of rising raw material prices. All of our business areas saw moderately higher demand. We expect demand will moderately improve across most APS businesses during the second quarter. After spending time in this role, I've met with many customers who have told us how much they value our products and innovations. We're working every day to improve our service levels and meet our customers' needs to transform this business. As we mentioned last quarter, we have reshaped APS by moving the Catalloy and polybutane businesses into the O&P Americas and O&P EAI segments, which will allow us to focus on what is core to APS, serving customers with tailored solutions. To further support the growing and shaping of APS core, we announced in March that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Mepol Group. Mepol's expertise in sustainable compounding fits perfectly into our overall strategy to be a leading provider of sustainable solutions. We are confident that our APS platform has significant potential. While our team will have some autonomy to install a more customer-centric business model, we will also be highly accountable for delivering value from our initiatives.

Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies the call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides in our regulatory filings, which are also available in our Investor Relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and earnings per share excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion.

During today's call, we will focus on third quarter results as well as updates on our long-term strategy. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results. And yet again, our people did an excellent job navigating challenging market conditions while remaining laser-focused on the execution of our strategy. Our low-cost footprints in the Americas and the Middle East continued to perform well to capture profitable growth in olefins, polyolefins, propylene oxide and oxyfuels. Let's begin with Slide 3 and discuss our continued leadership in safety performance. LYB's success in operational performance starts with a core focus on safety. Our GoalZERO commitment is to operate safely with zero injuries, zero incidents and zero accidents. Our focus is demonstrated by LYB's September year-to-date total recordable incident rate of 0.13. We are very proud of the continued commitment to safety from our people. Our company is exceeding the safety performance of the top quartile peers in our sector. Please turn to Slide 4 as we briefly review the financials for the quarter. Our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to generate value despite very challenging market conditions. A sharp decline in gasoline crack spreads drove sequentially lower quarterly results for refining and oxyfuels, but we were able to run our newest PO/TBA assets at nameplate capacity. Strong ethylene margins and outsetting cracker utilization allowed our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment to post a 13% sequential EBITDA improvements, the strongest quarter for the segment since the second quarter of 2022. As a result, earnings were $1.88 per share with EBITDA of $1.2 billion. LYB generated $670 million in cash from operating activities, maintaining strong cash conversion on a weaker profit base. Our return on invested capital remains above our cost of capital, and our cash conversion remains robust. We continue to advance our long-term strategy with good progress during the quarter. On Slide 5, we highlight one of these milestones. In September, we started construction of our MoReTec-1 facility in Wesseling, Germany, our first commercial scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell's proprietary catalytic advanced recycling technology. The investment is a clear indication of our commitment to European brand owners and OEMs. German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz and other top officials attended the events to demonstrate solid governmental support. The innovative nature of our proprietary technology has been underlined by the fact that the EU Innovation Fund awarded MoReTec-1 a \u20ac40 million grant. MoReTec-1 is expected to start up in 2026 with capacity to produce 50,000 metric tons per year of cracker feedstocks, recycled from hard-to-recycle mixed plastic waste. The recycled feedstocks will be used in our existing olefins crackers and produce high-value circular polymers that are indistinguishable from fossil-based polymers. Our proprietary MoReTec technology is unique with a plastic to plastic yield of more than 80%, low energy intensity, the ability to utilize 100% renewable electricity, and half of the carbon footprint compared to fossil-based feedstocks. As a leader in the market today, we continue to see healthy margins for our recycled and renewable based polymers given the strong demand and limited supply for these materials. This profitability is core to the second pillar of our corporate strategy: to create a profitable Circular & Low Carbon Solutions, or CLCS business. We continue to expect annual CLCS incremental EBITDA of $1 billion by 2030. As we build our first integrated hub in Germany, we are also planning our second integrated hub for Houston. Please turn to Slide 6 as we discuss the future of our Houston refinery site. We continue on our path to close the refinery by the end of the first quarter of 2025, another strategic milestone for LYB. We're exiting a volatile, low-margin business to focus our resources and opportunities for sustainable value creation. Kim will discuss the financial implications of the refinery closure later in the call. On this slide, we outlined three projects under consideration for the future of the refinery site. The first project, subject to a final investment decision is to utilize a portion of the site for a second larger MoReTec unit. We expect that MoReTec-2 will be twice the size of our German plants with the capacity to produce 100,000 tons of cracker feedstocks. We plan to leverage upon our existing hydrotreaters at the refinery and retrofit them. This will allow us to upgrade both the recycled feedstocks coming from our MoReTec-2 unit and feedstocks from third-party suppliers for use in our olefins crackers for the production of circular and low carbon CirculenRevive polymers. The second project under consideration is to retrofit some of the other refining assets to produce renewable and bio-based feedstocks. These feedstocks would also be used in our existing olefins crackers for the production of circular and low carbon CirculenRenew polymers. And with a substantial array of utilities, laboratories, pipelines, storage, logistical assets and other infrastructure on the 700-acre site, the refinery provides ample opportunity for investments and partnerships to support LYB's continued growth in low-carbon feedstocks and products. Although crude refining at the site will end, we have several opportunities to repurpose the site to capture sustainable value. We are leveraging our existing cost-advantaged assets to satisfy growing market demand for Circular & Low Carbon Solutions. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our financial progress.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7, and let me start by discussing our cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at a 77% rate over the last 12 months, broadly in line with our long-term target of 80%. Difficult market conditions have persisted, pressuring our third quarter cash generation. However, we see potential tailwinds from lower global interest rates and economic stimulus measures in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect cash generation to improve. In the third quarter, we were able to maintain strong shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases totaling almost $1.8 billion over the last 12 months. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $2.6 billion. Despite being at a challenging point in the cycle, our balance sheet remains robust with less than two turns of net debt to EBITDA and available liquidity of $7.3 billion. Let's continue with Slide 8 and review the details of our third quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated $670 million of cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we returned $479 million through dividends and share repurchases, while funding $368 million of capital investment. Our team remains focused and committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation, especially during difficult market conditions. We are expanding profitability with high-return investments in our value enhancement program. We expect to unlock $600 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year and contribute $400 million of EBITDA during 2024. We are on track to shut down refining operations with valuable options for the future of the site. And to grow and upgrade our core, our European asset review is well underway and we are gauging market interest for the five olefins and polyolefins assets that we discussed last quarter. Let's turn to Slide 9, and I'll provide a brief overview of our segment results. LYB's business portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Lower crude prices and gasoline crack spreads led to lower profitability for both the Refining segment and the oxyfuels business within the I&D segment. The decline in these two businesses exceeded the sequential net decline in profitability at the consolidated group level. Improved ethylene margins and our strong cracker operations from our O&P-Americas segment provided upside. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim?\nKim Foley: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 10 with the performance of the Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. During the third quarter, O&P-Americas EBITDA was $758 million, up 13% quarter-on-quarter and 50% year-on-year. Integrated polyethylene margins were supported by low ethane and natural gas costs, coupled with higher polyethylene prices following the successful July price increase. During the quarter, the industry experienced increased cracker downtime, which led to lower ethane cost and tighter ethylene supply supporting olefins margins. LYB's U.S. crackers ran at 95% rates during the quarter, which includes the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in July. Our strong operational performance allowed us to capture the opportunity for favorable margins with our merchant ethylene sales and benefited integrated polyethylene margins. We estimate that the additional profitability from our merchant ethylene sales alone offset approximately $50 million of estimated EBITDA impact from Hurricane Beryl. The segment's third quarter profitability exceeded last year's results by 50% and reached levels not seen since the second quarter of 2022. North American industry demand for polyolefins continues to exceed 2023, with September year-to-date polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes up 7% and 4%, respectively. Industry exports of polyethylene are up 11% September year-to-date, with 46% of North American industry sale volumes sold in export markets. LyondellBasell's U.S. polyethylene business holds a stronger domestic market share than our local peers, with only 26% of LYB September year-to-date polyethylene volumes exported. As such, we did not experience any material disruptions during the brief port strike. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate the typical seasonal trends of softer demand and customers' desire to minimize year-end inventories could constrain price increase initiatives. In addition, sequentially, higher natural gas and ethane prices are likely to pressure integrated margins. Nonetheless, as of this week, our October North American polyethylene orders are the strongest we've seen so far in 2024. Despite volatile oil prices, the favorable oil-to-gas ratio continues to provide an advantage for North American producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. LYB remains well positioned as a leading producer in North America with strong customer relationships built over decades. During the fourth quarter, we will remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demands, targeting 85% utilization across the segment with higher cracker utilization offset by lower polypropylene rates giving the ongoing soft demand for durable goods markets. Please turn to Slide 11, as we review the results of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the third quarter, demand in the markets served by our O&P-EAI segment remains stable with no indications of macroeconomic recovery likely for the remainder of this year. The segment generated EBITDA of $81 million. Volumes declined as we began a planned turnaround at our largest cracker in Europe. Segment EBITDA improved sequentially as lower fixed and feedstock costs led to a higher integrated polyethylene margin. In the European market, we are seeing increased talk of strategic evaluations and capacity rationalizations across our peers. As in the U.S., we expect seasonal softening of demand for olefins and polyolefins. The drive for minimizing year-end inventories will also pressure European markets. In China, we are encouraged by the recent stimulus initiatives, but we have yet to see where the initiatives are resulting in improved market demand. Operationally, planned maintenance at our large Wesseling cracker in Germany will continue into the fourth quarter. As a result of this planned maintenance and softer seasonal demand, we are targeting operating rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter. We continue to make progress on our strategic objectives in O&P-EAI segment. Our European review is underway. In addition to starting the construction of our MoReTec-1 in September, we also acquired full ownership of APK in October, allowing us to integrate APK's unique solvent-based low-density polyethylene recycle technology as part of our comprehensive portfolio for building a profitable CLCS business. Now let's turn to Slide 12 and review the results of the Refining segment. In the third quarter, lackluster demand and high industry operating rates compressed margins and resulted in an EBITDA loss of $23 million. Crack spreads for both gasoline and distillate fuels declined during the quarter. Our distillate hedging program offset some of the margin declines. In the near-term, we expect further margin compression as the Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads continue to fall. We intend to operate at approximately 90% of capacity in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations as we move forward shutting down the refinery during the first quarter of the year. As Peter outlined earlier, our team is making good progress in evaluating strategic projects to transform the refinery site in support of our growth strategy. We have also kept the impacts of our people top of mind throughout this transformation. Since 2022 when we announced our intention to shut down the refinery, we have carefully managed staffing levels. As our staffing requirements decreased following the shutdown, we intend to retrain and redeploy as many affected employees as possible for the next stage of their careers with LYB. Nonetheless, some employees will end up leaving our company, and we will comply with all applicable laws and support our people as best possible. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and outline more details on the operational and financial impacts from that refining exit. Following the holiday season, we plan to begin shutting down the first crude and coker train during January of 2025. Then in February, we expect to begin the shutdown of the second crude and coker train, the FCC, and other ancillary units. This staged approach is designed to ensure a safe, orderly and responsible shutdown of these complex operations. The refinery shutdown impacts both earnings and cash flow. We have been accruing costs related to the shutdown on our income statement, since we announced our intentions in April 2022. However, once the shutdown begins in 2025, we will begin to realize the cash impacts depicted on this slide. During 2025, we expect to release working capital that more than offsets the cash cost of shutting down the refinery. We expect a net cash benefit of approximately $175 million during 2025, assuming a Brent crude price of $80 per barrel. We expect the Refining segment will be reported as discontinued operations from the first quarter of 2025. Within discontinued operations, the ongoing costs related to the former Refining segment are expected to be less than $50 million a year. These are the estimated costs for keeping the site safe, while maintaining operational capability for selected assets and infrastructure. With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron.\nAaron Ledet: Thank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the third quarter, segment EBITDA was $317 million, a decline of $184 million driven by a material decrease in raw material margins for oxyfuels. Oxyfuels margins fell on the declining gasoline crack spreads and slightly higher prices for butane raw materials. Our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business encountered headwinds due to volatile prices for propylene feedstocks and volume impacts from Hurricane Beryl and planned maintenance. While we are encouraged by the potential for lower interest rates to drive recovery in PO&D demand from durable goods, we do not expect markets to materially improve during the remainder of 2024. Our Intermediate Chemicals business was impacted by declining styrene margins due to ample market supply. During the quarter, our newest PO/TBA asset ran very well. And although volatile fuel markets negatively impacted this quarter's oxyfuels results, we believe the fundamentals for this business remain supportive. Our proprietary PO/TBA technology produces oxyfuels from butane at a sizable discount to crude oil used in gasoline production. Global demand for octane and gasoline remains strong, and our oxyfuels provides some of the highest octane levels for all of gasoline blend stocks. We expect our PO/TBA assets will continue to provide a world-leading cost advantage for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. LYB is well positioned to capture opportunities from demand growth and high cost supply rationalization. As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect lower seasonal demand across most of our I&D businesses with oxyfuels margins remaining low, consistent with seasonal norms. In line with our guidance, planned maintenance at one of our Bayport PO/TBA assets will continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our I&D assets at rates of approximately 75% during the fourth quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the third quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $19 million. The APS segment faced weaker demand, particularly in the automotive sector where third quarter global production dropped by 5% from the prior year. The automotive downturn created substantial headwinds for both volumes and pricing. Despite these market headwinds, APS continues to grow through improved win rates in critical markets and improved manufacturing efficiency. As for the third quarter year-to-date, APS EBITDA is up by more than 20% over 2023. Resilient demand from packaging markets allowed us to grow year-to-date volumes and margins in our masterbatch business relative to the first nine months of last year. And we are now realizing the cost benefits from our effort to rationalize 18 APS manufacturing sites around the world over the past six years. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on earning additional high value business by further improvements in our Net Promoter Scores and win rates with customers to restore our growth pipeline. In addition, the APS team continues to optimize working capital to improve cash flow from the business. We're investing in our core team with a growth and value mindset to deliver on our long-term goals for the APS business. With that, I will return the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA of $69 million was lower than the guidance we provided during the second quarter telephone conference. The lower results were due to several customers not achieving the licensing milestones that were expected to occur during the third quarter. But these milestones are on track for the fourth quarter. Catalyst volumes improved on the stronger U.S. demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect modest improvements in licensing revenue will drive slightly higher sequential results. Now let me share our views on our key regional and product markets on Slide 17. In line with our earlier comments, we expect that typical seasonal demand patterns will result in lower fourth quarter profitability across most of our businesses with the potential for improvements deferred until 2025. In the Americas, polyolefin demand is improving relative to 2023. While U.S. natural gas and ethane prices have increased since August, North American costs remain quite favorable on a global scale and should continue to benefit integrated polyethylene margins. Within Europe, market demand remains muted, but stable. We see limited downside from typical reductions in seasonal demand. Indications of near-term market recovery remain elusive, but we are watchful for the potential for demand improvements resulting from lower interest rates. Pressures from prolonged trough conditions and the need to reinvest in aging assets are likely to reshape the European chemical industry. Several peers are following LyondellBasell's leads and announcing programs to transform their European footprint through asset sales, capacity rationalization and other actions. These initiatives are likely to result in a smaller European supply base that is better aligned to serve future local demands. Chinese markets are slowly, but steadily improving from levels far below pre-pandemic conditions. We continue to monitor the impacts of recent stimulus initiatives and remain watchful for catalysts that could benefit demand during 2025. In packaging markets, we continue to see steady demand with some customer discrimination in favor of affordability. In building and construction markets, U.S. stimulus programs are driving increased investments in infrastructure and lower interest rates and pent-up demand are expected to provide tailwinds to both industrial and residential activity. Within automotive markets, production slowed during the third quarter as OEMs took seasonal downtime and higher inventories curtailed production. Demand is expected to remain muted during the fourth quarter as customers wait for lower borrowing costs and steeper discounts. And in oxyfuels and Refining, we expect that third quarter concerns over a weaker demand for fuels in China and strong refinery utilization rates will continue to pressure gasoline crack spreads. Margins are likely to be further constrained by lower seasonal demand. Our focus remains on strong operations and optimization across our global footprint to capture market opportunities. And as Michael emphasized, we are laser-focused on robust long-term cash conversion. Now let me summarize our outlook and our long-term strategy on Slide 18. The third quarter proved to be more challenging than expected, with markedly lower oxyfuels and refining margins only partially offset by improved North American olefins margins. Given the lower third quarter results, we now expect that our profitability for the second half of the year will be lower than our first half results. During the fourth quarter, we expect the impacts from slow global growth will be compounded by softer seasonal demand. Despite these challenges, our North America and Middle East integrated polyolefins production should benefit from low natural gas and ethane prices relative to higher cost oil-based production in other regions. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and working capital management. Our clear investment criteria and resilient core businesses allow us to remain focused on executing our strategy throughout the cycle. The company's balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well positioned to capture opportunities as they arise, we are upgrading our portfolio through our European strategic review and the exit of our Refining business. At the same time, we are growing core capabilities to create sustainable value through investments in Germany and additional plants underway for Texas. And our value enhancement program is on track to unlock at least $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by year-end 2024 and $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Our strategy will not only grow our company but will also reshape our business portfolio to improve profitability and create sustainable competitive advantages. I am proud to lead this dedicated team as we take decisive actions to unlock value, reshape LYB, and position our company for sustainable future success. Now with that, we are pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nVincent Andrews: Thank you and good morning everyone. I wanted to follow-up on some of the comments that were made about the North American polyethylene market. And in particular, I believe it was stated that October has the strongest orders year-to-date, but there were some other comments around the same time about sort of expecting the typical seasonal slowdown and that sort of hindering potential price achievement. So there's a little bit of a tension between those two ideas that customers are loading up now and in October, ahead of maybe price declines later on. So what do you think is causing that strength in orders that you're having the best order book of any month of the year in October?\nPeter Vanacker: Good question, Vincent. Thank you very much. I think we need to look also a little bit to understand October, I mean, to September. And September was a little bit slower compared, I mean, to the two months before. So there's a bit of an overhang in orders from September that we actually see coming in October. But as said, I mean, we do expect, I mean the seasonality as usual towards the end of the year, November and December, that there will be working capital management along the value chain. With that, Kim, anything you want to add?\nKim Foley: I would just make a couple of additional comments, Peter, specifically around North America. I mean as we alluded to in our prepared remarks, right, you saw a feedstock advantage with ethane going into July and August. And then you saw industry down, so you saw a spike in ethylene price that challenged integrated margins. So a lot of customers looked at, as they entered September, they looked at, okay, where is ethylene price and integrated margin is going to go from where they were, and we also see a fall in crude price. So they were optimistic that the crude price would continue to fall and they would see export pricing compete with domestic pricing. And as you've seen over the last couple of weeks, the crude pricing has stabilized more. And you continue to see the demand is there for both exports as well as domestic. So that's why there's that tension and that's why October is so strong.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nPatrick Cunningham: Hi, good morning. I think Aaron alluded to the volatility on PO and derivatives. Now that you're running new asset fully, how much of the decline in the quarter was related to unplanned downtime versus weaker variable margin? And what were overall operating rates in the quarter? And then in terms of 4Q, do you still expect similar levels of maintenance here, or is that an additional drag sequentially?\nAaron Ledet: Yes. Thank you for the question, Patrick. I'd say, listen, despite the challenging market environment, the positive takeaway is that sales are up 4% globally year-over-year through the third quarter, with all of the growth really coming from Europe and the U.S. Higher propylene prices in the U.S. are actually limiting exports to Asia. So you see that impacting our operating rates. And as we look to the fourth quarter, that's where the quote of 75% comes from. That is impacted, as mentioned in my planned remarks, by the Bayport turnaround, which we've just recently started up here at the end of October. As we look forward, we're still optimistic that the interest rate reductions and the stimulus packages will have some favorable impact on durable demand, but it's not likely to occur in 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you. Good morning. Peter, just on polyethylene pricing, do you expect polyethylene prices to decline in the fourth quarter?\nPeter Vanacker: Hi, David, it's a good question, of course, yes. And I'm going to pull up my crystal ball. You know that we have two additional price increases in the market, $0.03 per pound for October, $0.03 per pound for November. A bit premature to say because, at the beginning of November, as you know, discussions are ongoing to see if price increases will be successful or not. If I look at the underlying demand, and Kim alluded to that, domestic U.S. demand being up by 6% year-to-date, being up by 4% compared to last year; capacity utilization were above 85%; exports up by 11%; good demand in October that we just explained, or Kim explained. So we remain hopeful that we will see part of the price increases go through. But as said, it remains to be seen because these discussions are currently ongoing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nJeffrey Zekauskas: Thanks very much. I think on your Analyst Day in 2023, you thought that -- or Lyondell thought that the normalized EBITDA of the U.S. Olefins and Polyolefins business and the European Olefins and Polyolefins business was $7 billion. And since that time, there have been capacity additions and Asia, China has slowed down. Europe's energy prices have come up. I think you want to exit part of your European business? What do you think is the normalized EBITDA of the U.S. and European business now? Is it still $7 billion or is it a different number?\nMichael McMurray: Jeff, what I'd say is the number for our North American business is largely unchanged. When we did our Analyst Day, we probably didn't have full visibility as to what is going on in Europe. And so I think as we sit here today, if you think about what's going on in Europe with higher cost energy and the regulatory environment, that, yes, probably Europe, the earnings power is a little bit lower than it had been in the past.\nKim Foley: I think there's a lot of moving parts in the macroeconomics, that you also have to contemplate what will happen with China stimulus, and will it be able to consume the new capacity to bring online. What will happen as the EU starts to rationalize? You've seen some of the announcements out there. And then in North America, you have to remember, it's the lowest cost from a feedstock perspective, for sure, region of the world, and we have no new ethylene capacity coming online for a few years. So you have to take all that into consideration as well.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes and the other part that I want to add to that is, of course, our big transformation that we are going through, the elements that we have with the exit of the Refining on one hand side, but especially also the European assessments that is currently ongoing, and then our investments in the Middle East. So our portfolio of the past is not going to be the same as our portfolio in the future. We're repositioning in Europe, as you know, leveraging also upon the demand from the OEMs, the brand owners in circular and renewable solutions. We're doing the necessary investments in our Cologne hub. We see that regulation is moving in Europe in the right direction. We're building up low-cost delivered positions in the Middle East. So that means that our future portfolio of cost advantage operations will move from about 60% to 70%.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nAleksey Yefremov: Thanks and good morning. I wanted to ask about the ATK acquisition -- sorry, APK. What's the degree of maturity of this technology? And is it ready for additional investments for capacity expansions perhaps in the near future?\nPeter Vanacker: Aleksey, thank you for your question. Well, noticed, I mean, that we have now full ownership over the company, APK. We're very pleased, I mean, with that acquisition because we had expanded our entire portfolio of renewable and circular solutions leveraging upon different technologies from waste-based renewable hydrocarbons to mechanical recycling to our MoReTec technology, which is an advanced chemical catalytic recycling technology. And now we also have with APK a solution-based recycling technology, which allows especially laminated films to be recycled. So we're in the process of integrating that company. We've acquired them because we see a huge benefit that they have because they are, in our view, the most advanced technology company in terms of solution-based recycling. So of course, as we are integrating them, we have a plan behind it in -- which one may compare a bit, I mean, to our MoReTec investment. So looking at applying the technology, looking at scaling up the technology. So if you fast forward it, I mean, to 2030, it will be an integral part of our total offering that we have to brand owners and OEMs.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nJoshua Spector: Yes, hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a more longer-term question about the U.S. asset mix over time. So if you look at your cracker feed that you disclosed in this last quarter, you're about 95% light between NGLs and ethane. I guess as you look at converting the refinery site, and you talked about bio-based feedstocks, other recycle based feedstocks and what you're building yourself, what do you view is that cracker mix being, call it, five, six years from now? And assuming that's higher in terms of heavier feed tomorrow versus today, that's going to derate your crackers a little bit on the ethane or ethylene side, would you invest to maintain that or would you accept that shift as part of that change? Thanks.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes, hi, Josh, very good question. Of course, the first thing that I want to outline, and then I hand over to Kim is with the transformation that we're doing on the Refining side, we are coming from the markets. So we're coming from the demand that is coming from brand owners, OEMs through the value chain to us, demand for renewable and circular solutions. And as we are looking at that demand and how it is growing, mid- to long-term, that's how we are basing, of course, our asset strategy and the investments of, for example, a MoReTec-2 facility with upgrading capacities through the hydrotreaters as we alluded to in the prepared remarks. So it comes from demand how we are ramping up, I mean, those capacities. And of course, those capacities, those liquid fractions with, of course, also due to our MoReTec technology, there's also a gas fraction will be fed into our crackers, especially, I would say, the one that we have in Channelview. So it's not that we're coming from Channelview and we're changing the mix in the cracker, but we're coming from the market and building up our MoReTec technology to then see how can we actually feed it into our crackers and capture that margin that we have alluded to in the Capital Markets Day, the incremental margin over time. Kim, do you want to add something?\nKim Foley: Yes, just a couple of comments. So thanks for asking, Josh, because it gives us the opportunity to again reemphasize this is a small investment to get into these product lines, these advanced circular product lines, by just putting a front end to our existing liquid flexible crackers, right? So when we think about how we operate in North America, I also want to reiterate, it's always about optimization, what we look at or refer to as our cost of ethylene. So yes, could we run 100% ethane at Channelview? Yes, we could, but we won't, because we -- it's more profitable for us to run some NGLs, just like it will be more profitable for us to look at the feed slate as we better understand the different feedstocks that will come in from circularity. So I think it's a great question. I really appreciate it. And I would just highlight, we had tremendous feedstock flexibility and the opportunity to get into a new market in a low cost way.\nPeter Vanacker: One of the beauties, I mean, that I think is in our strategy, Josh, is also the fact that, like Kim alluded to, it's a relatively small investment when you compare it to having to invest in a complete new cracker with everything around it. So it's leveraging upon our existing infrastructure. I mean CO2 emissions are also included, of course, in the steel and iron that you're building. So leveraging upon the existing infrastructure that we have, and mainly focusing on what do we need to add, yes, so waste sorting is something that we need to add. Advanced chemical recycling is something that we need to add to with our proprietary technology, the MoReTec technology. We don't need to add hydrotreaters in Houston, because we have them. We just need to modify them. So the investment compared to a fully blown up new cracker is substantially lower, and it allows you to be in a market that allows us to be in a market with low carbon footprint molecules up to net zero. And at the same time, also circular products.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research.\nFrank Mitsch: Thank you and good morning. Peter, I was wondering if you could provide an update on the timelines in terms of the European restructuring. And to that end, did I understand you correctly that following this process, your expectation is that your European operating rates would increase by 10%. If you could talk a little bit about what's going on. What's your outlook for your European operating rates and again on the restructuring actions you're taking there? Thank you.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes, thank you, Frank. Good question. First that I would like to highlight is some of us here around the table are now around 35 years in the chemical industry. I've seen multiple cycles in the chemical industry. This is actually the first time in my career that I have seen that people are not just talking about restructuring and taking capacities out in a certain region, but it's actually happening, and it's happening faster that I believe that anybody, including advisers, consultants have anticipated. We are now somewhere between 2 million and 2.5 million tons depending on what timeline you take of ethylene capacity that has been announced that is being taken out in Europe. And some consultants have alluded to the fact that there should be somewhere around 2.5 million, 3 million tons, I mean to have again a balanced market. So it is in that environment that we have very early at an early stage started with the European assessment and make the corresponding announcements. So at this point in time, we are in the markets. We are looking at several opportunities. And we've alluded to that as well before, that can be selling the entire package of five sites in O&P. It can also be restructuring those sites. It can also be selling one or two or three sites, or selling them separately. So we are in the market. And we're expecting that we will get in 2025 quite a lot of clarity. So of course, as usual, we'll keep you informed about the progress, but it will take a little bit of time. These things, they don't go, as you know, I mean, from today to tomorrow. What I was alluding to before, the 60% to 70% is not because of capacity utilization or what. I mean I was saying that if you look at the total portfolio that LyondellBasell has in terms of cost-advantaged operations, so cost-advantaged assets, today this is around 60%, that is cost advantaged assets. After exiting the refinery and modifying it for our recycled renewable products, and after having exited the six operations that we talked about in Europe, that then our portfolio would consist out of 70% cost-advantaged operations. So the remaining 30% of costs -- the remaining 30% is pretty much assets that are serving our renewable and recycled strategy.\nMichael McMurray: Frank, congrats on the Jets beating the Texans.\nFrank Mitsch: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mike Sison with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Sison: Hey, good morning guys. So thinking about polyethylene this year, integrated margins have done really well in the $0.30 per ton range, costs are low. And as you've noted, it sounds like demand is pretty good. So what needs to get better, I guess, in 2025 for O&P-Americas to grow EBITDA given how well, it seems like the polyethylene has generally done well this year?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, Mike, first of all, demand needs to continue to go up in PE. Today, demand by PE -- demand growth, I mean, PE is not so much related, I mean, to durable goods as inflation rates have gone down, as interest rates were expected to continue to go down, then we would hope that that will have an impact on consumer confidence, buying of apartments, houses, for the construction business would go up. And that would have a benefit, of course, both to the PE business as well as the PP business. Plus in addition to that, of course, also Aaron's propylene oxide business. So the other thing I want to allude to as well is if you look at year-to-date this year, the delta in EBITDA versus year-to-date last year, well, about 70% of that delta is coming from the Refining business. So next year, we are exiting the Refining business, that will be discontinued operations, so that will not be in the mix anymore, which gives you an indication as well that the rest of the businesses compared to last year, despite the fact that we haven't seen durable goods picking up. Europe still being in a crisis, China not having picked up, has been relatively stable. And the other 30% is pretty much, I mean, related then, of course, also to the impact that lower gasoline cracks have on the oxyfuels business.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Yes, good morning. Thanks very much. Maybe a two part question on your refining transition. First, I appreciate the detail on Slide 13. Nice to see the net cash flow contribution. One question would be, as you throttle down on refining, should we anticipate any earnings impact on your other segments? Just thinking about products, co-products, utilities that may move across the fence, so to speak. And then secondly, as you...\nPeter Vanacker: Nothing that's material.\nKevin McCarthy: Nothing material? Okay, good. Okay. And then if I may, are you still looking at a final investment decision on MoReTec-2 by March or so, Peter?\nPeter Vanacker: No, it doesn't go that fast, Kevin. And we hope it goes that fast, but it doesn't go that fast. So what we would look at, I mean in first quartile next year is that we make one important step, the first step, let's say in the investment cycle. This is not a final investment decision yet. But it's the first step, which would lead, of course, then also to starting to order long lead items, preparing the ground, do some infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera. FID, I would -- for the final step, I would expect that to happen in 2026. One thing already that I want to outline a bit here is that our investment strategy has changed, and we are in -- our concept is a modular concept that we have, which is something we are applying in the first MRT investment in Cologne. And we would do the same in the second investment in Houston. So that means, if we make that step on deciding on the first step for Houston, it already is an important commitment. It's intrinsic I mean to the nature of doing modular investments. So it is a higher commitment already in terms of total CapEx.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nHassan Ahmed: Good morning, Peter. I just wanted to go back to the European review. Several questions, obviously asked about that. I mean since you guys obviously announced the review, and clearly, you guys were amongst the first to do so, more and more companies are coming out and doing that. And I'm still sort of trying to sort of understand how you guys will create value doing that, how you balance out sort of asset sales. Presumably now there will be more and more of a glut of assets being set up to be sold out there. So I would imagine pricing would go down, because of that. And obviously, Europe being Europe, shutdowns can be quite pricey over there. So I mean, how do you think about the calculus behind that?\nPeter Vanacker: Hassan, if I look at the announcement that so far have been made in the industry for Europe, then the 2 million tons or 2.5 million tons, depending on the timeline you take that I have mentioned before, are shutdowns. So they have been announced as these assets will be shut down. The assets that we are talking about in our portfolio are not bad assets. I mean, they are good assets. They are like take Bayer, for example, is a flexible cracker. Yes, it has integrated, I mean, polymerization next to it. So it has a good location from a logistic point of view. It has the preferential electricity costs, because of the nuclear industry that you have in France that is being supported, and we'll -- we expect will continue to be supported as well, if you look at current discussions on a European level. So we do believe that there may be good owners, I mean, for those assets, not necessarily that we are the right owner, I mean, for those assets. And you'll see the transformation that I mentioned before. We are investing and have very good experience in Saudi Arabia. So we continue to progress on that investment strategy in the Middle East.\nMichael McMurray: And what I'd say is that, so the process is underway. I hope you all appreciate. We can't share an incredible amount of details. But there will be more to share in the new year. But probably not early.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn it back to Mr. Vanacker for closing comments.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes. Thank you all. Of course, as usual, very thoughtful questions. Let me highlight the following. I mean we continue to make excellent progress on our strategy to make LYB a much more focused company with a leading advantaged asset portfolio and product mix. You heard me saying that a couple of times in this call. Now 2025 will, for us, be a very important transformational year. We highlight a couple of the things that we are executing in 2025. I mean, first, we exit our Refining business and we start preparing for the transition into a renewable and circular hub. Second, we execute on the European asset assessment. Third, we progressed on our first MoReTec investment in Germany and we prepare for the second one in Houston. Fourth, we prepare for carbon value creation projects in our existing large assets, not building new assets, but the existing large assets. And fifth, we continue to further develop our Middle East footprint. So all these actions, as I mentioned during the call are expected to grow our asset portfolio of cost-advantaged operations from the current 60% to 70%. And as we mentioned in the last earnings call, we step up our mid-cycle EBITDA margin by doing so. Let me highlight as well that we provided industry leading 6% total capital return yields in Q3 as well. So of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on all the aspects of our long-term strategy. We hope that you all will have a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Aaron Ledet",
            "content": "Thank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates and Derivatives segment. In the third quarter, segment EBITDA was $317 million, a decline of $184 million driven by a material decrease in raw material margins for oxyfuels. Oxyfuels margins fell on the declining gasoline crack spreads and slightly higher prices for butane raw materials. Our Propylene Oxide & Derivatives business encountered headwinds due to volatile prices for propylene feedstocks and volume impacts from Hurricane Beryl and planned maintenance. While we are encouraged by the potential for lower interest rates to drive recovery in PO&D demand from durable goods, we do not expect markets to materially improve during the remainder of 2024. Our Intermediate Chemicals business was impacted by declining styrene margins due to ample market supply. During the quarter, our newest PO/TBA asset ran very well. And although volatile fuel markets negatively impacted this quarter's oxyfuels results, we believe the fundamentals for this business remain supportive. Our proprietary PO/TBA technology produces oxyfuels from butane at a sizable discount to crude oil used in gasoline production. Global demand for octane and gasoline remains strong, and our oxyfuels provides some of the highest octane levels for all of gasoline blend stocks. We expect our PO/TBA assets will continue to provide a world-leading cost advantage for propylene oxide and oxyfuels. LYB is well positioned to capture opportunities from demand growth and high cost supply rationalization. As we move through the fourth quarter, we expect lower seasonal demand across most of our I&D businesses with oxyfuels margins remaining low, consistent with seasonal norms. In line with our guidance, planned maintenance at one of our Bayport PO/TBA assets will continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our I&D assets at rates of approximately 75% during the fourth quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Yes. Thank you for the question, Patrick. I'd say, listen, despite the challenging market environment, the positive takeaway is that sales are up 4% globally year-over-year through the third quarter, with all of the growth really coming from Europe and the U.S. Higher propylene prices in the U.S. are actually limiting exports to Asia. So you see that impacting our operating rates. And as we look to the fourth quarter, that's where the quote of 75% comes from. That is impacted, as mentioned in my planned remarks, by the Bayport turnaround, which we've just recently started up here at the end of October. As we look forward, we're still optimistic that the interest rate reductions and the stimulus packages will have some favorable impact on durable demand, but it's not likely to occur in 2024."

            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our third quarter results. And yet again, our people did an excellent job navigating challenging market conditions while remaining laser-focused on the execution of our strategy. Our low-cost footprints in the Americas and the Middle East continued to perform well to capture profitable growth in olefins, polyolefins, propylene oxide and oxyfuels. Let's begin with Slide 3 and discuss our continued leadership in safety performance. LYB's success in operational performance starts with a core focus on safety. Our GoalZERO commitment is to operate safely with zero injuries, zero incidents and zero accidents. Our focus is demonstrated by LYB's September year-to-date total recordable incident rate of 0.13. We are very proud of the continued commitment to safety from our people. Our company is exceeding the safety performance of the top quartile peers in our sector. Please turn to Slide 4 as we briefly review the financials for the quarter. Our third quarter results demonstrate our ability to generate value despite very challenging market conditions. A sharp decline in gasoline crack spreads drove sequentially lower quarterly results for refining and oxyfuels, but we were able to run our newest PO/TBA assets at nameplate capacity. Strong ethylene margins and outsetting cracker utilization allowed our Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment to post a 13% sequential EBITDA improvements, the strongest quarter for the segment since the second quarter of 2022. As a result, earnings were $1.88 per share with EBITDA of $1.2 billion. LYB generated $670 million in cash from operating activities, maintaining strong cash conversion on a weaker profit base. Our return on invested capital remains above our cost of capital, and our cash conversion remains robust. We continue to advance our long-term strategy with good progress during the quarter. On Slide 5, we highlight one of these milestones. In September, we started construction of our MoReTec-1 facility in Wesseling, Germany, our first commercial scale plant utilizing LyondellBasell's proprietary catalytic advanced recycling technology. The investment is a clear indication of our commitment to European brand owners and OEMs. German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz and other top officials attended the events to demonstrate solid governmental support. The innovative nature of our proprietary technology has been underlined by the fact that the EU Innovation Fund awarded MoReTec-1 a \u20ac40 million grant. MoReTec-1 is expected to start up in 2026 with capacity to produce 50,000 metric tons per year of cracker feedstocks, recycled from hard-to-recycle mixed plastic waste. The recycled feedstocks will be used in our existing olefins crackers and produce high-value circular polymers that are indistinguishable from fossil-based polymers. Our proprietary MoReTec technology is unique with a plastic to plastic yield of more than 80%, low energy intensity, the ability to utilize 100% renewable electricity, and half of the carbon footprint compared to fossil-based feedstocks. As a leader in the market today, we continue to see healthy margins for our recycled and renewable based polymers given the strong demand and limited supply for these materials. This profitability is core to the second pillar of our corporate strategy: to create a profitable Circular & Low Carbon Solutions, or CLCS business. We continue to expect annual CLCS incremental EBITDA of $1 billion by 2030. As we build our first integrated hub in Germany, we are also planning our second integrated hub for Houston. Please turn to Slide 6 as we discuss the future of our Houston refinery site. We continue on our path to close the refinery by the end of the first quarter of 2025, another strategic milestone for LYB. We're exiting a volatile, low-margin business to focus our resources and opportunities for sustainable value creation. Kim will discuss the financial implications of the refinery closure later in the call. On this slide, we outlined three projects under consideration for the future of the refinery site. The first project, subject to a final investment decision is to utilize a portion of the site for a second larger MoReTec unit. We expect that MoReTec-2 will be twice the size of our German plants with the capacity to produce 100,000 tons of cracker feedstocks. We plan to leverage upon our existing hydrotreaters at the refinery and retrofit them. This will allow us to upgrade both the recycled feedstocks coming from our MoReTec-2 unit and feedstocks from third-party suppliers for use in our olefins crackers for the production of circular and low carbon CirculenRevive polymers. The second project under consideration is to retrofit some of the other refining assets to produce renewable and bio-based feedstocks. These feedstocks would also be used in our existing olefins crackers for the production of circular and low carbon CirculenRenew polymers. And with a substantial array of utilities, laboratories, pipelines, storage, logistical assets and other infrastructure on the 700-acre site, the refinery provides ample opportunity for investments and partnerships to support LYB's continued growth in low-carbon feedstocks and products. Although crude refining at the site will end, we have several opportunities to repurpose the site to capture sustainable value. We are leveraging our existing cost-advantaged assets to satisfy growing market demand for Circular & Low Carbon Solutions. I will now turn the call over to Michael to discuss our financial progress. Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Third quarter EBITDA of $69 million was lower than the guidance we provided during the second quarter telephone conference. The lower results were due to several customers not achieving the licensing milestones that were expected to occur during the third quarter. But these milestones are on track for the fourth quarter. Catalyst volumes improved on the stronger U.S. demand. In the fourth quarter, we expect modest improvements in licensing revenue will drive slightly higher sequential results. Now let me share our views on our key regional and product markets on Slide 17. In line with our earlier comments, we expect that typical seasonal demand patterns will result in lower fourth quarter profitability across most of our businesses with the potential for improvements deferred until 2025. In the Americas, polyolefin demand is improving relative to 2023. While U.S. natural gas and ethane prices have increased since August, North American costs remain quite favorable on a global scale and should continue to benefit integrated polyethylene margins. Within Europe, market demand remains muted, but stable. We see limited downside from typical reductions in seasonal demand. Indications of near-term market recovery remain elusive, but we are watchful for the potential for demand improvements resulting from lower interest rates. Pressures from prolonged trough conditions and the need to reinvest in aging assets are likely to reshape the European chemical industry. Several peers are following LyondellBasell's leads and announcing programs to transform their European footprint through asset sales, capacity rationalization and other actions. These initiatives are likely to result in a smaller European supply base that is better aligned to serve future local demands. Chinese markets are slowly, but steadily improving from levels far below pre-pandemic conditions. We continue to monitor the impacts of recent stimulus initiatives and remain watchful for catalysts that could benefit demand during 2025. In packaging markets, we continue to see steady demand with some customer discrimination in favor of affordability. In building and construction markets, U.S. stimulus programs are driving increased investments in infrastructure and lower interest rates and pent-up demand are expected to provide tailwinds to both industrial and residential activity. Within automotive markets, production slowed during the third quarter as OEMs took seasonal downtime and higher inventories curtailed production. Demand is expected to remain muted during the fourth quarter as customers wait for lower borrowing costs and steeper discounts. And in oxyfuels and Refining, we expect that third quarter concerns over a weaker demand for fuels in China and strong refinery utilization rates will continue to pressure gasoline crack spreads. Margins are likely to be further constrained by lower seasonal demand. Our focus remains on strong operations and optimization across our global footprint to capture market opportunities. And as Michael emphasized, we are laser-focused on robust long-term cash conversion. Now let me summarize our outlook and our long-term strategy on Slide 18. The third quarter proved to be more challenging than expected, with markedly lower oxyfuels and refining margins only partially offset by improved North American olefins margins. Given the lower third quarter results, we now expect that our profitability for the second half of the year will be lower than our first half results. During the fourth quarter, we expect the impacts from slow global growth will be compounded by softer seasonal demand. Despite these challenges, our North America and Middle East integrated polyolefins production should benefit from low natural gas and ethane prices relative to higher cost oil-based production in other regions. Against this backdrop, we remain focused on disciplined capital allocation and working capital management. Our clear investment criteria and resilient core businesses allow us to remain focused on executing our strategy throughout the cycle. The company's balance sheet is in great shape, and we are well positioned to capture opportunities as they arise, we are upgrading our portfolio through our European strategic review and the exit of our Refining business. At the same time, we are growing core capabilities to create sustainable value through investments in Germany and additional plants underway for Texas. And our value enhancement program is on track to unlock at least $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by year-end 2024 and $1 billion of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Our strategy will not only grow our company but will also reshape our business portfolio to improve profitability and create sustainable competitive advantages. I am proud to lead this dedicated team as we take decisive actions to unlock value, reshape LYB, and position our company for sustainable future success. Now with that, we are pleased to take your questions. Good question, Vincent. Thank you very much. I think we need to look also a little bit to understand October, I mean, to September. And September was a little bit slower compared, I mean, to the two months before. So there's a bit of an overhang in orders from September that we actually see coming in October. But as said, I mean, we do expect, I mean the seasonality as usual towards the end of the year, November and December, that there will be working capital management along the value chain. With that, Kim, anything you want to add? Hi, David, it's a good question, of course, yes. And I'm going to pull up my crystal ball. You know that we have two additional price increases in the market, $0.03 per pound for October, $0.03 per pound for November. A bit premature to say because, at the beginning of November, as you know, discussions are ongoing to see if price increases will be successful or not. If I look at the underlying demand, and Kim alluded to that, domestic U.S. demand being up by 6% year-to-date, being up by 4% compared to last year; capacity utilization were above 85%; exports up by 11%; good demand in October that we just explained, or Kim explained. So we remain hopeful that we will see part of the price increases go through. But as said, it remains to be seen because these discussions are currently ongoing. Yes and the other part that I want to add to that is, of course, our big transformation that we are going through, the elements that we have with the exit of the Refining on one hand side, but especially also the European assessments that is currently ongoing, and then our investments in the Middle East. So our portfolio of the past is not going to be the same as our portfolio in the future. We're repositioning in Europe, as you know, leveraging also upon the demand from the OEMs, the brand owners in circular and renewable solutions. We're doing the necessary investments in our Cologne hub. We see that regulation is moving in Europe in the right direction. We're building up low-cost delivered positions in the Middle East. So that means that our future portfolio of cost advantage operations will move from about 60% to 70%. Aleksey, thank you for your question. Well, noticed, I mean, that we have now full ownership over the company, APK. We're very pleased, I mean, with that acquisition because we had expanded our entire portfolio of renewable and circular solutions leveraging upon different technologies from waste-based renewable hydrocarbons to mechanical recycling to our MoReTec technology, which is an advanced chemical catalytic recycling technology. And now we also have with APK a solution-based recycling technology, which allows especially laminated films to be recycled. So we're in the process of integrating that company. We've acquired them because we see a huge benefit that they have because they are, in our view, the most advanced technology company in terms of solution-based recycling. So of course, as we are integrating them, we have a plan behind it in -- which one may compare a bit, I mean, to our MoReTec investment. So looking at applying the technology, looking at scaling up the technology. So if you fast forward it, I mean, to 2030, it will be an integral part of our total offering that we have to brand owners and OEMs. Yes, hi, Josh, very good question. Of course, the first thing that I want to outline, and then I hand over to Kim is with the transformation that we're doing on the Refining side, we are coming from the markets. So we're coming from the demand that is coming from brand owners, OEMs through the value chain to us, demand for renewable and circular solutions. And as we are looking at that demand and how it is growing, mid- to long-term, that's how we are basing, of course, our asset strategy and the investments of, for example, a MoReTec-2 facility with upgrading capacities through the hydrotreaters as we alluded to in the prepared remarks. So it comes from demand how we are ramping up, I mean, those capacities. And of course, those capacities, those liquid fractions with, of course, also due to our MoReTec technology, there's also a gas fraction will be fed into our crackers, especially, I would say, the one that we have in Channelview. So it's not that we're coming from Channelview and we're changing the mix in the cracker, but we're coming from the market and building up our MoReTec technology to then see how can we actually feed it into our crackers and capture that margin that we have alluded to in the Capital Markets Day, the incremental margin over time. Kim, do you want to add something? One of the beauties, I mean, that I think is in our strategy, Josh, is also the fact that, like Kim alluded to, it's a relatively small investment when you compare it to having to invest in a complete new cracker with everything around it. So it's leveraging upon our existing infrastructure. I mean CO2 emissions are also included, of course, in the steel and iron that you're building. So leveraging upon the existing infrastructure that we have, and mainly focusing on what do we need to add, yes, so waste sorting is something that we need to add. Advanced chemical recycling is something that we need to add to with our proprietary technology, the MoReTec technology. We don't need to add hydrotreaters in Houston, because we have them. We just need to modify them. So the investment compared to a fully blown up new cracker is substantially lower, and it allows you to be in a market that allows us to be in a market with low carbon footprint molecules up to net zero. And at the same time, also circular products. Yes, thank you, Frank. Good question. First that I would like to highlight is some of us here around the table are now around 35 years in the chemical industry. I've seen multiple cycles in the chemical industry. This is actually the first time in my career that I have seen that people are not just talking about restructuring and taking capacities out in a certain region, but it's actually happening, and it's happening faster that I believe that anybody, including advisers, consultants have anticipated. We are now somewhere between 2 million and 2.5 million tons depending on what timeline you take of ethylene capacity that has been announced that is being taken out in Europe. And some consultants have alluded to the fact that there should be somewhere around 2.5 million, 3 million tons, I mean to have again a balanced market. So it is in that environment that we have very early at an early stage started with the European assessment and make the corresponding announcements. So at this point in time, we are in the markets. We are looking at several opportunities. And we've alluded to that as well before, that can be selling the entire package of five sites in O&P. It can also be restructuring those sites. It can also be selling one or two or three sites, or selling them separately. So we are in the market. And we're expecting that we will get in 2025 quite a lot of clarity. So of course, as usual, we'll keep you informed about the progress, but it will take a little bit of time. These things, they don't go, as you know, I mean, from today to tomorrow. What I was alluding to before, the 60% to 70% is not because of capacity utilization or what. I mean I was saying that if you look at the total portfolio that LyondellBasell has in terms of cost-advantaged operations, so cost-advantaged assets, today this is around 60%, that is cost advantaged assets. After exiting the refinery and modifying it for our recycled renewable products, and after having exited the six operations that we talked about in Europe, that then our portfolio would consist out of 70% cost-advantaged operations. So the remaining 30% of costs -- the remaining 30% is pretty much assets that are serving our renewable and recycled strategy. Well, Mike, first of all, demand needs to continue to go up in PE. Today, demand by PE -- demand growth, I mean, PE is not so much related, I mean, to durable goods as inflation rates have gone down, as interest rates were expected to continue to go down, then we would hope that that will have an impact on consumer confidence, buying of apartments, houses, for the construction business would go up. And that would have a benefit, of course, both to the PE business as well as the PP business. Plus in addition to that, of course, also Aaron's propylene oxide business. So the other thing I want to allude to as well is if you look at year-to-date this year, the delta in EBITDA versus year-to-date last year, well, about 70% of that delta is coming from the Refining business. So next year, we are exiting the Refining business, that will be discontinued operations, so that will not be in the mix anymore, which gives you an indication as well that the rest of the businesses compared to last year, despite the fact that we haven't seen durable goods picking up. Europe still being in a crisis, China not having picked up, has been relatively stable. And the other 30% is pretty much, I mean, related then, of course, also to the impact that lower gasoline cracks have on the oxyfuels business. Nothing that's material. No, it doesn't go that fast, Kevin. And we hope it goes that fast, but it doesn't go that fast. So what we would look at, I mean in first quartile next year is that we make one important step, the first step, let's say in the investment cycle. This is not a final investment decision yet. But it's the first step, which would lead, of course, then also to starting to order long lead items, preparing the ground, do some infrastructure, et cetera, et cetera. FID, I would -- for the final step, I would expect that to happen in 2026. One thing already that I want to outline a bit here is that our investment strategy has changed, and we are in -- our concept is a modular concept that we have, which is something we are applying in the first MRT investment in Cologne. And we would do the same in the second investment in Houston. So that means, if we make that step on deciding on the first step for Houston, it already is an important commitment. It's intrinsic I mean to the nature of doing modular investments. So it is a higher commitment already in terms of total CapEx. Hassan, if I look at the announcement that so far have been made in the industry for Europe, then the 2 million tons or 2.5 million tons, depending on the timeline you take that I have mentioned before, are shutdowns. So they have been announced as these assets will be shut down. The assets that we are talking about in our portfolio are not bad assets. I mean, they are good assets. They are like take Bayer, for example, is a flexible cracker. Yes, it has integrated, I mean, polymerization next to it. So it has a good location from a logistic point of view. It has the preferential electricity costs, because of the nuclear industry that you have in France that is being supported, and we'll -- we expect will continue to be supported as well, if you look at current discussions on a European level. So we do believe that there may be good owners, I mean, for those assets, not necessarily that we are the right owner, I mean, for those assets. And you'll see the transformation that I mentioned before. We are investing and have very good experience in Saudi Arabia. So we continue to progress on that investment strategy in the Middle East. Yes. Thank you all. Of course, as usual, very thoughtful questions. Let me highlight the following. I mean we continue to make excellent progress on our strategy to make LYB a much more focused company with a leading advantaged asset portfolio and product mix. You heard me saying that a couple of times in this call. Now 2025 will, for us, be a very important transformational year. We highlight a couple of the things that we are executing in 2025.

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7, and let me start by discussing our cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $3.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at a 77% rate over the last 12 months, broadly in line with our long-term target of 80%. Difficult market conditions have persisted, pressuring our third quarter cash generation. However, we see potential tailwinds from lower global interest rates and economic stimulus measures in China. In the fourth quarter, we expect cash generation to improve. In the third quarter, we were able to maintain strong shareholder returns with dividends and share repurchases totaling almost $1.8 billion over the last 12 months. At the end of the third quarter, our cash balance was $2.6 billion. Despite being at a challenging point in the cycle, our balance sheet remains robust with less than two turns of net debt to EBITDA and available liquidity of $7.3 billion. Let's continue with Slide 8 and review the details of our third quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated $670 million of cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we returned $479 million through dividends and share repurchases, while funding $368 million of capital investment. Our team remains focused and committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation, especially during difficult market conditions. We are expanding profitability with high-return investments in our value enhancement program. We expect to unlock $600 million in recurring annual EBITDA by the end of this year and contribute $400 million of EBITDA during 2024. We are on track to shut down refining operations with valuable options for the future of the site. And to grow and upgrade our core, our European asset review is well underway and we are gauging market interest for the five olefins and polyolefins assets that we discussed last quarter. Let's turn to Slide 9, and I'll provide a brief overview of our segment results. LYB's business portfolio delivered $1.2 billion of EBITDA during the third quarter. Lower crude prices and gasoline crack spreads led to lower profitability for both the Refining segment and the oxyfuels business within the I&D segment. The decline in these two businesses exceeded the sequential net decline in profitability at the consolidated group level. Improved ethylene margins and our strong cracker operations from our O&P-Americas segment provided upside. With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim? Jeff, what I'd say is the number for our North American business is largely unchanged. When we did our Analyst Day, we probably didn't have full visibility as to what is going on in Europe. And so I think as we sit here today, if you think about what's going on in Europe with higher cost energy and the regulatory environment, that, yes, probably Europe, the earnings power is a little bit lower than it had been in the past. Frank, congrats on the Jets beating the Texans. And what I'd say is that, so the process is underway. I hope you all appreciate. We can't share an incredible amount of details. But there will be more to share in the new year. But probably not early."

            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 10 with the performance of the Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas segment. During the third quarter, O&P-Americas EBITDA was $758 million, up 13% quarter-on-quarter and 50% year-on-year. Integrated polyethylene margins were supported by low ethane and natural gas costs, coupled with higher polyethylene prices following the successful July price increase. During the quarter, the industry experienced increased cracker downtime, which led to lower ethane cost and tighter ethylene supply supporting olefins margins. LYB's U.S. crackers ran at 95% rates during the quarter, which includes the impacts of Hurricane Beryl in July. Our strong operational performance allowed us to capture the opportunity for favorable margins with our merchant ethylene sales and benefited integrated polyethylene margins. We estimate that the additional profitability from our merchant ethylene sales alone offset approximately $50 million of estimated EBITDA impact from Hurricane Beryl. The segment's third quarter profitability exceeded last year's results by 50% and reached levels not seen since the second quarter of 2022. North American industry demand for polyolefins continues to exceed 2023, with September year-to-date polyethylene and polypropylene sales volumes up 7% and 4%, respectively. Industry exports of polyethylene are up 11% September year-to-date, with 46% of North American industry sale volumes sold in export markets. LyondellBasell's U.S. polyethylene business holds a stronger domestic market share than our local peers, with only 26% of LYB September year-to-date polyethylene volumes exported. As such, we did not experience any material disruptions during the brief port strike. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate the typical seasonal trends of softer demand and customers' desire to minimize year-end inventories could constrain price increase initiatives. In addition, sequentially, higher natural gas and ethane prices are likely to pressure integrated margins. Nonetheless, as of this week, our October North American polyethylene orders are the strongest we've seen so far in 2024. Despite volatile oil prices, the favorable oil-to-gas ratio continues to provide an advantage for North American producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. LYB remains well positioned as a leading producer in North America with strong customer relationships built over decades. During the fourth quarter, we will remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demands, targeting 85% utilization across the segment with higher cracker utilization offset by lower polypropylene rates giving the ongoing soft demand for durable goods markets. Please turn to Slide 11, as we review the results of our Olefins and Polyolefins Europe, Asia and International segment. In the third quarter, demand in the markets served by our O&P-EAI segment remains stable with no indications of macroeconomic recovery likely for the remainder of this year. The segment generated EBITDA of $81 million. Volumes declined as we began a planned turnaround at our largest cracker in Europe. Segment EBITDA improved sequentially as lower fixed and feedstock costs led to a higher integrated polyethylene margin. In the European market, we are seeing increased talk of strategic evaluations and capacity rationalizations across our peers. As in the U.S., we expect seasonal softening of demand for olefins and polyolefins. The drive for minimizing year-end inventories will also pressure European markets. In China, we are encouraged by the recent stimulus initiatives, but we have yet to see where the initiatives are resulting in improved market demand. Operationally, planned maintenance at our large Wesseling cracker in Germany will continue into the fourth quarter. As a result of this planned maintenance and softer seasonal demand, we are targeting operating rates of approximately 60% during the fourth quarter. We continue to make progress on our strategic objectives in O&P-EAI segment. Our European review is underway. In addition to starting the construction of our MoReTec-1 in September, we also acquired full ownership of APK in October, allowing us to integrate APK's unique solvent-based low-density polyethylene recycle technology as part of our comprehensive portfolio for building a profitable CLCS business. Now let's turn to Slide 12 and review the results of the Refining segment. In the third quarter, lackluster demand and high industry operating rates compressed margins and resulted in an EBITDA loss of $23 million. Crack spreads for both gasoline and distillate fuels declined during the quarter. Our distillate hedging program offset some of the margin declines. In the near-term, we expect further margin compression as the Maya 2-1-1 crack spreads continue to fall. We intend to operate at approximately 90% of capacity in the fourth quarter. We remain focused on safe and reliable operations as we move forward shutting down the refinery during the first quarter of the year. As Peter outlined earlier, our team is making good progress in evaluating strategic projects to transform the refinery site in support of our growth strategy. We have also kept the impacts of our people top of mind throughout this transformation. Since 2022 when we announced our intention to shut down the refinery, we have carefully managed staffing levels. As our staffing requirements decreased following the shutdown, we intend to retrain and redeploy as many affected employees as possible for the next stage of their careers with LYB. Nonetheless, some employees will end up leaving our company, and we will comply with all applicable laws and support our people as best possible. Now let's turn to Slide 13 and outline more details on the operational and financial impacts from that refining exit. Following the holiday season, we plan to begin shutting down the first crude and coker train during January of 2025. Then in February, we expect to begin the shutdown of the second crude and coker train, the FCC, and other ancillary units. This staged approach is designed to ensure a safe, orderly and responsible shutdown of these complex operations. The refinery shutdown impacts both earnings and cash flow. We have been accruing costs related to the shutdown on our income statement, since we announced our intentions in April 2022. However, once the shutdown begins in 2025, we will begin to realize the cash impacts depicted on this slide. During 2025, we expect to release working capital that more than offsets the cash cost of shutting down the refinery. We expect a net cash benefit of approximately $175 million during 2025, assuming a Brent crude price of $80 per barrel. We expect the Refining segment will be reported as discontinued operations from the first quarter of 2025. Within discontinued operations, the ongoing costs related to the former Refining segment are expected to be less than $50 million a year. These are the estimated costs for keeping the site safe, while maintaining operational capability for selected assets and infrastructure. With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron. I would just make a couple of additional comments, Peter, specifically around North America. I mean as we alluded to in our prepared remarks, right, you saw a feedstock advantage with ethane going into July and August. And then you saw industry down, so you saw a spike in ethylene price that challenged integrated margins. So a lot of customers looked at, as they entered September, they looked at, okay, where is ethylene price and integrated margin is going to go from where they were, and we also see a fall in crude price. So they were optimistic that the crude price would continue to fall and they would see export pricing compete with domestic pricing. And as you've seen over the last couple of weeks, the crude pricing has stabilized more. And you continue to see the demand is there for both exports as well as domestic. So that's why there's that tension and that's why October is so strong. I think there's a lot of moving parts in the macroeconomics, that you also have to contemplate what will happen with China stimulus, and will it be able to consume the new capacity to bring online. What will happen as the EU starts to rationalize? You've seen some of the announcements out there. And then in North America, you have to remember, it's the lowest cost from a feedstock perspective, for sure, region of the world, and we have no new ethylene capacity coming online for a few years. So you have to take all that into consideration as well. Yes, just a couple of comments. So thanks for asking, Josh, because it gives us the opportunity to again reemphasize this is a small investment to get into these product lines, these advanced circular product lines, by just putting a front end to our existing liquid flexible crackers, right? So when we think about how we operate in North America, I also want to reiterate, it's always about optimization, what we look at or refer to as our cost of ethylene. So yes, could we run 100% ethane at Channelview? Yes, we could, but we won't, because we -- it's more profitable for us to run some NGLs, just like it will be more profitable for us to look at the feed slate as we better understand the different feedstocks that will come in from circularity. So I think it's a great question. I really appreciate it. And I would just highlight, we had tremendous feedstock flexibility and the opportunity to get into a new market in a low cost way."

            "content": "Thank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the third quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment. Third quarter EBITDA was $19 million. The APS segment faced weaker demand, particularly in the automotive sector where third quarter global production dropped by 5% from the prior year. The automotive downturn created substantial headwinds for both volumes and pricing. Despite these market headwinds, APS continues to grow through improved win rates in critical markets and improved manufacturing efficiency. As for the third quarter year-to-date, APS EBITDA is up by more than 20% over 2023. Resilient demand from packaging markets allowed us to grow year-to-date volumes and margins in our masterbatch business relative to the first nine months of last year. And we are now realizing the cost benefits from our effort to rationalize 18 APS manufacturing sites around the world over the past six years. Looking ahead, we continue to focus on earning additional high value business by further improvements in our Net Promoter Scores and win rates with customers to restore our growth pipeline. In addition, the APS team continues to optimize working capital to improve cash flow from the business. We're investing in our core team with a growth and value mindset to deliver on our long-term goals for the APS business. With that, I will return the call back to Peter."

        "content": "Operator: Hello and welcome to the LyondellBasell Teleconference. At the request of LyondellBasell, this conference is being recorded for instant replay purposes. Following today's presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nDavid Kinney: Thank you, operator, and welcome everyone to today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies the call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations. Today we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions and the alternative measures are useful to investors. Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risk and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that can lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our investor relations website. Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer, our CFO Michael McMurray, Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins and Refining, Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives, and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. During today's call, we will focus on second quarter results as well as updates on our long-term strategy. We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Yet again, our people did an excellent job navigating challenging market conditions whilst being laser focused on the execution of our strategy. Let's begin with Slide three and discuss our continued leadership in safety performance. LYB has a history of excellence in operational performance, with safety being a core part of our success. Going back to 2010, we have consistently delivered industry-leading safety results. But more importantly, we have made significant improvements towards our goal to operate safely each day with zero incidents, injuries, or accidents. LYB's June year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.13. For comparison, in 2010, our incident rate was 0.42, more than 3x higher than today. Safety is foundational to what we do. Getting it right ensures the well-being of our workforce, but also benefits our operational excellence performance and financial returns. Our team has demonstrated outstanding focus to reach this point, and we remain committed to further improvements. Today, I'm excited to discuss our actions to deliver resilient results, as well as the excellent progress on our long-term strategy for LYB. Please turn to Slide four as we briefly review the quarter. Second quarter underlying business results improved by nearly 30% over the first quarter, driven by increased volumes from our operations. North American demand for polyolefins continues to improve, while feedstock and energy costs remain low. Our European olefins and polyolefins results improved due to our flexibility to increase our utilization of advantaged LPG feedstocks. Within intermediates and derivatives, the benefits from LYB's expanded PO/TBA capacity are clearly seen in our record quarterly oxyfuel sales volumes. Earnings were $2.24 per share, with EBITDA of $1.4 billion. LYB generated an impressive $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our strong cash generation provided support for the disciplined execution of our strategy. Let's turn to slide five and review the three-pillar strategy that is driving our focus on strategic growth and long-term value creation. As we described during fourth quarter earnings, we are making good progress on our goal to add $3 billion in incremental normalized EBITDA by 2027, with nearly one-third of that target unlocked during 2023. Last quarter we took a deeper look into how we are building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Today we will describe the work underway to grow and upgrade our core businesses. When we talk about growing and upgrading our core, we are very clear about the criteria we use to define businesses that are core to our portfolio. Moving to Slide six, let's review these criteria. We are working hard to build up a portfolio that is focused on leading market positions and growing end markets that deliver attractive returns well above our cost of capital and leverages on access to advantaged circular and renewable feedstocks. You will see that once we have executed this transformation, we will be a much more profitable, focused and streamlined company. Our decisions on investing in organic growth or disciplined M&A are grounded by our commitment to pursue attractive returns well above our cost of capital. We are leveraging LYB's technology and global market positions to increase our access to advantaged feedstocks typically found in North America and the Middle East. And finally, as we covered last quarter, we're making great progress in building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Historically, we've defined advantaged feedstocks as low-cost NGLs in North America and the Middle East. As we grow our CLCS business, we are expanding this definition to include favorable positions for circular and renewable feedstocks. As you know, we have implemented a lot of actions to grow and upgrade our portfolio in parallel with great focus and speed. May was again a busy month for us with the completion of the sale of our EO&D business and the acquisition of our stake in the NATPET joint venture. Importantly, we also announced a strategic review of some of our European assets that will reposition our footprint for future sustainable success. On Slide 7, let me highlight our goals for reshaping LYB by simultaneously growing and upgrading our core businesses. We are adding value through growth investments in, for example, our PO/TBA capacity and our formation of the NATPET joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We are also continuously evaluating projects and expect to find more opportunities that will be accretive for LYB. Our value-enhancement program is also delivering growth through incremental production capacity and improved margins. LYB's VEP is not a one-time cost-cutting initiative. Our VEP is our new way of working, focused on unlocking value and is becoming embedded in LYB's culture. Michael will share some more details on our VEP progress in a few moments. Our motivation for upgrading the portfolio is illustrated on the right side of Slide 7. In some cases, upgrades are accomplished by divesting or exiting non-core businesses. One example is the Houston Refinery, a capital-intensive asset that has historically only delivered brief periods of profitability. After we shut down the refinery by no later than the end of the first quarter 2025, LYB's average EBITDA margin will actually expand by about four percentage points. Our divested ethylene oxide and derivatives business did not provide LYB with a leading position and did not fit our criteria for growth. Simply put, we were not the best owners. The strategic review of our European assets will position our footprint for a sustainable future. All of these moves aim toward building a stronger, more focused and more profitable business portfolio for LYB. Let's drill into our European strategic review on Slide 8. We are undertaking this review to position LYB's regional footprint for future markets. Our goal is to reshape our European business portfolio in alignment with our long-term strategy for lasting success. Europe remains a core market for LYB. Our analysis determines that the six assets listed on the top left in their current configuration do not meet LYB's criteria for a core business. At this point, all options are on the table. Just like our ethylene oxide and derivatives business, these assets could well have a strategic fit and profitable future with another owner. Divestiture of the assets as a group or separately is a possibility. Or we may determine that, like our Houston refinery, rationalization is the best option for some sites. While it is too early to speculate on the outcomes, the impact on the company's global portfolio is relatively limited. As you can glean from the chart, the assets subject to review only represent about 13% of our global capacity for these product lines. LYB will continue to have a strong European presence. In I&D, our core European assets utilize LYB's world-leading PO/TBA technology. In Germany, we are investing near Cologne to build our first circular and renewable solutions hub. And our technology segment will maintain a strong presence in Italy and Germany. We will continue productive engagement with all relevant stakeholders at the impacted sites. This includes local governments, our business partners, potential buyers, and most importantly, our employees, who continue to demonstrate high commitment to safe, reliable and efficient operations, despite the ongoing uncertainty. Our aim is to move swiftly to maximize value for LYB and all stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to discuss our financial results in more detail.\nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide nine. And let me start by discussing our resilient cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $4.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at an impressive 95% cash conversion rate during the last 12 months. As a result, we were able to return almost $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This represents nearly 70% of our $2.6 billion of free cash flow, in line with our long-term target. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $2.9 billion. Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our second quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated an impressive $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we returned $513 million through dividends and share repurchases, while funding $484 million of capital investment. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.34 per share, continuing our track record of providing a secure, growing, and competitive dividend for our shareholders. Our team is committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation as part of our long-term strategy. During the quarter, we divested the ethylene oxide and derivatives business for $700 million. Within a few weeks, we invested approximately $500 million to acquire a 35% share of NATPET integrated polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We finished the second quarter with approximately $7 billion of available liquidity. In July, LYB successfully amended and extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to 2029, while further strengthening our liquidity by increasing the size of the facility by $500 million to $3.75 billion. Let's continue with a brief update on our VEP progress on Slide 11. The Value Enhancement Program is a highly successful and integral component of our long-term strategy. We are confident in our estimate that the VEP will contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. Our team is rapidly delivering value less than two years after first launching this program. To provide more detail on this year's progress, we have broken out contributions by business segment and category. As you might expect, the segment with the largest contribution is also our most profitable segment, O&P Americas, generating about $265 million of incremental value. In 2024, we anticipate approximately $280 million of benefit across the company from improved product mix and increased variable margins. We anticipate about $95 million of benefit from higher volume, driven by improving reliability and increased rates. While the Value Enhancement Program is primarily focused on increased value generation, the program has also identified opportunities to improve our leading fixed cost position. Overall, we estimate that lower fixed costs across our manufacturing and corporate functions will benefit our results by approximately $25 million this year. As Peter mentioned, LYB's VEP program is a new way of working and unlocking value that is becoming embedded as an evergreen process in our culture. Let's turn to Slide 12 and I will provide a brief overview of the results of each of our segments. LYB's business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter, almost 30% higher than the prior quarter. Seasonal summer demand, coupled with higher production from our asset base, led to increased volumes. Margins modestly improved across most of our businesses. In early July, Hurricane Beryl impacted our operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast. LYB proactively shut down some of our assets ahead of the storm. Our prudent approach reduces the potential for damage to our assets and the surrounding community during adverse conditions. As a result, we did not experience any workplace injuries and property damage was not material. Nonetheless, we estimate that storm-related downtime will impact third quarter EBITDA by approximately $65 million, with approximately 75% in our O&P America segment. We have relatively modest levels of maintenance activity planned for the remainder of the year. In the appendix to this slide deck, we provide updated 2024 modeling guidance for planned maintenance impacts and other financial metrics. With a sharp focus on working capital, we continue to align our operating rates to meet market demand. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets, 80% for our European olefins and polyolefin assets, and 75% for intermediates and derivative assets. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Kim?\nKim Foley: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of the olefins and polyolefins America segment. During the second quarter, O&P America's EBITDA was $670 million. Increased LYB production led to higher volumes and margins. We were pleased to see that integrated polyethylene margins were supported by modestly higher ethylene and polyethylene prices, while ethane and natural gas costs remain low. Demand for North American polyolefins is strengthening in 2024, with June year-to-date industry polyethylene sales up by nearly 11% over the first half of 2023. Strong demand pull from both domestic and export markets is absorbing recent capacity expansions in the region. LYB is well positioned as the third largest polyethylene producer in North America, with strong customer relationships built over decades. In the third quarter, we anticipate continued seasonal demand strength. Low feedstock and energy costs are expected to persist, benefiting North American integrated polyolefin margins. Amid a backdrop of relatively high oil prices, the favorable oil-to-gas ratio provides an advantage to North American producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. Despite disruptions from Hurricane Beryl in early July, the U.S. olefins and polyolefins markets remain well supplied. Nonetheless, the U.S. Gulf Coast hurricane season is still young, with potential for additional disruptions over the coming months. During the third quarter, we will remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand, targeting 85% utilization. After a decade of unprecedented growth, North American polyolefins capacity additions have slowed down. Please turn to Slide 14 as you review the changing outlook for our new supply. In the early 2010s, the advent of shale-based oil and gas production triggered a wave of olefins and polyolefins capacity additions to take advantage of the abundant and low-cost NGL feedstocks. With one or sometimes two world-scale plants coming online nearly every year for over the past decade, North American domestic and export markets for polyethylene and polypropylene became well supplied, leading to reduced operating rates and lower margins. Over the next few years, very little new capacity will come online in North America. After two years of tepid growth, polyethylene sales volumes are growing at double-digit rates during the first half of this year. Demand growth in Latin America is increasingly served by North American supply. Polypropylene volumes are also improving, but remain constrained as we await the inevitable rebound in demand for durable goods. With North American demand growth returning to long-term trends and no meaningful local supply on the horizon, tightening supply and demand balances and higher utilization rates bode well for LyondellBasell's core polyolefins business. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the results of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia, and international segment. In the second quarter, LYB's integrated polyethylene margins expanded with the increased utilization of cost-advantaged feedstocks such as LPGs, resulting in EBITDA of $70 million. Approximately 40% of LYB's European ethylene production came from advantaged feedstocks. Additionally, higher prices for olefins and coproducts supported European cracker margins amidst modest seasonal demand improvement for polymers. Red Sea logistic challenges have largely subsided during the quarter, but significant higher shipping costs constrain European imports, benefiting local producers. Looking ahead, we anticipate steady olefins and polyolefins demand through the summer in Europe. In September, we will begin planned maintenance at one of our German crackers that will continue into the fourth quarter. As a result, we are targeting approximately 80% operating rates for the third quarter. As part of our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses, we completed the acquisition of a 35% share of the Saudi Arabian NATPET joint venture at the end of May. The joint venture currently operates 400,000 tons of integrated polypropylene capacity using local cost-advantaged propane raw materials and LYB's ferrous polypropylene technology. Together with our partner Alujain, we are evaluating opportunities to significantly grow the joint venture by leveraging new feedstock concessions in Saudi Arabia. And as Peter discussed, in May, we also announced the strategic review of some of our European olefins and polyolefins assets. Our team is working diligently to evaluate our options and order position LYB for future success in the region. Now let's turn to Slide 16 and review the results of the refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $15 million. Higher production following the first quarter downtime was more than offset by lower mire crack spreads. Margins decreased driven by lower distillate cracks, partially offset by slight improvements in gasoline cracks, with modest second quarter demand indicating a slow start to the driving season. Our hedging program benefited second quarter results. Industry operating rates remained relatively high, leading to ample market supply. In the near term, we expect summer demand to support stable gasoline crack spreads and continued high operating rates for refiners. We intend to operate at approximately 90% of capacity in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets until we shut down, no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. Additional details regarding our ramp down will be provided during our third quarter update. Our team is making good progress in evaluating projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron.\nAaron Ledet: Thank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 17 as we look at the intermediates and derivatives segment. In the second quarter, segment EBITDA was $501 million, driven by increased production and seasonal demand for oxyfuels. We delivered record quarterly oxyfuels volumes by increasing production from our newest PO/TBA asset, which operated at close to benchmark rates during the quarter. Oxyfuels margins remain robust as the summer driving season is underway, with strong octane demand keeping margins well above historical levels. Intermediate chemicals improved due to higher margins and volumes for acetyls, driven by industry outages and improved production from LYB's assets. Propylene oxide and derivatives margins were steady, as demand for durable goods remain modest against a backdrop of high interest rates in the impacts of inflation. As we move through the third quarter, we expect seasonal demand will continue to benefit oxyfuels margins through the remainder of the driving season. Low costs for butane raw materials and steady premiums for octane should provide continued support for oxyfuels profitability. In line with our guidance, planned maintenance at one of our Bayport PO/TBA assets will begin later in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our I&D assets at rates of approximately 75% during the quarter. As Michael mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of our ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses to INEOS for $700 million. During the second quarter, we recorded a book gain on the sale of $293 million, which is reflected as an identified item in our second quarter results. Our work to grow and upgrade our I&D segment continues as we evaluate our Maasvlakte POSM joint venture in the Netherlands as part of the ongoing European strategic review. We are working closely with our partner in the JV, Covestro, local stakeholders in our workforce. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.\nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the second quarter results for the advanced polymer solution segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $40 million. Margins increased across most APS businesses as our transformation work and seasonal improvements led to modestly higher pricing. Lower automotive production in Europe led to a slight decrease in volumes. Looking ahead, we expect modest improvement in volumes through the remainder of the year, driven by our strategic initiatives and focus on restoring our growth pipeline. We anticipate headwinds from typical seasonal downtime at automotive OEMs in the third quarter, but our master batch business assured a qualification cycles and offered more opportunities for near-term improvement. Our team is focused on continuously expanding our growth funnel and increasing the win rate with our customers. We're investing in our core team with a growth and value mindset to deliver on our long-term goals for the APS business. With that, I will return the call back to Peter.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19 and I will discuss the result for the technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $84 million reflected moderating licensing and catalyst revenue, normalizing after strong first quarter results. In the third quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will increase, coupled with high catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that third quarter technology segment results will be similar to first quarter results. Now let me summarize the second quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy with Slide 20. LYB's second quarter results reflect higher production volumes and modest seasonal improvements in market conditions. Looking toward the second half of the year, we continue to expect a slight improvement over our first half results with a slow recovery in global markets. LYB's assets in the U.S. and Middle East are well positioned, operating in regions where low costs for energy and feed stocks provide a durable competitive advantage relative to oil-based production. Our team remains disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and delivering high returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we are well equipped to succeed as market conditions modestly improve. Our value enhancement program is on track to contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. We are thrilled with the enthusiasm and results from our progress so far and look forward to providing a more substantive update on our VEP next quarter as we dive deeper on how we are stepping up our performance and culture at LYB. At our Capital Markets Day last year, we outlined our long-term strategy. Through leading technologies and market positions, we are executing on this strategy to grow our global footprint and upgrade our core businesses. Our strategy will not only grow LYB but will also reshape our business portfolio to improve profitability and create sustainable competitive advantages. As Kim highlighted earlier, we see North American polyolefin demand improving in 2024, returning to work long-term historical growth rates. As we look ahead, limited capacity additions in North America bodes well for continued improvements in operating rates and associated margins over the coming years. I am proud to lead our high-performing team as we take decisive actions to unlock value, reshape LYB, and position our company for sustainable future success. With that, we're now pleased to take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Byrne: You're planning to shutter the refinery at the end of the first quarter, and I know that you have considered some other options for that facility, such as becoming a plastic recycling center. I think you also offered it as a hydrogen hub. My question for you is, are any of those plans contingent on funding from the DOE, which could potentially get scuttled if there was an administration change? And can you provide a little bit of, I guess, transparency on that two million ton, 1 billion EBITDA target you have by the end of the decade? What type of circular products do you expect to be generating that?\nPeter Vanacker: Hi Steve, thank you very much for your question and warm welcome from my side. On the refinery, we have announced that multiple times and it's again in our prepared remarks that we plan at the latest to run down the refinery at the latest at the end of Q1 2025. In the meantime, our teams are making very good progress with regards, I mean, to a couple of projects that we have alluded to before. One of them is our second investment in MoReTec. The first one, remember, is in the Cologne hub next to our steam crackers in Wesseling. The second one we plan to bring to the Houston refinery. Leverage upon the hydrotreaters we have, modify those hydrotreaters so we can upgrade the plastic oil that is being produced in MoReTec number two. And that plastic oil would then be supplied to our steam crackers through pipelines in, for example, Channelview. So that's one project that is proceeding well. I hope that we will take a first decision, a first milestone decision on that still this year. The second project is around the renewable hydrocarbons. So these are not plastic waste type hydrocarbons, but hydrocarbons eventually produced out of used cooking oil or other wastes. We see also opportunities to leverage upon the equipment we have at the refinery to produce those renewable hydrocarbons as a feedstock in our refinery in Houston. And again, the same principle, those hydrocarbons would then go through our pipelines to Channelview, to the steam crackers, and then based upon that we would crack them and we would polymerize them. So we have then two elements of our Circulen family. One, the advanced recycling part based upon the MoReTec investment, and the other one, the renew part, which is based upon renewable hydrocarbons. So all that is proceeding well, as we had alluded to in the past.\nMichael McMurray: And hey Steve, it's Michael. I would say that a lot of the hydrogen projects are probably challenged without subsidies. And then before we move on to the next question, I wanted to clarify something. We received a lot of questions around our operating rates this morning from the materials that we had posted online. So let me see if I can clarify a few points for you all. In April, we guided to second quarter operating rates for the segment as 85% for both O&P Americas and O&P EAI, and 80% for intermediates and derivatives. Our rates for the second quarter were largely in line with that guidance. In the business results discussion posted on our website, we disclosed second quarter cracker operating rates were 95% for O&P Americas and 90% for O&P EAI. We operated our crackers in both regions at higher rates during the second quarter to capture favorable economics for olefins. Our polymer plants operated at lower rates to match second quarter market demand for polymers. As Kim and Aaron mentioned, during the third quarter, we will operate the O&P Americas segment at 85%, O&P EAI at 80%, and I&D at 75%. In O&P Americas, we proactively took some downtime during Hurricane Beryl that will reduce rates by about five percentage points for the third quarter. In EAI, we are starting a turnaround on our larger cracker and Wesseling during the third quarter. We expect our crackers in both regions will operate at higher rates than the segment to continue to capture attractive margins for ethylene, propylene, and other co-products. In I&D, we are performing a turnaround on one of our older PO/TBA plants in Bayport, Texas during the third quarter. In addition, we're taking some downtime at our POSM joint venture in the Netherlands to balance the low market demand for propylene oxide and styrene in the region. If you have any further questions on rates, please feel free to reach out to the IR team for further clarification. Next question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with TPH. Please proceed with your question.\nMatthew Blair: I have some questions on the PO side. So, you mentioned the benefits of the new PO/TBA plant in Channelview. Could you give us the approximate EBITDA contribution in the quarter or at least some guidance on how the run rate stacks up to your mid-cycle target of 400 million to 500 million on an annual basis? The release also mentioned some volume improvements in PO. Can you talk about which end markets are picking up? And then finally, can you talk about the supply-demand outlook here? I think there's a fair amount of new China PO capacity on deck for the back half of this year. Thank you.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Matthew, and welcome as well to you. On propylene oxide, if you talk about the new facility, the PO/TBA facility that we have successfully started up last year, I'm very pleased, I mean, to say that we ran close, I mean, to 90% during Q2 in terms of capacity utilization. I think that's based upon my 34 years in the industry. That's a huge success because that's a major investment that we have made to be able to run pretty much close to nameplate capacity of such a facility and such a relatively short period of time of ramping up. So with that, I will also hand over to Aaron to give a little bit more background on the market supply and demand.\nAaron Ledet: Yeah, thank you, Peter, and thank you for the question. I would say that as we look at overall PO demand, as many of you know, most of it goes into durable applications with roughly two-thirds going into the polyurethane chain. We have not seen any rebound from durables, at least noticeable rebound from durables over the first part of this year. We don't expect it to rebound either in the second half of the year. We remain optimistic that the rate cuts will have an impact on us, although they won't be immediate. The other third demand for PO really comes through derivatives and glycols and BDO, and we're also, while glycols might be a little bit better than what we were anticipating, BDO remains somewhat modest. So generally speaking, PO demand is relatively modest right now.\nPeter Vanacker: I do want to add, I mean, just on the big picture, now we've alluded to that in the past as well, one needs to look at the total different capacities to produce propylene oxide, and still in the world, I would say approximately half of the capacities are based upon chlorohydrin technology, which is a technology that is older, has higher CO2 emissions, is more costly. And actually on January 8, 2024, the China National Development and Reform Commission, the so-called NDRC, announced a ban on most of the chlorohydrin-based PO technology by the end of 2025. So we estimate about 25% of China propylene oxide is chlorohydrin technology. So if you see that that is going to be banned, and you look at that compared to the additional investments in propylene oxide that have been taking place in China, it's probably going to, these rationalizations will partially offset, if not fully offset, I mean the new capacity in China.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. Please proceed with your question.\nFrank Mitsch: Good morning. I had a question on the cash flow side of things, given the positive cash flow generation and solid balance sheet here, you dipped your toes back into the buyback markets here in the second quarter. Curious what your outlook is for the balance of the year there, and whether or not, there might be other scope for M&A, etc. So, just generally the uses of cash question. Thank you.\nPeter Vanacker: Of course, I'm very pleased, I mean, to say that the total capital return yield of Q2 was 6%. So I think that's very attractive. Michael, you want to add something on the question of Frank?\nMichael McMurray: Yes. So thanks for the question, Frank. I mean, just a couple of things. I mean, you know that we have a reputation as a company for delivering strong free cash flow and converting EBITDA into cash. In the last 12 months, we generated 4.4 billions, which is 95% conversion, which is well ahead of our 80%. And just kind of thinking about the year itself, as Peter alluded, we grew our dividend. And we did some buybacks as well in the quarter. As we look to the second half, I think buybacks will continue to be in the mix, probably somewhat modestly, so we're still being a little bit cautious. But from a long-term perspective, the 70% guidance of returning free cash flow to our investors is fully, fully in place, and we're fully committed to it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Roberts: I know Eastman has a very different circular plastics program than Lyondell. But would it seem that their operational initial problems, and they've got some delays in customer adoptions, would that be common, I think, to all circular plastics initiatives here? So is that giving you any concerns about your 2030 targets, 5.5 years from now is actually a pretty short timeframe for chemical investments.\nPeter Vanacker: John, welcome as well, and thank you for your question. Of course, technologies are difficult to compare, I mean, to one each other. What I can say on our MoReTec technology, we have a unit which is up and running in our Ferrara plants, where we also have our R&D people in Italy. So that is not an industrial scale plant, but it's not a lab scale either. It's not a small plant. I mean, this is about four stores, I mean, five, I mean, the plant. So we have very good experience, I mean, with that. The scope, I mean, on the MoReTec 1 investment has been finalized, and we're starting to prepare, I mean, on the grounds, on the investments. So that is proceeding well in Westerling, so for our Cologne hub. Our process is, as I said multiple times, is different than practically any other process that you find out there, because it is a catalytic process, leveraging upon our vast experience we have in catalysis.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Begleiter: Thank you, good morning. Peter, in your expectation of higher second half results versus the first half, what are you betting for polyethylene price increases, and included specifically in July as well? Thank you.\nPeter Vanacker: Well, David, welcome and thank you for your question as well. I mean, if you look at the first half of this year, from a group perspective, of course, then Q1 was better than Q4 last year. Now Q2 was better than Q1. Quite impressively, I mean, 29% better than Q1. Another point that I want to make is, if you now exclude the refinery business, which, as we alluded to before in the call, is going to end its operations, it's a different environment in refining than what we have seen last year. So if you compare Q2 results without refining for this year with Q2 results without refining last year, then our results are better than last year. So the core business is improving as we are progressing. Now to your question on the second half of this year, if you look, I mean, what we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we expect that ethane will remain cheap. There are two $0.05 per pound North American polyethylene price increases in the market. Kim said practically all increased capacity in North America has been absorbed through demand growth as well as exports, record exports. We don't see any inventory buildup throughout the value chain. And we're only at the beginning of the hurricane season. So if you look at all these things, then one would expect that we have a very good momentum, and that should support, I mean, also price increases for polyethylene. We will have to see, of course, how much of the two times $0.05 per pound price increases are out there, but at least you see the momentum in the North American market, which should support, I mean, these price increases.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed with your question.\nKevin McCarthy: Peter, I appreciate the detail on slide eight regarding your ongoing review of the European asset footprint. Can you provide a little bit more color about, you know, how you arrived at these decisions, but perhaps more importantly, you know, which of the three buckets that you outline, you know, in terms of upgrading profit, divesting, or rationalizing might be more likely, and what does the timeline look like for the evaluation moving forward?\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you very much, Kevin. Good question. Of course, I mean, it's not a lot that in addition that we can disclose at this point in time, because we continue to keep all the options open, but as you know, we have made the announcement in the market, so by having made the announcement in the market, that allows us to also have discussions with potential other owners for those assets. I need to differentiate a little bit, like you saw on slide number eight. One part is around propylene oxide, so the POSM units that we have in the Maasvlakte, which is a 50-50 joint venture with Covestro. So that is a bit different, of course, than if you compare, I mean, to the cracker/PEPP sites that we have identified within the scope. So, progressing well, I would say, we're not excluding any opportunity that we have at this point in time, and one thing that I can say is, we are very diligent, we're laser focused, and we will not delay the actions that need to be taken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Perrella: Good morning, everyone. It's Chris Perrella on for Josh. Taking a look at the second half guidance, the maintenance, thank you for the updated maintenance schedule, the maintenance looks relatively similar, half over half. I know there's the barrel impact. I was just trying to -- could you add some more color on sort of the moving parts? Is it a seasonal decline in the earnings, or weighing on the earnings in the second half, or what's slowing the momentum that you saw in the second quarter there?\nPeter Vanacker: Well, we continue to see that there is momentum being built up. I talked already a bit on PE, so if you look at PE, you see that just the U.S. domestic demand in Q2 was up by 4% versus Q1, which, just to remind everybody, this is the strongest quarter since two years. Exports were up, let's say, around 8%, 9% versus May and June, so they were, these exports, about the second highest, I mean, all time, and I alluded to the price increases that we have in the marketplace. The same is also a bit valid, I mean, on polypropylene, so we, I mean, demand continues to improve, of course we're still waiting for inflation rates to go down, we're still waiting as a consequence for interest rates to go down, so that consumer confidence would go up, especially for durable goods, but in polypropylene, we see that even if consumer confidence remains low, that there is a bit of improvements already in some other areas, like rigid packaging, seat, films. Our order book is also quite full on polyethylene and polypropylene, so we're happy with that as well. The main issue that continues to be is around China. China demand, we have seen slowly going up, we think around 4%, 5% locally, but that is being absorbed with the additional capacity that is coming on stream. Europe continues to be soft, but then there is some encouraging messages, numbers that we see, especially on the southern part of Europe, the southern countries with higher GDP growth, higher demands, and we see that inflation rates continue to slowly go down in Europe as well. So if you look at everything together, we see a slow increase, a continued increase in terms of demand, so if you talk about these capacity utilization percentages, and Michael made some clarifications on that, it's not so much, I mean, for the second half of the year, because we see and we are worried about demand growth, it's mainly because of our own actions that we have, because if you have a scheduled turnaround on our big cracker that we have in Wesseling in Europe, well, of course, I mean, that gives you lesser capacity that you have available. But rest assured, I mean, we continue to see continuous slow, but good momentum, steady momentum in terms of demand creation.\nMichael McMurray: So flattish to Q3, slightly up second half versus first half, and then Chris, that seasonally, the first and fourth quarters tend to be the weakest, with seasonally, the second and third, the strongest, just as a reminder.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. Please proceed with your question.\nHassan Ahmed: Joined the call late, so apologies if this question's been asked before. But you know, a question around the I&D side of things. Historically, the EBITDA in that segment used to be quite stable. And then over the last year or two, there was some volatility there as well. And obviously, you guys saw a nice bump up in EBITDA this quarter, partly obviously driven by the oxyfuel side of things. I'm just trying to sort of suss out what, how you guys think about the sustainability of these profitability levels. And historically -- a continuation of the historically sort of steady, eddy nature of this business.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Hassan. Thank you for your question. I made a couple of remarks. I mean, it was more around propylene oxide. But maybe I hand over since I have Aaron also in the room here, and he's heading the I&D business, as you know, that he can make a couple of additional comments around the PO, the oxyfuels business.\nAaron Ledet: Yes. Thank you, Peter. I appreciate it. And thanks for the question, Hassan. I point to a couple of different things. I agree with your comment about IND historical earnings being very steady. We sold the EOD business in the second quarter. So you have to consider removing that from that profile. However, we've added the PO/TBA facility and we're now operating that facility better than planned rates close to benchmark. As I look forward, given the challenges that we're currently seeing with durable demand, specifically in automotive, housing and construction, we are optimizing our PO assets according to technology. We've already talked to the benefit that we see with PO/TBA. And that's why we're running all of those assets close to benchmark with POSM assets being more like swing assets to meet supply with demand. And when you're looking specifically at possum, we would actually prioritize our U.S. assets, just giving our cost position. And that's why the comment that Michael made earlier on PO 11 being idled in August, it's reflecting current demand in the region. That being said, I still expect that IND remains steady going forward. I mentioned earlier in my answer to the previous question that with interest rates potentially coming down, we do see some potential upside. That's not currently built into our forecast and it won't be immediate, but we do see some potential upside there.\nPeter Vanacker: Of course, we're very well positioned because we have that new PO TBA plans that is running very well. So if durable good demand starts moving up, then we have the capacity available to fulfill the demands.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Parkinson: I just want to dive in a little bit more into polypropylene dynamics. I mean, it seems like U.S. supplies are telling you towards the end of the decade, but you have seen increases in other regions of the world. So just in terms of how you're thinking about the supply and demand dynamics on that front, as well as your current use of feedstock costs would be particularly helpful to hear you think about the business as we go into 25. Thank you so much.\nPeter Vanacker: Thank you, Chris. I mean, before I hand over to Kim, let me elaborate also that we saw -- despite the fact, I mean, that really durable goods is demand is not really yet going up substantially. But domestic demand in the United States for polypropylene was up about 5% versus Q1, which means that this is the strongest quarter in polypropylene that we have seen since Q3 2021. So with that, Kim.\nKim Foley: So Peter, I guess what I would add to that is when you when you ask about the overall kind of global dynamics, you've seen a lot of growth in polypropylene, specifically in China, over the last couple years. So what you're seeing play out is more of a regional market, you're, it's much less of an export market than what you see in polyethylene, polypropylene, you know, just to compare and contrast polypropylene, you may export 8% to 10% in the US versus polyethylene, where it would be more like 40% or 50%. So it's a much more regional dynamic. And that dynamic is based on the feedstock to your question around feedstocks. So what is your cost of propylene in different parts of the world, whether you're getting it from refining, whether you're getting it from on purpose PDH units. And then the thing that's really an interesting dynamic in North America, specifically right now is the reliability of that supply of propylene. There's been a lot of PDH capacity that's been brought online, as people have been phasing out propylene coming out of elephant crackers as they've gone to lighter ethane feedstocks. So you see on purpose PDH, having reliability problems, and you're seeing higher, what we would call propylene grade, polypropylene causing the problems. So I hope that answers your question. I apologize. There were some other things going on here in the room.\nChris Parkinson: All good. Very much so. Thank you so much.\nPeter Vanacker: And Chris, we also have a spread improvement price increase. I mean, that is on the table in the market for North America for July of three cents per pound on polypropylene.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes to the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nTurner Hinrichs: Hi, this is Turner Hendricks on for Vincent. It looks like in EAI, you ran at 60% NATPET when I think you can run typically with more propane. Was that because there were attractive NATPET co-product values or something else?\nKim Foley: Yes. Your simple answer is yes. There were very good co-product values, especially in butadiene, as well as we felt that that was the best optimization of our European crackers at the time. As we've said in the past, and, you know, we'll just reiterate it because I think it's very important, whether it's in Europe or in the U.S., we are always looking week to week to optimize the feedstock slate of our crackers and produce the best value for LYB. It's not always ethylene. Sometimes it's the co-product.\nOperator: Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll turn back over to Mr. Vanacker for closing comments.\nPeter Vanacker: Yes, thank you very much. Excuse me. Thank you again for all of the thoughtful questions. Let me maybe still articulate a couple of key messages of this call. I believe that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to make LYB a much more focused company with a leading advantaged asset portfolio, as well as product mix. And why am I saying that? I mean, first of all, we're making good progress on our goal to add $3 billion in incremental normalized EBITDA by 2027. Secondly, you see that we have clear actions to increase our historical average EBITDA margin from 18% to above 22% percent. Third, our second quarter due to capital return yield at 6% that we have due to an increased dividend and also some share buybacks is, I think, quite state-of-the-art. And fourth, our current cost advantaged operations in feedstock advantaged regions without our refining is already about 60% of LyondellBasell's production volume. And after we have implemented our European strategic assessment, we expect that that will grow to around 70%. So let's say in a couple of years. So, of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on all aspects of our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend. Stay well, stay healthy and stay safe. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Aaron Ledet",
            "content": "Thank you, Kim. Please turn to Slide 17 as we look at the intermediates and derivatives segment. In the second quarter, segment EBITDA was $501 million, driven by increased production and seasonal demand for oxyfuels. We delivered record quarterly oxyfuels volumes by increasing production from our newest PO/TBA asset, which operated at close to benchmark rates during the quarter. Oxyfuels margins remain robust as the summer driving season is underway, with strong octane demand keeping margins well above historical levels. Intermediate chemicals improved due to higher margins and volumes for acetyls, driven by industry outages and improved production from LYB's assets. Propylene oxide and derivatives margins were steady, as demand for durable goods remain modest against a backdrop of high interest rates in the impacts of inflation. As we move through the third quarter, we expect seasonal demand will continue to benefit oxyfuels margins through the remainder of the driving season. Low costs for butane raw materials and steady premiums for octane should provide continued support for oxyfuels profitability. In line with our guidance, planned maintenance at one of our Bayport PO/TBA assets will begin later in the third quarter and continue into the fourth quarter. We will continue to match our production with market demand and expect to operate our I&D assets at rates of approximately 75% during the quarter. As Michael mentioned earlier, we completed the sale of our ethylene oxide and derivatives businesses to INEOS for $700 million. During the second quarter, we recorded a book gain on the sale of $293 million, which is reflected as an identified item in our second quarter results. Our work to grow and upgrade our I&D segment continues as we evaluate our Maasvlakte POSM joint venture in the Netherlands as part of the ongoing European strategic review. We are working closely with our partner in the JV, Covestro, local stakeholders in our workforce. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. Yeah, thank you, Peter, and thank you for the question. I would say that as we look at overall PO demand, as many of you know, most of it goes into durable applications with roughly two-thirds going into the polyurethane chain. We have not seen any rebound from durables, at least noticeable rebound from durables over the first part of this year. We don't expect it to rebound either in the second half of the year. We remain optimistic that the rate cuts will have an impact on us, although they won't be immediate. The other third demand for PO really comes through derivatives and glycols and BDO, and we're also, while glycols might be a little bit better than what we were anticipating, BDO remains somewhat modest. So generally speaking, PO demand is relatively modest right now. Yes. Thank you, Peter. I appreciate it. And thanks for the question, Hassan. I point to a couple of different things. I agree with your comment about IND historical earnings being very steady. We sold the EOD business in the second quarter. So you have to consider removing that from that profile.

            "name": "Peter Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, Dave, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our second quarter results. Yet again, our people did an excellent job navigating challenging market conditions whilst being laser focused on the execution of our strategy. Let's begin with Slide three and discuss our continued leadership in safety performance. LYB has a history of excellence in operational performance, with safety being a core part of our success. Going back to 2010, we have consistently delivered industry-leading safety results. But more importantly, we have made significant improvements towards our goal to operate safely each day with zero incidents, injuries, or accidents. LYB's June year-to-date total recordable incident rate for employees and contractors is 0.13. For comparison, in 2010, our incident rate was 0.42, more than 3x higher than today. Safety is foundational to what we do. Getting it right ensures the well-being of our workforce, but also benefits our operational excellence performance and financial returns. Our team has demonstrated outstanding focus to reach this point, and we remain committed to further improvements. Today, I'm excited to discuss our actions to deliver resilient results, as well as the excellent progress on our long-term strategy for LYB. Please turn to Slide four as we briefly review the quarter. Second quarter underlying business results improved by nearly 30% over the first quarter, driven by increased volumes from our operations. North American demand for polyolefins continues to improve, while feedstock and energy costs remain low. Our European olefins and polyolefins results improved due to our flexibility to increase our utilization of advantaged LPG feedstocks. Within intermediates and derivatives, the benefits from LYB's expanded PO/TBA capacity are clearly seen in our record quarterly oxyfuel sales volumes. Earnings were $2.24 per share, with EBITDA of $1.4 billion. LYB generated an impressive $1.3 billion in cash from operating activities. Our strong cash generation provided support for the disciplined execution of our strategy. Let's turn to slide five and review the three-pillar strategy that is driving our focus on strategic growth and long-term value creation. As we described during fourth quarter earnings, we are making good progress on our goal to add $3 billion in incremental normalized EBITDA by 2027, with nearly one-third of that target unlocked during 2023. Last quarter we took a deeper look into how we are building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Today we will describe the work underway to grow and upgrade our core businesses. When we talk about growing and upgrading our core, we are very clear about the criteria we use to define businesses that are core to our portfolio. Moving to Slide six, let's review these criteria. We are working hard to build up a portfolio that is focused on leading market positions and growing end markets that deliver attractive returns well above our cost of capital and leverages on access to advantaged circular and renewable feedstocks. You will see that once we have executed this transformation, we will be a much more profitable, focused and streamlined company. Our decisions on investing in organic growth or disciplined M&A are grounded by our commitment to pursue attractive returns well above our cost of capital. We are leveraging LYB's technology and global market positions to increase our access to advantaged feedstocks typically found in North America and the Middle East. And finally, as we covered last quarter, we're making great progress in building a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. Historically, we've defined advantaged feedstocks as low-cost NGLs in North America and the Middle East. As we grow our CLCS business, we are expanding this definition to include favorable positions for circular and renewable feedstocks. As you know, we have implemented a lot of actions to grow and upgrade our portfolio in parallel with great focus and speed. May was again a busy month for us with the completion of the sale of our EO&D business and the acquisition of our stake in the NATPET joint venture. Importantly, we also announced a strategic review of some of our European assets that will reposition our footprint for future sustainable success. On Slide 7, let me highlight our goals for reshaping LYB by simultaneously growing and upgrading our core businesses. We are adding value through growth investments in, for example, our PO/TBA capacity and our formation of the NATPET joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We are also continuously evaluating projects and expect to find more opportunities that will be accretive for LYB. Our value-enhancement program is also delivering growth through incremental production capacity and improved margins. LYB's VEP is not a one-time cost-cutting initiative. Our VEP is our new way of working, focused on unlocking value and is becoming embedded in LYB's culture. Michael will share some more details on our VEP progress in a few moments. Our motivation for upgrading the portfolio is illustrated on the right side of Slide 7. In some cases, upgrades are accomplished by divesting or exiting non-core businesses. One example is the Houston Refinery, a capital-intensive asset that has historically only delivered brief periods of profitability. After we shut down the refinery by no later than the end of the first quarter 2025, LYB's average EBITDA margin will actually expand by about four percentage points. Our divested ethylene oxide and derivatives business did not provide LYB with a leading position and did not fit our criteria for growth. Simply put, we were not the best owners. The strategic review of our European assets will position our footprint for a sustainable future. All of these moves aim toward building a stronger, more focused and more profitable business portfolio for LYB. Let's drill into our European strategic review on Slide 8. We are undertaking this review to position LYB's regional footprint for future markets. Our goal is to reshape our European business portfolio in alignment with our long-term strategy for lasting success. Europe remains a core market for LYB. Our analysis determines that the six assets listed on the top left in their current configuration do not meet LYB's criteria for a core business. At this point, all options are on the table. Just like our ethylene oxide and derivatives business, these assets could well have a strategic fit and profitable future with another owner. Divestiture of the assets as a group or separately is a possibility. Or we may determine that, like our Houston refinery, rationalization is the best option for some sites. While it is too early to speculate on the outcomes, the impact on the company's global portfolio is relatively limited. As you can glean from the chart, the assets subject to review only represent about 13% of our global capacity for these product lines. LYB will continue to have a strong European presence. In I&D, our core European assets utilize LYB's world-leading PO/TBA technology. In Germany, we are investing near Cologne to build our first circular and renewable solutions hub. And our technology segment will maintain a strong presence in Italy and Germany. We will continue productive engagement with all relevant stakeholders at the impacted sites. This includes local governments, our business partners, potential buyers, and most importantly, our employees, who continue to demonstrate high commitment to safe, reliable and efficient operations, despite the ongoing uncertainty. Our aim is to move swiftly to maximize value for LYB and all stakeholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Michael to discuss our financial results in more detail. Thank you, Torkel. Please turn to Slide 19 and I will discuss the result for the technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. Second quarter EBITDA of $84 million reflected moderating licensing and catalyst revenue, normalizing after strong first quarter results. In the third quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will increase, coupled with high catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that third quarter technology segment results will be similar to first quarter results. Now let me summarize the second quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy with Slide 20. LYB's second quarter results reflect higher production volumes and modest seasonal improvements in market conditions. Looking toward the second half of the year, we continue to expect a slight improvement over our first half results with a slow recovery in global markets. LYB's assets in the U.S. and Middle East are well positioned, operating in regions where low costs for energy and feed stocks provide a durable competitive advantage relative to oil-based production. Our team remains disciplined in our capital allocation strategy and delivering high returns to our shareholders. Our balance sheet is in great shape and we are well equipped to succeed as market conditions modestly improve. Our value enhancement program is on track to contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. We are thrilled with the enthusiasm and results from our progress so far and look forward to providing a more substantive update on our VEP next quarter as we dive deeper on how we are stepping up our performance and culture at LYB. At our Capital Markets Day last year, we outlined our long-term strategy. Through leading technologies and market positions, we are executing on this strategy to grow our global footprint and upgrade our core businesses. Our strategy will not only grow LYB but will also reshape our business portfolio to improve profitability and create sustainable competitive advantages. As Kim highlighted earlier, we see North American polyolefin demand improving in 2024, returning to work long-term historical growth rates. As we look ahead, limited capacity additions in North America bodes well for continued improvements in operating rates and associated margins over the coming years. I am proud to lead our high-performing team as we take decisive actions to unlock value, reshape LYB, and position our company for sustainable future success. With that, we're now pleased to take your questions. Hi Steve, thank you very much for your question and warm welcome from my side. On the refinery, we have announced that multiple times and it's again in our prepared remarks that we plan at the latest to run down the refinery at the latest at the end of Q1 2025. In the meantime, our teams are making very good progress with regards, I mean, to a couple of projects that we have alluded to before. One of them is our second investment in MoReTec. The first one, remember, is in the Cologne hub next to our steam crackers in Wesseling. The second one we plan to bring to the Houston refinery. Leverage upon the hydrotreaters we have, modify those hydrotreaters so we can upgrade the plastic oil that is being produced in MoReTec number two. And that plastic oil would then be supplied to our steam crackers through pipelines in, for example, Channelview. So that's one project that is proceeding well. I hope that we will take a first decision, a first milestone decision on that still this year. The second project is around the renewable hydrocarbons. So these are not plastic waste type hydrocarbons, but hydrocarbons eventually produced out of used cooking oil or other wastes. We see also opportunities to leverage upon the equipment we have at the refinery to produce those renewable hydrocarbons as a feedstock in our refinery in Houston. And again, the same principle, those hydrocarbons would then go through our pipelines to Channelview, to the steam crackers, and then based upon that we would crack them and we would polymerize them. So we have then two elements of our Circulen family. One, the advanced recycling part based upon the MoReTec investment, and the other one, the renew part, which is based upon renewable hydrocarbons. So all that is proceeding well, as we had alluded to in the past. Thank you, Matthew, and welcome as well to you. On propylene oxide, if you talk about the new facility, the PO/TBA facility that we have successfully started up last year, I'm very pleased, I mean, to say that we ran close, I mean, to 90% during Q2 in terms of capacity utilization. I think that's based upon my 34 years in the industry. That's a huge success because that's a major investment that we have made to be able to run pretty much close to nameplate capacity of such a facility and such a relatively short period of time of ramping up. So with that, I will also hand over to Aaron to give a little bit more background on the market supply and demand. I do want to add, I mean, just on the big picture, now we've alluded to that in the past as well, one needs to look at the total different capacities to produce propylene oxide, and still in the world, I would say approximately half of the capacities are based upon chlorohydrin technology, which is a technology that is older, has higher CO2 emissions, is more costly. And actually on January 8, 2024, the China National Development and Reform Commission, the so-called NDRC, announced a ban on most of the chlorohydrin-based PO technology by the end of 2025. So we estimate about 25% of China propylene oxide is chlorohydrin technology. So if you see that that is going to be banned, and you look at that compared to the additional investments in propylene oxide that have been taking place in China, it's probably going to, these rationalizations will partially offset, if not fully offset, I mean the new capacity in China. Of course, I'm very pleased, I mean, to say that the total capital return yield of Q2 was 6%. So I think that's very attractive. Michael, you want to add something on the question of Frank? John, welcome as well, and thank you for your question. Of course, technologies are difficult to compare, I mean, to one each other. What I can say on our MoReTec technology, we have a unit which is up and running in our Ferrara plants, where we also have our R&D people in Italy. So that is not an industrial scale plant, but it's not a lab scale either. It's not a small plant. I mean, this is about four stores, I mean, five, I mean, the plant. So we have very good experience, I mean, with that. The scope, I mean, on the MoReTec 1 investment has been finalized, and we're starting to prepare, I mean, on the grounds, on the investments. So that is proceeding well in Westerling, so for our Cologne hub. Our process is, as I said multiple times, is different than practically any other process that you find out there, because it is a catalytic process, leveraging upon our vast experience we have in catalysis. Well, David, welcome and thank you for your question as well. I mean, if you look at the first half of this year, from a group perspective, of course, then Q1 was better than Q4 last year. Now Q2 was better than Q1. Quite impressively, I mean, 29% better than Q1. Another point that I want to make is, if you now exclude the refinery business, which, as we alluded to before in the call, is going to end its operations, it's a different environment in refining than what we have seen last year. So if you compare Q2 results without refining for this year with Q2 results without refining last year, then our results are better than last year. So the core business is improving as we are progressing. Now to your question on the second half of this year, if you look, I mean, what we alluded to in the prepared remarks, we expect that ethane will remain cheap. There are two $0.05 per pound North American polyethylene price increases in the market. Kim said practically all increased capacity in North America has been absorbed through demand growth as well as exports, record exports. We don't see any inventory buildup throughout the value chain. And we're only at the beginning of the hurricane season. So if you look at all these things, then one would expect that we have a very good momentum, and that should support, I mean, also price increases for polyethylene. We will have to see, of course, how much of the two times $0.05 per pound price increases are out there, but at least you see the momentum in the North American market, which should support, I mean, these price increases. Thank you very much, Kevin. Good question. Of course, I mean, it's not a lot that in addition that we can disclose at this point in time, because we continue to keep all the options open, but as you know, we have made the announcement in the market, so by having made the announcement in the market, that allows us to also have discussions with potential other owners for those assets. I need to differentiate a little bit, like you saw on slide number eight. One part is around propylene oxide, so the POSM units that we have in the Maasvlakte, which is a 50-50 joint venture with Covestro. So that is a bit different, of course, than if you compare, I mean, to the cracker/PEPP sites that we have identified within the scope. So, progressing well, I would say, we're not excluding any opportunity that we have at this point in time, and one thing that I can say is, we are very diligent, we're laser focused, and we will not delay the actions that need to be taken. Well, we continue to see that there is momentum being built up. I talked already a bit on PE, so if you look at PE, you see that just the U.S. domestic demand in Q2 was up by 4% versus Q1, which, just to remind everybody, this is the strongest quarter since two years. Exports were up, let's say, around 8%, 9% versus May and June, so they were, these exports, about the second highest, I mean, all time, and I alluded to the price increases that we have in the marketplace. The same is also a bit valid, I mean, on polypropylene, so we, I mean, demand continues to improve, of course we're still waiting for inflation rates to go down, we're still waiting as a consequence for interest rates to go down, so that consumer confidence would go up, especially for durable goods, but in polypropylene, we see that even if consumer confidence remains low, that there is a bit of improvements already in some other areas, like rigid packaging, seat, films. Our order book is also quite full on polyethylene and polypropylene, so we're happy with that as well. The main issue that continues to be is around China. China demand, we have seen slowly going up, we think around 4%, 5% locally, but that is being absorbed with the additional capacity that is coming on stream. Europe continues to be soft, but then there is some encouraging messages, numbers that we see, especially on the southern part of Europe, the southern countries with higher GDP growth, higher demands, and we see that inflation rates continue to slowly go down in Europe as well. So if you look at everything together, we see a slow increase, a continued increase in terms of demand, so if you talk about these capacity utilization percentages, and Michael made some clarifications on that, it's not so much, I mean, for the second half of the year, because we see and we are worried about demand growth, it's mainly because of our own actions that we have, because if you have a scheduled turnaround on our big cracker that we have in Wesseling in Europe, well, of course, I mean, that gives you lesser capacity that you have available. But rest assured, I mean, we continue to see continuous slow, but good momentum, steady momentum in terms of demand creation. Thank you, Hassan. Thank you for your question. I made a couple of remarks. I mean, it was more around propylene oxide. But maybe I hand over since I have Aaron also in the room here, and he's heading the I&D business, as you know, that he can make a couple of additional comments around the PO, the oxyfuels business. Of course, we're very well positioned because we have that new PO TBA plans that is running very well. So if durable good demand starts moving up, then we have the capacity available to fulfill the demands. Thank you, Chris. I mean, before I hand over to Kim, let me elaborate also that we saw -- despite the fact, I mean, that really durable goods is demand is not really yet going up substantially. But domestic demand in the United States for polypropylene was up about 5% versus Q1, which means that this is the strongest quarter in polypropylene that we have seen since Q3 2021. So with that, Kim. And Chris, we also have a spread improvement price increase. I mean, that is on the table in the market for North America for July of three cents per pound on polypropylene. Yes, thank you very much. Excuse me. Thank you again for all of the thoughtful questions. Let me maybe still articulate a couple of key messages of this call. I believe that we are making excellent progress on our strategy to make LYB a much more focused company with a leading advantaged asset portfolio, as well as product mix. And why am I saying that? I mean, first of all, we're making good progress on our goal to add $3 billion in incremental normalized EBITDA by 2027. Secondly, you see that we have clear actions to increase our historical average EBITDA margin from 18% to above 22% percent. Third, our second quarter due to capital return yield at 6% that we have due to an increased dividend and also some share buybacks is, I think, quite state-of-the-art. And fourth, our current cost advantaged operations in feedstock advantaged regions without our refining is already about 60% of LyondellBasell's production volume. And after we have implemented our European strategic assessment, we expect that that will grow to around 70%. So let's say in a couple of years. So, of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on all aspects of our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend. Stay well, stay healthy and stay safe. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide nine. And let me start by discussing our resilient cash generation. Over the past year, LyondellBasell generated $4.4 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team converted EBITDA into cash at an impressive 95% cash conversion rate during the last 12 months. As a result, we were able to return almost $1.8 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. This represents nearly 70% of our $2.6 billion of free cash flow, in line with our long-term target. At the end of the second quarter, our cash balance was $2.9 billion. Let's continue with Slide 10 and review the details of our second quarter capital allocation. As Peter mentioned, we generated an impressive $1.3 billion of cash from operating activities. During the quarter, we returned $513 million through dividends and share repurchases, while funding $484 million of capital investment. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $1.34 per share, continuing our track record of providing a secure, growing, and competitive dividend for our shareholders. Our team is committed to balanced and disciplined capital allocation as part of our long-term strategy. During the quarter, we divested the ethylene oxide and derivatives business for $700 million. Within a few weeks, we invested approximately $500 million to acquire a 35% share of NATPET integrated polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. We finished the second quarter with approximately $7 billion of available liquidity. In July, LYB successfully amended and extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to 2029, while further strengthening our liquidity by increasing the size of the facility by $500 million to $3.75 billion. Let's continue with a brief update on our VEP progress on Slide 11. The Value Enhancement Program is a highly successful and integral component of our long-term strategy. We are confident in our estimate that the VEP will contribute approximately $400 million to EBITDA in 2024. Our team is rapidly delivering value less than two years after first launching this program. To provide more detail on this year's progress, we have broken out contributions by business segment and category. As you might expect, the segment with the largest contribution is also our most profitable segment, O&P Americas, generating about $265 million of incremental value. In 2024, we anticipate approximately $280 million of benefit across the company from improved product mix and increased variable margins. We anticipate about $95 million of benefit from higher volume, driven by improving reliability and increased rates. While the Value Enhancement Program is primarily focused on increased value generation, the program has also identified opportunities to improve our leading fixed cost position. Overall, we estimate that lower fixed costs across our manufacturing and corporate functions will benefit our results by approximately $25 million this year. As Peter mentioned, LYB's VEP program is a new way of working and unlocking value that is becoming embedded as an evergreen process in our culture. Let's turn to Slide 12 and I will provide a brief overview of the results of each of our segments. LYB's business portfolio delivered $1.4 billion of EBITDA during the second quarter, almost 30% higher than the prior quarter. Seasonal summer demand, coupled with higher production from our asset base, led to increased volumes. Margins modestly improved across most of our businesses. In early July, Hurricane Beryl impacted our operations across the U.S. Gulf Coast. LYB proactively shut down some of our assets ahead of the storm. Our prudent approach reduces the potential for damage to our assets and the surrounding community during adverse conditions. As a result, we did not experience any workplace injuries and property damage was not material. Nonetheless, we estimate that storm-related downtime will impact third quarter EBITDA by approximately $65 million, with approximately 75% in our O&P America segment. We have relatively modest levels of maintenance activity planned for the remainder of the year. In the appendix to this slide deck, we provide updated 2024 modeling guidance for planned maintenance impacts and other financial metrics. With a sharp focus on working capital, we continue to align our operating rates to meet market demand. During the third quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our North American olefins and polyolefin assets, 80% for our European olefins and polyolefin assets, and 75% for intermediates and derivative assets. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim. Kim? And hey Steve, it's Michael. I would say that a lot of the hydrogen projects are probably challenged without subsidies. And then before we move on to the next question, I wanted to clarify something. We received a lot of questions around our operating rates this morning from the materials that we had posted online. So let me see if I can clarify a few points for you all. In April, we guided to second quarter operating rates for the segment as 85% for both O&P Americas and O&P EAI, and 80% for intermediates and derivatives. Our rates for the second quarter were largely in line with that guidance. In the business results discussion posted on our website, we disclosed second quarter cracker operating rates were 95% for O&P Americas and 90% for O&P EAI. We operated our crackers in both regions at higher rates during the second quarter to capture favorable economics for olefins. Our polymer plants operated at lower rates to match second quarter market demand for polymers. As Kim and Aaron mentioned, during the third quarter, we will operate the O&P Americas segment at 85%, O&P EAI at 80%, and I&D at 75%. In O&P Americas, we proactively took some downtime during Hurricane Beryl that will reduce rates by about five percentage points for the third quarter. In EAI, we are starting a turnaround on our larger cracker and Wesseling during the third quarter. We expect our crackers in both regions will operate at higher rates than the segment to continue to capture attractive margins for ethylene, propylene, and other co-products. In I&D, we are performing a turnaround on one of our older PO/TBA plants in Bayport, Texas during the third quarter. In addition, we're taking some downtime at our POSM joint venture in the Netherlands to balance the low market demand for propylene oxide and styrene in the region. If you have any further questions on rates, please feel free to reach out to the IR team for further clarification. Next question. Yes. So thanks for the question, Frank. I mean, just a couple of things. I mean, you know that we have a reputation as a company for delivering strong free cash flow and converting EBITDA into cash. In the last 12 months, we generated 4.4 billions, which is 95% conversion, which is well ahead of our 80%. And just kind of thinking about the year itself, as Peter alluded, we grew our dividend. And we did some buybacks as well in the quarter. As we look to the second half, I think buybacks will continue to be in the mix, probably somewhat modestly, so we're still being a little bit cautious. But from a long-term perspective, the 70% guidance of returning free cash flow to our investors is fully, fully in place, and we're fully committed to it. So flattish to Q3, slightly up second half versus first half, and then Chris, that seasonally, the first and fourth quarters tend to be the weakest, with seasonally, the second and third, the strongest, just as a reminder."

            "name": "Kim Foley",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of the olefins and polyolefins America segment. During the second quarter, O&P America's EBITDA was $670 million. Increased LYB production led to higher volumes and margins. We were pleased to see that integrated polyethylene margins were supported by modestly higher ethylene and polyethylene prices, while ethane and natural gas costs remain low. Demand for North American polyolefins is strengthening in 2024, with June year-to-date industry polyethylene sales up by nearly 11% over the first half of 2023. Strong demand pull from both domestic and export markets is absorbing recent capacity expansions in the region. LYB is well positioned as the third largest polyethylene producer in North America, with strong customer relationships built over decades. In the third quarter, we anticipate continued seasonal demand strength. Low feedstock and energy costs are expected to persist, benefiting North American integrated polyolefin margins. Amid a backdrop of relatively high oil prices, the favorable oil-to-gas ratio provides an advantage to North American producers relative to oil-based production in other parts of the world. Despite disruptions from Hurricane Beryl in early July, the U.S. olefins and polyolefins markets remain well supplied. Nonetheless, the U.S. Gulf Coast hurricane season is still young, with potential for additional disruptions over the coming months. During the third quarter, we will remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand, targeting 85% utilization. After a decade of unprecedented growth, North American polyolefins capacity additions have slowed down. Please turn to Slide 14 as you review the changing outlook for our new supply. In the early 2010s, the advent of shale-based oil and gas production triggered a wave of olefins and polyolefins capacity additions to take advantage of the abundant and low-cost NGL feedstocks. With one or sometimes two world-scale plants coming online nearly every year for over the past decade, North American domestic and export markets for polyethylene and polypropylene became well supplied, leading to reduced operating rates and lower margins. Over the next few years, very little new capacity will come online in North America. After two years of tepid growth, polyethylene sales volumes are growing at double-digit rates during the first half of this year. Demand growth in Latin America is increasingly served by North American supply. Polypropylene volumes are also improving, but remain constrained as we await the inevitable rebound in demand for durable goods. With North American demand growth returning to long-term trends and no meaningful local supply on the horizon, tightening supply and demand balances and higher utilization rates bode well for LyondellBasell's core polyolefins business. Please turn to Slide 15 as we review the results of our olefins and polyolefins Europe, Asia, and international segment. In the second quarter, LYB's integrated polyethylene margins expanded with the increased utilization of cost-advantaged feedstocks such as LPGs, resulting in EBITDA of $70 million. Approximately 40% of LYB's European ethylene production came from advantaged feedstocks. Additionally, higher prices for olefins and coproducts supported European cracker margins amidst modest seasonal demand improvement for polymers. Red Sea logistic challenges have largely subsided during the quarter, but significant higher shipping costs constrain European imports, benefiting local producers. Looking ahead, we anticipate steady olefins and polyolefins demand through the summer in Europe. In September, we will begin planned maintenance at one of our German crackers that will continue into the fourth quarter. As a result, we are targeting approximately 80% operating rates for the third quarter. As part of our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses, we completed the acquisition of a 35% share of the Saudi Arabian NATPET joint venture at the end of May. The joint venture currently operates 400,000 tons of integrated polypropylene capacity using local cost-advantaged propane raw materials and LYB's ferrous polypropylene technology. Together with our partner Alujain, we are evaluating opportunities to significantly grow the joint venture by leveraging new feedstock concessions in Saudi Arabia. And as Peter discussed, in May, we also announced the strategic review of some of our European olefins and polyolefins assets. Our team is working diligently to evaluate our options and order position LYB for future success in the region. Now let's turn to Slide 16 and review the results of the refining segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $15 million. Higher production following the first quarter downtime was more than offset by lower mire crack spreads. Margins decreased driven by lower distillate cracks, partially offset by slight improvements in gasoline cracks, with modest second quarter demand indicating a slow start to the driving season. Our hedging program benefited second quarter results. Industry operating rates remained relatively high, leading to ample market supply. In the near term, we expect summer demand to support stable gasoline crack spreads and continued high operating rates for refiners. We intend to operate at approximately 90% of capacity in the third quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets until we shut down, no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. Additional details regarding our ramp down will be provided during our third quarter update. Our team is making good progress in evaluating projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy. With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron. So Peter, I guess what I would add to that is when you when you ask about the overall kind of global dynamics, you've seen a lot of growth in polypropylene, specifically in China, over the last couple years. So what you're seeing play out is more of a regional market, you're, it's much less of an export market than what you see in polyethylene, polypropylene, you know, just to compare and contrast polypropylene, you may export 8% to 10% in the US versus polyethylene, where it would be more like 40% or 50%. So it's a much more regional dynamic. And that dynamic is based on the feedstock to your question around feedstocks. So what is your cost of propylene in different parts of the world, whether you're getting it from refining, whether you're getting it from on purpose PDH units. And then the thing that's really an interesting dynamic in North America, specifically right now is the reliability of that supply of propylene. There's been a lot of PDH capacity that's been brought online, as people have been phasing out propylene coming out of elephant crackers as they've gone to lighter ethane feedstocks. So you see on purpose PDH, having reliability problems, and you're seeing higher, what we would call propylene grade, polypropylene causing the problems. So I hope that answers your question. I apologize. There were some other things going on here in the room. Yes. Your simple answer is yes. There were very good co-product values, especially in butadiene, as well as we felt that that was the best optimization of our European crackers at the time. As we've said in the past, and, you know, we'll just reiterate it because I think it's very important, whether it's in Europe or in the U.S., we are always looking week to week to optimize the feedstock slate of our crackers and produce the best value for LYB. It's not always ethylene. Sometimes it's the co-product."

            "content": "Thank you, Aaron. Please turn to Slide 18 as we review the second quarter results for the advanced polymer solution segment. Second quarter EBITDA was $40 million. Margins increased across most APS businesses as our transformation work and seasonal improvements led to modestly higher pricing. Lower automotive production in Europe led to a slight decrease in volumes. Looking ahead, we expect modest improvement in volumes through the remainder of the year, driven by our strategic initiatives and focus on restoring our growth pipeline. We anticipate headwinds from typical seasonal downtime at automotive OEMs in the third quarter, but our master batch business assured a qualification cycles and offered more opportunities for near-term improvement. Our team is focused on continuously expanding our growth funnel and increasing the win rate with our customers. We're investing in our core team with a growth and value mindset to deliver on our long-term goals for the APS business. With that, I will return the call back to Peter."

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Kinney, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin. \nDavid Kinney: Good day, everybody, and thank you for joining today's call. Before we begin the discussion, I would like to point out that a slide presentation accompanies today's call and is available on our website at www.lyondellbasell.com/investorrelations.\n Today, we will be discussing our business results while making reference to some forward-looking statements and non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, and the alternative measures are useful to investors. \n Nonetheless, the forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainty. We encourage you to learn more about the factors that could lead our actual results to differ by reviewing the cautionary statements in the presentation slides and our regulatory filings, which are also available on our Investor Relations website. \n Comments made on this call will be in regard to our underlying business results using non-GAAP financial measures, such as EBITDA and earnings per share, excluding identified items. Additional documents on our Investor website provide reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures, together with other disclosures, including the earnings release and our business results discussion. \n A recording of this call will be available by telephone beginning at 1:00 p.m. Eastern time today until May 26 by calling (877) 660-6853 in the United States and (201) 612-7415 outside the United States. The access code for both numbers is 13743073. \n Joining today's call will be Peter Vanacker, LyondellBasell's Chief Executive Officer; our CFO, Michael  McMurray; Kim Foley, our Executive Vice President of Global Olefins and Polyolefins and Refining; Aaron Ledet, our EVP of Intermediates and Derivatives; and Torkel Rhenman, our EVP of Advanced Polymer Solutions. \n During today's call, we will focus on first quarter results, current market dynamics, our near-term outlook and our long-term strategy. \n With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. During today's call, our leaders will be discussing results in line with the organizational changes we announced on February 19. In addition to her prior responsibilities for Refining & Supply Chain, Kim Foley is now our Executive Vice President for Global Olefins and Polyolefins. Kim will discuss the results for both O&P segments as well as the refining segments. \n Joining us for the first time on our earnings telephone conference in his new role as Executive Vice President, is Aaron Ledet, who is taking over responsibility from Kim in leading our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Over more than 20 years in the petrochemical industry, with 12 of those years at LYB, Aaron has served in a variety of roles in both Europe and the United States. Most recently, Aaron was responsible for the manufacturing and commercial operations for our O&P Americas segment, where he was also responsible for developing future options for our Houston refinery. Please join me in welcoming Aaron to this call. \n Before we dive into the results, I hope you will invest some time to review this year's addition of our Sustainability Report that we released a few weeks ago. Over the past year, we embedded sustainability into our strategy and made significant progress on our ambitions. This year's Sustainability Report describes how LYB is making everyday sustainability a reality. \n Let's turn to Slide 3 and begin the discussion with our continued leadership in safety performance. There is no greater accomplishment than having every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health as when they began their working day. This is a cornerstone of our successful and sustainable business. LyondellBasell's first quarter incident rate for employees and contractors improved to a rate of only 1 injury per 2 million hours worked. We believe our safety metrics continue to hold a leading position in our industry. And I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance. \n Moving to Slide 4. As we discuss our company's performance during today's teleconference, we hope you will take away 2 main messages. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results while managing challenging market conditions, which have pressured our industry over the past 2 years. In the first quarter, LYB increased its EBITDA modestly over the fourth quarter. Our cash generation was negatively impacted by a build in working capital for good reasons, higher prices and higher volumes. And we see other encouraging signs that the industry is beginning to recover. \n The ratio of oil to gas prices strongly favors LYB's advantage production in North America and the Middle East. Our olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment has returned to profitability. And we're seeing early indications of improvements in the performance of our APS segment. \n The second key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is creating unique opportunities to transform our business. As you have heard me say many times, we are executing on 3 strategic pillars: we're growing and upgrading our core businesses through the startup of our new PO/TBA capacity and the acquisition of our NATPET joint venture in the Middle East. We intend to give a more substantive update on this pillar of our strategy during our second quarter results. \n Now we're stepping up our performance and culture to embrace value creation through our Value Enhancement Program and the transformation of our APS segment. As you might recall, we gave a detailed update on our VEP during last quarter's results. But the most impactful transformation is the progress we have made on our strategic pillar to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. \n The so-called CLCS business will move our feedstocks away from fossil fuels towards an increasing share of recycled and renewable sources. We're building this business through a disciplined, capital-efficient strategy that leverages our existing infrastructure and our competitive advantages, such as leading positions in growing markets and a global network of deep customer relationships.  \n In addition to the first quarter improvements in our underlying businesses, I hope you will come away from this call with an improved understanding of our progress in building CLCS and share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell.  \n Moving to Slide 5. Let's focus on the actions we are taking to build a profitable CLCS business. LYB is targeting capabilities across the circular and low-carbon solutions value chain. We are making a series of strategic investments in plastic waste sourcing, advanced sorting, mechanical recycling and advanced recycling. Slide 5 illustrates how all of these investments fit together to form a comprehensive approach to value creation for LyondellBasell's CLCS business.  \n LyondellBasell's investments in waste sourcing and advanced sorting enable our company to maximize value from a wide variety of recycled and renewable waste streams. Our network will allow LYB to select the highest value proposition for a particular waste feedstock, whether that involves mechanical recycling, advanced recycling or renewables.  \n We continue to use JV structures where appropriate to improve capital efficiency and builds in supply chain resiliency, while growing scale and gaining access to market-leading technologies. \n Construction is underway in Germany at our Cologne integrated hub for our first advanced recycling asset using LYB's proprietary catalyst technology, MoReTec, with a final investment decision expected next year for a second unit in Houston that will likely be twice the size of the German facility. \n We are evaluating options for the potential reuse of the hydro treaters at our Houston refinery to purify recycled and renewable cracker feedstocks. All of these capabilities enable LYB to leverage to substantial investments in our existing cracker and polymerization capacities to process recycled and renewable feedstocks.  \n Finally, in collaboration with converters and brand owners, we bring the recycled and renewable content of these polymers to market through both direct channels and through the custom compounding solutions offered by our APS business. Using mass balancing, the majority of our sales volumes were sold under our well-known Circulen brands.  \n Turning to Slide 6. You can see how the focused execution of our CLCS strategy is resulting in rapid and meaningful growth in sales volumes for LYB's recycled and renewable-based polymers. In 2023, our volumes grew to 123,000 tons, doubling our 2022 sales. And we expect this excellent momentum will continue as we drive towards our 2030 target of at least 2 million tons per year.  \n Last year, at our Capital Markets Day, we outlined our financial targets for LyondellBasell's CLCS business. We continue to expect an incremental EBITDA contribution of $500 million by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030 from this business. By expanding our regional hubs with disciplined acquisitions and organic growth, we are confident we can continue to build and strengthen the leadership position to serve this undersupplied market while generating attractive margins to achieve our financial targets.  \n Let's turn to Slide 7 and summarize our financial results. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results from our well-positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $1.53 per share. EBITDA was $1.1 billion. During the quarter, cash from operating activities consumed about $100 million, and our balance sheet remains robust with $6.5 billion of available liquidity.  \n Let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of the business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. \nMichael McMurray: Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by addressing our cash generation. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.3 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team efficiently converted 93% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $2.3 billion.  \n LYB's investment-grade balance sheet remains strong and enables us to continue to execute on our strategy and grow profitably while increasing returns for our shareholders. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital deployment.  \n During the first quarter, our businesses consumed about $100 million in cash from operating activities. EBITDA improvement was more than offset by a working capital build of just over $600 million. As Peter mentioned, our working capital build was for good reasons, including higher prices and higher volumes, primarily within our O&P-EAI and I&D segments. In O&P-EAI, receivables increased with higher sales volumes as we benefited from the Red Sea logistic disruptions. Our I&D segment had higher receivables due to styrene price increases, and we rebuilt some oxyfuel inventories after fourth quarter maintenance.  \n Our resilient cash generation has resulted in $1.8 billion returned to shareholders over the last 12 months through both dividends and share repurchases.  \n During the quarter, we successfully issued $750 million worth of bonds to refinance our 2024 maturity, which reduced our coupon rate by 25 basis points. Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have $11 billion in long-term debt with an average maturity of about 18 years and a 4% average cost of debt.  \n I would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.1 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Profitability improved quarter-over-quarter in 5 of our 6 segments. In our O&P-Americas segment, the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation benefits sequentially impacted first quarter results. Conversely, our I&D and Refining segments benefited from the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation charges.  \n In our fourth quarter teleconference, we outlined $105 million of first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from planned maintenance in O&P-Americas and Refining. Additional unplanned downtime from winter storm Heather in Houston and other events increased the first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from downtime by approximately $150 million.  \n Our estimate for second quarter planned maintenance EBITDA impact remains at $30 million and is focused on a turnaround of one of the POSM units in Channelview.\n We continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the second quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our global olefins and polyolefins assets and 80% for our intermediates and derivative assets.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim? \nKimberly Foley: Thank you, Michael. After more than 35 years in various leadership positions at LYB, I am very excited to assume responsibility for our O&P segments. Earlier in my career, I was the site manager for our largest site here in Channelview, Texas. It is an honor for me to now lead LyondellBasell's work to grow and upgrade these core businesses for our company.  \n Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment. \u2013First quarter O&P-Americas EBITDA was $521 million. Lower feedstock and energy costs, coupled with stable domestic polyethylene prices, were offset by lower volumes due to planned and unplanned downtime. Olefins margins were supported by higher co-product pricing. As a reminder, fourth quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of $75 million.  \n During the first quarter, the North American polyethylene demand continued to strengthen and, with the support of strong export markets, led to stable domestic prices despite new capacity entering the market. For the North American industry, domestic polyethylene sales volumes improved by more than 5% relative to the fourth quarter. The addition of new capacity to the North American market in 2023 has led to much higher exports from the region.  \n During the first quarter, North American exports of polyethylene were significantly higher than 2023 average. For LYB, our strong domestic share in North America resulted in approximately 30% of our first quarter sales going to the export customers.  \n In the second quarter, we expect feedstock and energy costs will remain relatively low, with LYB targeting higher operating rates following downtime in the first quarter. North American integrated polyolefin producers, including LYB, continue to benefit from a highly advantaged oil to gas ratio, leading to a significantly lower cost relative to oil-derived production.  \n With the remainder of the U.S. polyethylene capacity now online, the market is well supplied, yet demand is keeping the industry inventories relatively balanced at about 40 days of supply. We remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand.  \n As Peter mentioned, we are focused on growing our circular and low-carbon solutions business to build our leadership in the attractive markets of premium recycled and renewable-based polymers. In February, we announced the acquisition of mechanical recycling assets from PreZero and Jurupa Valley, California. These assets extend our recycling footprint into the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area, providing good access to plastic waste feedstock in the region. We believe California offers a favorable backdrop to increase the recovery of plastic waste with better infrastructure, higher recycling rates and supportive policies.  \n Please turn to Slide 12 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins  Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, higher volumes from near-shoring, combined with increased demand from restocking, drove improved results in Europe and Asia, resulting in EBITDA of $14 million. Additionally, throughout the quarter, logistical challenges in the Red Sea proved beneficial for local European producers, resulting in increased volumes and fixed cost recovery. In Europe, variable margins benefited from modest price increases that were mostly offset by higher feedstock costs.  \n As we progress through the second quarter, we expect European Olefins and Polymers results to improve due to firm pricing, lower energy costs and improved seasonal demand. In addition, we continue to monitor the slow and gradual return of Chinese demand.  \n Finally, we are staying true to our commitment to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our acquisition of the Saudi Arabian NATPET joint venture is expected to close in the coming months. The NATPET acquisition is an excellent example of LyondellBasell's strategy to drive long-term growth with advantaged assets.  \n In line with our sustainability goals, we signed another renewable power purchase agreement of 208 megawatts of generation capacity in Germany. With this new agreement, LyondellBasell is rapidly moving towards our 2030 target to supply at least half of our electricity from renewable sources. We now have more than 90% of our 2030 target sourced through agreements for wind and solar electricity capacity.  \n Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results for the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $71 million. Fourth quarter 2023 results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $40 million. Improvement in the gasoline crack spread was partially offset by lower volumes related to planned and unplanned downtime. As previously mentioned, we have implemented a hedging program for a portion of our distillate production to mitigate risk throughout 2024. During the first quarter, distillate cracks outperformed expectations and our results include a mark-to-market losses for the program.  \n In the near term, we expect seasonally stronger demand for gasoline amid rising crude oil prices. We intend to maximize crude throughput at the refinery, and operated approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter.  \n Looking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets. We will continue to target high operating rates until ramp-down begins in the first quarter of 2025. Our team is evaluating several new projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron. \nAaron Ledet: Thank you, Kim, and thank you, Peter, for the kind introduction at the beginning of the call. Like Kim, I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. \n During my career at LyondellBasell, I have served in leadership roles touching on supply chain, APS, Europe, I&D, Refining, and most recently leading O&P in the Americas. I look forward to my new responsibilities to drive value creation and growth across the core businesses within Intermediates & Derivatives at LYB. \n Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. In the first quarter, segment EBITDA was $312 million. As a reminder, the fourth quarter results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $95 million. Our European propylene oxide and derivatives business benefited from logistics disruptions in the Red Sea, leading to near-shoring of local demand that drove higher volumes and margins in the region, a dynamic which has continued into the second quarter. \n In the first quarter, oxyfuels margins declined due to lower premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline. Despite these headwinds, oxyfuels margins remained more than double the level typically seen during the seasonally slow first quarter. Industry outages during the first quarter led to higher styrene margins that have since normalized in April. \n Looking ahead, we anticipate seasonal improvements across all businesses in the segment including benefits from the summer driving season and lower butane costs, providing support for continued strength in oxyfuels margins. \n In line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we have planned maintenance underway at one of our POSM assets in Channelview, Texas. We expect higher volumes across most of our business following unplanned downtime in the first quarter. Our team continues to do a fantastic job in running our new PO/TBA facility with high reliability and utilization while ensuring superb product quality. After considering planned maintenance, we expect to operate at an average rate of about 80% of I&D capacity during the second quarter. \n The process to complete the sale of our ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to INEOS is well underway, and we expect to finalize the transaction in the second quarter. We anticipate a book gain on sale of $275 million, which will be reflected as an identified item during the second quarter. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel. \nTorkel Rhenman: Thank you, Aaron. Let's review the first quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. First quarter EBITDA was $35 million. Volumes increased 12% across our portfolio driven by improving seasonal demand and the lack of typical fourth quarter customers' downtime. \n Variable margins increased due to higher pricing and product mix improvements. This was offset by fixed cost investments during the quarter as we moved forward on our APS transformation. \n In the second quarter, we expect volumes will continue to show modest improvement benefiting from both seasonally higher demand and our growing pipeline of new business. We continue to see good momentum as we expand our growth funnel, with our team highly focused on winning projects with both new and existing customers. Utilizing both our recently acquired metal assets as well as our existing asset base, we are providing customers with innovative and sustainable solutions. We believe that our APS transformation, coupled with market recovery, will deliver results to reach the goals we laid out at our Capital Markets Day last year. \n With that, I will return the call back to Peter. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Torkel. And please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. \n First quarter EBITDA of $118 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst margins. In the second quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will decrease, matching fourth quarter 2023 levels, but will be slightly offset by an increased catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar or perhaps, slightly better than fourth quarter results. \n Please turn to Slide 17 as we discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect to see typical increases in seasonal demand along with some moderate improvements in markets throughout the year. In the Americas, improving export demand for polyethylene is expected to further tighten domestic markets. And additionally, low ethane costs should continue to strengthen integrated polyethylene margins. \n As we move through the year, we expect European markets will begin to see modest improvements. Industrial activity in the region is increasing, and we expect demand will continue to recover as long energy costs gradually improve confidence. The Red Sea logistics disruptions that bolstered first quarter demand continued to influence local purchasing decisions. China markets are exhibiting very slow but steady improvements. We're encouraged by China's targeted stimulus efforts and remain watchful for indications that these measures will deliver meaningful improvements in demand for LYB's products. \n For the packaging sector, demand for nondurables has been consistent. Given that destocking across the packaging value chain seems to be complete, we look forward to the potential for restocking ahead. \n In Building & Construction, we expect to see some benefits from moderating and perhaps falling interest rates and the inevitable recovery in demand for durable goods. In the U.S., stimulus funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will begin to support improving demand for commercial construction with growing benefits expected as the year unfolds. \n In the automotive sector, global production is expected to modestly improve from first quarter levels throughout 2024. Moreover, our APS segment is committed to strategic initiatives focused on winning back customers and growing the business. \n And in oxyfuels and refining, gasoline crack spreads are improving from the lows we saw at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. U.S. vehicle miles traveled have returned to pre-pandemic levels and the value for octane from our oxyfuels is strong. At LYB, we continue to optimize our assets on a global scale by aligning our operating rates to meet market demand and maximize cash generation. \n Now let me summarize the first quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company, with Slide 18. As we move into the summer months, we anticipate seasonal improvements across our businesses in the second quarter. Moving through the year, we expect improvement in the second half driven by stable to lower interest rates and modestly higher demand. LYB's U.S. and Middle East production should continue to benefit from advantaged natural gas-based feedstock and energy costs compared to oil-based peers. Red Sea logistic disruptions were beneficial to our European businesses in the first quarter of 2024 and the time it will take for these tailwinds to fade is uncertain. \n As we mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings call, we are committed to delivering $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 through our Value Enhancement Program. We continue to see enthusiastic support for the program across the company as it becomes an evergreen part of our culture. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the 3 pillars of our long-term strategy. \n Progress continues on growing and upgrading our core businesses. In the coming months, we expect to close on the acquisition of our NATPET propylene and polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. Our divestiture of ethylene oxide and derivatives business to INEOS is expected to occur during the second quarter. \n As we discussed today, LYB continues to build a comprehensive business model to support a profitable Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions business. LyondellBasell is making smart investments to build capabilities across every step of the value chain with a global scale in mind. \n With construction already underway for our first MoReTec advanced recycling assets in Germany, we're building on this momentum with FID for our second larger unit in Houston plants for 2025. Our actions demonstrate LYB's commitment to capture value with Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions. \n Our value enhancement program continues to grow and is a key element of our company culture. Currently, the program is on track to add up to $1 billion of incremental recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025, significantly surpassing our original goals. We're laser focused on our target to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. \n Now with that, we're pleased to take your questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America. \nSteve Byrne: I'm interested in the level of demand that you're hearing from your downstream polyethylene customers for your renewable products, whether [Technical Difficulty] are they willing to sign a long-term contract [Technical Difficulty] in Houston, will you [Technical Difficulty] long-term contracts [Technical Difficulty] and do you expect these to be cost plus given how hydrogen requirements [Technical Difficulty] feedstocks. So just curious whether you think this would be cost plus. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Steve, I mean, thanks for your question. This is Peter. It was a bit difficult, I mean, to understand the line was breaking up. But you were asking for our level of demand on the renewable side of polyethylene as well as if it is cost plus or not. \n Well, we continue to see very good traction in that market. You saw from our presentation that last year we doubled approximately the volumes of our Circulen family, so the mechanical recycles, the advanced recycles and as well the nonplastic waste renewables, so biowaste recycled products. We have -- continue to see very good demand in that regard. We see also that regulation is advancing, particularly in Europe. \n With regards to the contract structures, if we take our first investments in the advanced recycling technology, our MoReTec technology in the Cologne up in Wesseling, then we have a big part of the capacity already contracted. We, on purpose, do not contract the entire capacity because we believe there will be value that we can capture for that part that is not contracted once we start up the facility. \n We are not contracting on a cost-plus basis. I said that multiple times. These markets will have its own supply and demand, and that is actually what we currently are seeing. That means that pricing for renewable, recycled polyethylene, but also polypropylene, has its own price points that is being set in the marketplace. And all that we see is still very much aligned even ahead of what we had said in March last year at the Capital Markets Day. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Cunningham with Citi. \nPatrick Cunningham: So O&P-EAI seems to be seeing some nice benefits from volume trends and firmer prices, particularly in Europe. How do you expect prices to trend into the second quarter and throughout the year? And do you get any sense we may see some reversal in this near shoring and restocking trends that you've highlighted? \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Good question, Patrick. And of course, we are very pleased that we see that the situation is changing in Europe. Of course, as you alluded to and as we said in the prepared remarks, held by discontinuity because of the issues in the Red Sea. \n Generally spoken, and then I will hand over to Kim. Generally spoken, we see that situation not changing very rapidly because the behavior of our customers has changed, that they are buying more locally than eventually relying on cheap imports. So therefore, we expect, as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, I mean, to see further advancement in our profitability in that particular region in the second quarter. Kim, you want to add something to that? \nKimberly Foley: I think the only thing that I would add, Peter, is we continue to see strength in packaging, which you alluded to in our prepared remarks. And none of us can predict what's going to happen with the supply chains, and so long as that threat is out there, I think we'll continue to see more nearshoring. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: And another topic that I want to point out is everybody has noticed that now in Europe, there is consolidation announcements in the market. So if you do the back-of-the-envelope calculation of, in total, now the 3 announcements that have been made, then we're talking about approximately 1.5 million tons of ethylene capacity, that in, let's say, relatively short term should disappear in the market. \n Another point that I want to allude to is that the average age of crackers in Europe is about 45 years, whereby in Europe and the United States it's less than 30 years. There are about 40 crackers in Europe, close to half of them have a capacity that is lower than 500,000 tons per year. So you see that restructuring is actually starting to happen in Europe. And if these announcements are being made, then we would expect also that is being taken into consideration in the value chain, that means our customers and customers of our customers, in where they want to secure their products. \n Having said that, we do not see yet in Europe that there is restocking. So what Kim was alluding to is mainly based upon higher demand because of higher consumption downstream of products being produced. So it's not yet restocking. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Fermium Research. \nFrank Mitsch: And congrats, Kim, on the new role. Why don't we stay with Europe for a minute or two? First off, you indicated that global O&P operates, you expect that 85% in the second quarter. Curious what the split might be Americas versus Europe. But it does seem that the business is catching a break with the Red Sea issues. And to your point, Peter, you also indicated that you were starting to see some rationalizations and so forth. \n You have already taken some actions. Is there more that we should be expecting to happen in Europe? Theoretically, the threat in the Red Sea will be neutralized, and then we'll start to see the global trade flows again, and that will obviously appear to catalyze some actions. So any color there would be very helpful. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Let me take the latter part of your question. Very good question, as usual, Frank. The latter part, I mean around our assets. You rightfully said, we took a very early step when the industry was not undertaking any steps yet, by rationalizing our polypropylene facility to 1 line in the southern part of Italy, in Brindisi. Of course, we've always said that we continue to look at all the different assets that we have in Europe, taking into consideration that we have flexible assets in Europe compared to some other assets that are still there in the industry that are not flexible, that are subscale, that were dealing with high costs, that we have a quite good position with our assets if you look at the cash cost curve in Europe. \n But nevertheless, as we said before, we continue to strategically evaluate our positions in Europe. As I alluded to before, we are quite positive by the dynamics around new regulation that supports the demand for recycled products. And therefore, we've also said, I mean, our Cologne assets were very strategic in that regard. We're building up our Cologne hub around, I mean, renewable polyolefins, around advanced recycling with the MoReTec investments. So that will continue to get a lot of focus as we move forward. \n On the short-term question with the Red Sea, anything that we can add, I mean, Kim? \nKimberly Foley: I think I want to go back to the first part of Frank's question, just so I answer that. As many of you saw in the prepared remarks and the releases this morning, our first quarter North American olefins and polyolefins would operate at our crackers at about 75%. So you asked the question about operating rates for global OPAM. I would say OPAM or global O&P-Americas as well as global, Europe, Asia and International are both at 85% in the second half -- or the second quarter of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Blair with Tudor Pickering Holt. \nMatthew Blair: Could you go into your outlook for PE pricing in the second quarter as well as the back half of the year? Is it fair to say that the export demand right now is stronger than domestic demand for PE? And then also, could you talk a little bit about just overall inventory levels? \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Matthew. Before I hand over to Kim, let me point out that we are, of course, very pleased to see that domestic demand in the United States has improved by 5% versus Q4 last year. Reminding everybody that this is the strongest quarter since Q3 2022. \n In addition to that, as you rightfully said, I mean, the export sales continue to grow, actually breaking records, for the fourth consecutive quarter, which is not so much a surprise if you see at the cost base and if you see the differential between oil and gas. So these are very good dynamics that we see in the marketplace for PE and for producers like ourself with a very low cost basis in the Gulf. Kim? \nKimberly Foley: So Peter, I think what I would add to that, and it's hidden throughout our messaging today, is that domestic demand, as you mentioned, is up, export demand is up. Just to put numbers to your comment around year-on-year. Year-on-year PE exports out of North America are up 27%. So the new capacity that's now online is absolutely being exported around the world. Those channels to market are open. We're involved in all of those. And we're very optimistic now that we have our cracker back up in Corpus Christi, that we're going to be able to fulfill all those channels. \n So yes, as you think about it, we've got a high oil to gas ratio, we've got low energy. The U.S. is set with a very competitive advantage to meet the demands of the world. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: And a couple of points that I also want to outline here, if you look at days on hand and PE, it went down from Q4 to Q1, I mean, from 42 to 40. So you see there as well domestic demand going up, export sales, the topics, I mean, also that Kim highlighted. So we saw also that the capacity utilization [industry] despite, I mean, that we saw a lot of additional capacity being brought online, and we believe that most of that capacity is now producing, maybe a couple of exemptions there with some technical issues, but there is not a lot of major capacities in the United States that still need to come online. So we saw capacity utilization actually moving up to around 90% in PE in the United States. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. \nJeffrey Zekauskas: I have a 2-part question. Is the real break on polyethylene prices, the overcapacity situation in China? And do you think that what the market needs is either a tighter supply/demand balance in China or something moving China prices up in order for prices to really be affected positively in the other jurisdiction? \n The second part is, on Slide 11, under the our actions and talking about olefins and polyolefins America, you say balancing domestic demand with disciplined capacity utilization. What does that exactly mean? \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Let me go I mean to your first question, [ Josh ]. Indeed, as you rightfully pointed out, even if we have seen a little bit of an uptick in demand in China, I would make the case that everybody is bleeding. Margins are not where they need to be. Naphtha is expensive. \n And then the question is how long will that last? Because there may be newer facilities, of course, that can hold on longer, but there is also quite a lot of subscale capacities in China. And I'm sure after, how much, 12, 18 months of bleeding, even 24 months of bleeding, how long will that then last until we will see some actions being undertaken? \n But nevertheless, despite the fact, I mean, the China supply and demand is not where it should be, you see these exports from the United States into other parts of the world reaching breaking records. So the material finds its way then into other markets, markets where maybe also, again, older facilities, not backward integrated, not flexible, fully dependent on naphtha, these are the facilities, of course, that have been very difficult to be competitive. \n As a consequence, we continue to believe -- you've seen, I mean, the price increases at the beginning of the year. You saw the 2 rounds of price increases in the United States last year -- at the end of last year. We have these price increases out in the market, more April and May. And there's a very strong case, if you look at everything that is happening, for those price increases, I mean, to stick. \n If I turn to Kim on the second question. \nKimberly Foley: Second question, I think the easiest way to explain that is it's an optimization. You're going to look at what margin you have on your domestic demand, you're going to look at your incremental cost of production to export, and you're going to make the right optimization across our assets? \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Spector with UBS. \nJoshua Spector: I wanted to ask on the cost side of the equation. So I mean, you continue to make good progress on your Value Enhancement plan. But at the same time, you're investing to stand up a new business in CLCS. I think, correct me if I'm wrong, that's probably a big driver about why your SG&A continues to increase, up about $100 million over the last couple of years. So I'm wondering if you could kind of break the pieces apart in terms of the benefit from VEP you see yourself getting, the costs that you're adding for that new business maybe over the next couple of years that don't have the EBITDA to match that at this point, and maybe inflation, so we can maybe better model over '24 and '25 what the actual drop-through was of the savings versus cost versus new businesses. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Let me go first, and then I hand over to Michael. Of course, I mean, we continue to be very pleased with our VEP program, the acceptance in the organization, the value that we have been able to create last year that we continue to see being created this year. We are very well on track, as I said, to reach or exceed our targets on the VEP for this year. \n I give you an example, I mean, because last year, mid-cycle margin value creation at the end of the year was slightly above $400 million. Bottom line, with effective margins and effective products being sold, for the year was around, I mean, $300 million. Well, a part of that $300 million, that's how the 3 pillars work, have been reinvested in building up the second pillar, and that is the business unit Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions. Not to complete amounts we have invested, but a substantial amount of that $300 million has been reinvested to build up that pillar and as such also more [Technical Difficulty]. \n That, of course, also leads, remember, we have bought out joint venture partners, we have done a number of bolt-on acquisitions. So of course, with that, of course, you get higher SG&A on your balance sheet. But all that is where it works together, I mean, the pillars in our strategy. \nMichael McMurray: Yes, Josh, and maybe just a few more comments in regards to cost. I think we have a pretty good reputation for operating lean, which we think actually gives us an advantage versus others. When times are good, we actually continue to be disciplined. Quite frankly, in 2023, I think underlying cost control was strong. SG&A as a percent of sales totaled 3.8%, despite revenue and cost headwinds. We also made investments in our footprint when we started up PO/TBA in circularity, as you noted, and VEP, and some capability building across the enterprise. And clearly, inflation was a significant headwind last year. \n And as we've moved into 2024, we continue to make some targeted investments, for example, in our CLCS business and our VEP program, where we will invest about $270 million this year. 1/4 of that is OpEx, 3/4 of that is CapEx. \n But again, we're managing well, and driving actions this year both in CapEx and in OpEx. And so I'd say, overall, cost control is strong, and we are making targeted investments, and you can continue to expect us to manage costs well going forward. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: And our portfolio management, of course, helps with that. I mean, as you know, we're almost, I mean, at the point of closing the divestiture of ethylene oxide and derivatives. And we're almost closed at closing our NATPET joint venture, and that triggers then, of course, also soon after that, a final investment decision to expand with an additional line with newer technology. So these things all work together, is what I wanted to highlight. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Hassan Ahmed with Alembic Global. \nHassan Ahmed: Peter, you obviously mentioned a couple of the joint ventures and you recently did, obviously, the NATPET sort of venture out in Saudi Arabia as well. Would love to hear your latest and greatest thoughts about where you guys stand in terms of potentially maybe consolidating the Sasol joint venture. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Hassan. Good question. As you alluded to, I mean, in Saudi Arabia, we have lots of activities ongoing, not just with the existing joint ventures, but then, of course, also with the NATPET joint venture and then the next step with the investment. \n We are happy, and actually, that deal was done before my time, so I'm even super happy, with the fact that we have entered in that joint venture with Sasol. I would say, generally spoken, operation is running well in that joint venture. We're pleased, I mean, with our position that we have in there. And of course, we continue, as we have said multiple times, to always look at opportunities in the marketplace where we can grow and upgrade the core. So we are not focusing now on just one thing, but we are continuing to look at growing and upgrading the core. Having said that, we have multiple times outlined that we will be extremely disciplined in our M&A activities. Michael? \nMichael McMurray: Yes. And maybe, Hassan, I'd say a couple more things. I think clearly, just looking back upon the last 2 years we've been much more active from a portfolio management perspective, both on bringing things in, but also jettisoning things where there are better owners. But I don't think it's appropriate for us as to comment on a specific transaction? \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Vertical Research Partners. \nKevin McCarthy: Peter, last March, or March of '23 I should say, you unveiled some financial goals around your CLCS initiatives, $0.5 billion in EBITDA by 2027 en route to $1 billion in 2030. I was wondering if you could speak to your level of confidence in the March toward the first piece of that in 2027. And part of the reason I ask is, it sounds like you may not take a final investment decision on MoReTec in Houston until next year. I'm not sure exactly how long that might take to build out. But maybe you could kind of speak to the timing and ramp of tonnage extending on what you show on Slide 6. How does that 123 kilotons maybe ramp over the next 2 or 3 years towards your medium- and long-term goals? \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Thank you, Kevin, for your very good question. Generally spoken, we continue to be very confident that we can reach what we have said a bit more than 1 year ago on C&LCS, but also on the overall targets that we had put out there, $0.5 billion on C&LCS 2027, and additional profitability. We are making very good progress, I mean, with the entire family. You saw that one particular slide, I mean, doubling the volumes, very good margins that we are generating for the entire family. \n We, as you know, Kevin, some of the parts go faster than other parts. So it's clear that the renew, CirculenRenew family goes faster because we have been in the market since a couple of years with the biowaste based polyolefins. The network that we have build up and continue to build up on the mechanical recycles, remember all the deals, and it's also on the slide that we did in Europe, and then also starting in the United States, is ramping up very fast as we had planned. \n And the advanced recycling parts, yes, of course, we have the first investment decision taken for the capacity in the Cologne hub. It's on track. Work is on the go, it's underway. The team is on the ground. We look positively on the time line that we have there, I mean, to reach what we had said starting up by the end of 2025. \n And we are now looking at, of course, the concepts, as we have alluded to and is in the slides, to double that capacity, bring, I mean, to Houston at the refinery sites, do the necessary work on the upgrading, looking at that from a technical point of view by leveraging upon our hydrotreaters that we have in the refining. So that one, I would say, you're right. I mean final investment decision not this year, but next year, and then it takes time to build. \n But in the meantime, what we are also doing is we are working up -- as, remember, we always said we will be technology agnostic. So we work together with different partners on the advanced recycling side. So as an off-taker of plastic oil, that we can either upgrade or move directly into our steam crackers. So from that perspective, it gives us the possibility to continue to grow with the advanced recycling polyolefins in the marketplace. So I have no indications that we would not be able to reach our targets. We continue to be very confident. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, our final question this morning comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. \nVincent Andrews: Can I just ask on the cash flow going forward, are we done with the working capital build? Or is there probably a little bit more of that to come in the second quarter? \nMichael McMurray: Vincent, it's Michael. Yes. Well, I'd probably answer the question in 2 ways. I think for the second quarter, it should be relatively stable. But I hope things actually get better in the second half when we consume a bit. But that said, I don't expect us to consume anything that's material? \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Mr. Vanacker for any final comments. \nPeter Z. Vanacker: Yes. Thank you, everybody. Very good questions. But of course, I was missing a little bit questions around our propylene oxide business, our Oxyfuels business, and our APS business. \n Now let me highlight that the team is doing a fantastic work in all of these businesses. We're making very good progress, and we're moving, I mean, to driving season, which, as you know, is always good for oxyfuels, I mean, from an oxyfuels point of view. We continue to see early indications that durable goods demand is going up, which is, of course, also good for our leadership position that we have in low-cost and low-carbon footprint propylene oxides. \n And I'm also very pleased, as I said in the prepared remarks, by seeing how we are on track in the transformation of our APS business. Our win rates, our service level, these are things that we are looking at. And Circulen has seemed or making fantastic progress. So also very pleased with that, despite, of course, certain markets on a global basis, especially in durable goods, not being at the top level yet. So it is very promising when those markets also continue back, I mean, to sustainable growth. \n So thank you all for the thoughtful questions. And of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Peter Z. Vanacker",
            "content": "Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. During today's call, our leaders will be discussing results in line with the organizational changes we announced on February 19. In addition to her prior responsibilities for Refining & Supply Chain, Kim Foley is now our Executive Vice President for Global Olefins and Polyolefins. Kim will discuss the results for both O&P segments as well as the refining segments. \n Joining us for the first time on our earnings telephone conference in his new role as Executive Vice President, is Aaron Ledet, who is taking over responsibility from Kim in leading our Intermediates and Derivatives segment. Over more than 20 years in the petrochemical industry, with 12 of those years at LYB, Aaron has served in a variety of roles in both Europe and the United States. Most recently, Aaron was responsible for the manufacturing and commercial operations for our O&P Americas segment, where he was also responsible for developing future options for our Houston refinery. Please join me in welcoming Aaron to this call. \n Before we dive into the results, I hope you will invest some time to review this year's addition of our Sustainability Report that we released a few weeks ago. Over the past year, we embedded sustainability into our strategy and made significant progress on our ambitions. This year's Sustainability Report describes how LYB is making everyday sustainability a reality. \n Let's turn to Slide 3 and begin the discussion with our continued leadership in safety performance. There is no greater accomplishment than having every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health as when they began their working day. This is a cornerstone of our successful and sustainable business. LyondellBasell's first quarter incident rate for employees and contractors improved to a rate of only 1 injury per 2 million hours worked. We believe our safety metrics continue to hold a leading position in our industry. And I want to congratulate our team for their outstanding safety performance. \n Moving to Slide 4. As we discuss our company's performance during today's teleconference, we hope you will take away 2 main messages. First, LyondellBasell continues to generate resilient results while managing challenging market conditions, which have pressured our industry over the past 2 years. In the first quarter, LYB increased its EBITDA modestly over the fourth quarter. Our cash generation was negatively impacted by a build in working capital for good reasons, higher prices and higher volumes. And we see other encouraging signs that the industry is beginning to recover. \n The ratio of oil to gas prices strongly favors LYB's advantage production in North America and the Middle East. Our olefins and polyolefins, Europe, Asia and International segment has returned to profitability. And we're seeing early indications of improvements in the performance of our APS segment. \n The second key message is that LyondellBasell's focused strategy is creating unique opportunities to transform our business. As you have heard me say many times, we are executing on 3 strategic pillars: we're growing and upgrading our core businesses through the startup of our new PO/TBA capacity and the acquisition of our NATPET joint venture in the Middle East. We intend to give a more substantive update on this pillar of our strategy during our second quarter results. \n Now we're stepping up our performance and culture to embrace value creation through our Value Enhancement Program and the transformation of our APS segment. As you might recall, we gave a detailed update on our VEP during last quarter's results. But the most impactful transformation is the progress we have made on our strategic pillar to build a profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. \n The so-called CLCS business will move our feedstocks away from fossil fuels towards an increasing share of recycled and renewable sources. We're building this business through a disciplined, capital-efficient strategy that leverages our existing infrastructure and our competitive advantages, such as leading positions in growing markets and a global network of deep customer relationships.  \n In addition to the first quarter improvements in our underlying businesses, I hope you will come away from this call with an improved understanding of our progress in building CLCS and share our excitement for the future of LyondellBasell.  \n Moving to Slide 5. Let's focus on the actions we are taking to build a profitable CLCS business. LYB is targeting capabilities across the circular and low-carbon solutions value chain. We are making a series of strategic investments in plastic waste sourcing, advanced sorting, mechanical recycling and advanced recycling. Slide 5 illustrates how all of these investments fit together to form a comprehensive approach to value creation for LyondellBasell's CLCS business.  \n LyondellBasell's investments in waste sourcing and advanced sorting enable our company to maximize value from a wide variety of recycled and renewable waste streams. Our network will allow LYB to select the highest value proposition for a particular waste feedstock, whether that involves mechanical recycling, advanced recycling or renewables.  \n We continue to use JV structures where appropriate to improve capital efficiency and builds in supply chain resiliency, while growing scale and gaining access to market-leading technologies. \n Construction is underway in Germany at our Cologne integrated hub for our first advanced recycling asset using LYB's proprietary catalyst technology, MoReTec, with a final investment decision expected next year for a second unit in Houston that will likely be twice the size of the German facility. \n We are evaluating options for the potential reuse of the hydro treaters at our Houston refinery to purify recycled and renewable cracker feedstocks. All of these capabilities enable LYB to leverage to substantial investments in our existing cracker and polymerization capacities to process recycled and renewable feedstocks.  \n Finally, in collaboration with converters and brand owners, we bring the recycled and renewable content of these polymers to market through both direct channels and through the custom compounding solutions offered by our APS business. Using mass balancing, the majority of our sales volumes were sold under our well-known Circulen brands.  \n Turning to Slide 6. You can see how the focused execution of our CLCS strategy is resulting in rapid and meaningful growth in sales volumes for LYB's recycled and renewable-based polymers. In 2023, our volumes grew to 123,000 tons, doubling our 2022 sales. And we expect this excellent momentum will continue as we drive towards our 2030 target of at least 2 million tons per year.  \n Last year, at our Capital Markets Day, we outlined our financial targets for LyondellBasell's CLCS business. We continue to expect an incremental EBITDA contribution of $500 million by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030 from this business. By expanding our regional hubs with disciplined acquisitions and organic growth, we are confident we can continue to build and strengthen the leadership position to serve this undersupplied market while generating attractive margins to achieve our financial targets.  \n Let's turn to Slide 7 and summarize our financial results. During the first quarter, LyondellBasell's businesses delivered resilient results from our well-positioned and diverse portfolio. Earnings were $1.53 per share. EBITDA was $1.1 billion. During the quarter, cash from operating activities consumed about $100 million, and our balance sheet remains robust with $6.5 billion of available liquidity.  \n Let me turn the call over to Michael first, and then to each of the business leaders who will describe our financial and segment results in more detail. Thank you, Torkel. And please turn to Slide 16, and I will discuss the results for the Technology segment on behalf of Jim Seward. \n First quarter EBITDA of $118 million reflected higher licensing revenue and improved catalyst margins. In the second quarter, we expect that revenue associated with licensing milestones will decrease, matching fourth quarter 2023 levels, but will be slightly offset by an increased catalyst volumes. As a result, we estimate that second quarter Technology segment results will be similar or perhaps, slightly better than fourth quarter results. \n Please turn to Slide 17 as we discuss the near-term market outlook by regions and end markets. As you heard from our business leaders, we expect to see typical increases in seasonal demand along with some moderate improvements in markets throughout the year. In the Americas, improving export demand for polyethylene is expected to further tighten domestic markets. And additionally, low ethane costs should continue to strengthen integrated polyethylene margins. \n As we move through the year, we expect European markets will begin to see modest improvements. Industrial activity in the region is increasing, and we expect demand will continue to recover as long energy costs gradually improve confidence. The Red Sea logistics disruptions that bolstered first quarter demand continued to influence local purchasing decisions. China markets are exhibiting very slow but steady improvements. We're encouraged by China's targeted stimulus efforts and remain watchful for indications that these measures will deliver meaningful improvements in demand for LYB's products. \n For the packaging sector, demand for nondurables has been consistent. Given that destocking across the packaging value chain seems to be complete, we look forward to the potential for restocking ahead. \n In Building & Construction, we expect to see some benefits from moderating and perhaps falling interest rates and the inevitable recovery in demand for durable goods. In the U.S., stimulus funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will begin to support improving demand for commercial construction with growing benefits expected as the year unfolds. \n In the automotive sector, global production is expected to modestly improve from first quarter levels throughout 2024. Moreover, our APS segment is committed to strategic initiatives focused on winning back customers and growing the business. \n And in oxyfuels and refining, gasoline crack spreads are improving from the lows we saw at the end of the fourth quarter of last year. U.S. vehicle miles traveled have returned to pre-pandemic levels and the value for octane from our oxyfuels is strong. At LYB, we continue to optimize our assets on a global scale by aligning our operating rates to meet market demand and maximize cash generation. \n Now let me summarize the first quarter, our outlook and our long-term strategy for the company, with Slide 18. As we move into the summer months, we anticipate seasonal improvements across our businesses in the second quarter. Moving through the year, we expect improvement in the second half driven by stable to lower interest rates and modestly higher demand. LYB's U.S. and Middle East production should continue to benefit from advantaged natural gas-based feedstock and energy costs compared to oil-based peers. Red Sea logistic disruptions were beneficial to our European businesses in the first quarter of 2024 and the time it will take for these tailwinds to fade is uncertain. \n As we mentioned in our fourth quarter earnings call, we are committed to delivering $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 through our Value Enhancement Program. We continue to see enthusiastic support for the program across the company as it becomes an evergreen part of our culture. Our team will continue to remain focused on advancing value creation through the 3 pillars of our long-term strategy. \n Progress continues on growing and upgrading our core businesses. In the coming months, we expect to close on the acquisition of our NATPET propylene and polypropylene joint venture in Saudi Arabia. Our divestiture of ethylene oxide and derivatives business to INEOS is expected to occur during the second quarter. \n As we discussed today, LYB continues to build a comprehensive business model to support a profitable Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions business. LyondellBasell is making smart investments to build capabilities across every step of the value chain with a global scale in mind. \n With construction already underway for our first MoReTec advanced recycling assets in Germany, we're building on this momentum with FID for our second larger unit in Houston plants for 2025. Our actions demonstrate LYB's commitment to capture value with Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions. \n Our value enhancement program continues to grow and is a key element of our company culture. Currently, the program is on track to add up to $1 billion of incremental recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2025, significantly surpassing our original goals. We're laser focused on our target to deliver a more profitable and sustainable growth engine for LyondellBasell. \n Now with that, we're pleased to take your questions. Steve, I mean, thanks for your question. This is Peter. It was a bit difficult, I mean, to understand the line was breaking up. But you were asking for our level of demand on the renewable side of polyethylene as well as if it is cost plus or not. \n Well, we continue to see very good traction in that market. You saw from our presentation that last year we doubled approximately the volumes of our Circulen family, so the mechanical recycles, the advanced recycles and as well the nonplastic waste renewables, so biowaste recycled products. We have -- continue to see very good demand in that regard. We see also that regulation is advancing, particularly in Europe. \n With regards to the contract structures, if we take our first investments in the advanced recycling technology, our MoReTec technology in the Cologne up in Wesseling, then we have a big part of the capacity already contracted. We, on purpose, do not contract the entire capacity because we believe there will be value that we can capture for that part that is not contracted once we start up the facility. \n We are not contracting on a cost-plus basis. I said that multiple times. These markets will have its own supply and demand, and that is actually what we currently are seeing. That means that pricing for renewable, recycled polyethylene, but also polypropylene, has its own price points that is being set in the marketplace. And all that we see is still very much aligned even ahead of what we had said in March last year at the Capital Markets Day. Good question, Patrick. And of course, we are very pleased that we see that the situation is changing in Europe. Of course, as you alluded to and as we said in the prepared remarks, held by discontinuity because of the issues in the Red Sea. \n Generally spoken, and then I will hand over to Kim. Generally spoken, we see that situation not changing very rapidly because the behavior of our customers has changed, that they are buying more locally than eventually relying on cheap imports. So therefore, we expect, as we alluded to in the prepared remarks, I mean, to see further advancement in our profitability in that particular region in the second quarter. Kim, you want to add something to that? And another topic that I want to point out is everybody has noticed that now in Europe, there is consolidation announcements in the market. So if you do the back-of-the-envelope calculation of, in total, now the 3 announcements that have been made, then we're talking about approximately 1.5 million tons of ethylene capacity, that in, let's say, relatively short term should disappear in the market. \n Another point that I want to allude to is that the average age of crackers in Europe is about 45 years, whereby in Europe and the United States it's less than 30 years. There are about 40 crackers in Europe, close to half of them have a capacity that is lower than 500,000 tons per year. So you see that restructuring is actually starting to happen in Europe. And if these announcements are being made, then we would expect also that is being taken into consideration in the value chain, that means our customers and customers of our customers, in where they want to secure their products. \n Having said that, we do not see yet in Europe that there is restocking. So what Kim was alluding to is mainly based upon higher demand because of higher consumption downstream of products being produced. So it's not yet restocking. Let me take the latter part of your question. Very good question, as usual, Frank. The latter part, I mean around our assets. You rightfully said, we took a very early step when the industry was not undertaking any steps yet, by rationalizing our polypropylene facility to 1 line in the southern part of Italy, in Brindisi. Of course, we've always said that we continue to look at all the different assets that we have in Europe, taking into consideration that we have flexible assets in Europe compared to some other assets that are still there in the industry that are not flexible, that are subscale, that were dealing with high costs, that we have a quite good position with our assets if you look at the cash cost curve in Europe. \n But nevertheless, as we said before, we continue to strategically evaluate our positions in Europe. As I alluded to before, we are quite positive by the dynamics around new regulation that supports the demand for recycled products. And therefore, we've also said, I mean, our Cologne assets were very strategic in that regard. We're building up our Cologne hub around, I mean, renewable polyolefins, around advanced recycling with the MoReTec investments. So that will continue to get a lot of focus as we move forward. \n On the short-term question with the Red Sea, anything that we can add, I mean, Kim? Thank you, Matthew. Before I hand over to Kim, let me point out that we are, of course, very pleased to see that domestic demand in the United States has improved by 5% versus Q4 last year. Reminding everybody that this is the strongest quarter since Q3 2022. \n In addition to that, as you rightfully said, I mean, the export sales continue to grow, actually breaking records, for the fourth consecutive quarter, which is not so much a surprise if you see at the cost base and if you see the differential between oil and gas. So these are very good dynamics that we see in the marketplace for PE and for producers like ourself with a very low cost basis in the Gulf. Kim? And a couple of points that I also want to outline here, if you look at days on hand and PE, it went down from Q4 to Q1, I mean, from 42 to 40. So you see there as well domestic demand going up, export sales, the topics, I mean, also that Kim highlighted. So we saw also that the capacity utilization [industry] despite, I mean, that we saw a lot of additional capacity being brought online, and we believe that most of that capacity is now producing, maybe a couple of exemptions there with some technical issues, but there is not a lot of major capacities in the United States that still need to come online. So we saw capacity utilization actually moving up to around 90% in PE in the United States. Let me go I mean to your first question, [ Josh ]. Indeed, as you rightfully pointed out, even if we have seen a little bit of an uptick in demand in China, I would make the case that everybody is bleeding. Margins are not where they need to be. Naphtha is expensive. \n And then the question is how long will that last? Because there may be newer facilities, of course, that can hold on longer, but there is also quite a lot of subscale capacities in China. And I'm sure after, how much, 12, 18 months of bleeding, even 24 months of bleeding, how long will that then last until we will see some actions being undertaken? \n But nevertheless, despite the fact, I mean, the China supply and demand is not where it should be, you see these exports from the United States into other parts of the world reaching breaking records. So the material finds its way then into other markets, markets where maybe also, again, older facilities, not backward integrated, not flexible, fully dependent on naphtha, these are the facilities, of course, that have been very difficult to be competitive. \n As a consequence, we continue to believe -- you've seen, I mean, the price increases at the beginning of the year. You saw the 2 rounds of price increases in the United States last year -- at the end of last year. We have these price increases out in the market, more April and May. And there's a very strong case, if you look at everything that is happening, for those price increases, I mean, to stick. \n If I turn to Kim on the second question. Let me go first, and then I hand over to Michael. Of course, I mean, we continue to be very pleased with our VEP program, the acceptance in the organization, the value that we have been able to create last year that we continue to see being created this year. We are very well on track, as I said, to reach or exceed our targets on the VEP for this year. \n I give you an example, I mean, because last year, mid-cycle margin value creation at the end of the year was slightly above $400 million. Bottom line, with effective margins and effective products being sold, for the year was around, I mean, $300 million. Well, a part of that $300 million, that's how the 3 pillars work, have been reinvested in building up the second pillar, and that is the business unit Circular and Low-Carbon Solutions. Not to complete amounts we have invested, but a substantial amount of that $300 million has been reinvested to build up that pillar and as such also more [Technical Difficulty]. \n That, of course, also leads, remember, we have bought out joint venture partners, we have done a number of bolt-on acquisitions. So of course, with that, of course, you get higher SG&A on your balance sheet. But all that is where it works together, I mean, the pillars in our strategy. And our portfolio management, of course, helps with that. I mean, as you know, we're almost, I mean, at the point of closing the divestiture of ethylene oxide and derivatives. And we're almost closed at closing our NATPET joint venture, and that triggers then, of course, also soon after that, a final investment decision to expand with an additional line with newer technology. So these things all work together, is what I wanted to highlight. Thank you, Hassan. Good question. As you alluded to, I mean, in Saudi Arabia, we have lots of activities ongoing, not just with the existing joint ventures, but then, of course, also with the NATPET joint venture and then the next step with the investment. \n We are happy, and actually, that deal was done before my time, so I'm even super happy, with the fact that we have entered in that joint venture with Sasol. I would say, generally spoken, operation is running well in that joint venture. We're pleased, I mean, with our position that we have in there. And of course, we continue, as we have said multiple times, to always look at opportunities in the marketplace where we can grow and upgrade the core. So we are not focusing now on just one thing, but we are continuing to look at growing and upgrading the core. Having said that, we have multiple times outlined that we will be extremely disciplined in our M&A activities. Michael? Thank you, Kevin, for your very good question. Generally spoken, we continue to be very confident that we can reach what we have said a bit more than 1 year ago on C&LCS, but also on the overall targets that we had put out there, $0.5 billion on C&LCS 2027, and additional profitability. We are making very good progress, I mean, with the entire family. You saw that one particular slide, I mean, doubling the volumes, very good margins that we are generating for the entire family. \n We, as you know, Kevin, some of the parts go faster than other parts. So it's clear that the renew, CirculenRenew family goes faster because we have been in the market since a couple of years with the biowaste based polyolefins. The network that we have build up and continue to build up on the mechanical recycles, remember all the deals, and it's also on the slide that we did in Europe, and then also starting in the United States, is ramping up very fast as we had planned. \n And the advanced recycling parts, yes, of course, we have the first investment decision taken for the capacity in the Cologne hub. It's on track. Work is on the go, it's underway. The team is on the ground. We look positively on the time line that we have there, I mean, to reach what we had said starting up by the end of 2025. \n And we are now looking at, of course, the concepts, as we have alluded to and is in the slides, to double that capacity, bring, I mean, to Houston at the refinery sites, do the necessary work on the upgrading, looking at that from a technical point of view by leveraging upon our hydrotreaters that we have in the refining. So that one, I would say, you're right. I mean final investment decision not this year, but next year, and then it takes time to build. \n But in the meantime, what we are also doing is we are working up -- as, remember, we always said we will be technology agnostic. So we work together with different partners on the advanced recycling side. So as an off-taker of plastic oil, that we can either upgrade or move directly into our steam crackers. So from that perspective, it gives us the possibility to continue to grow with the advanced recycling polyolefins in the marketplace. So I have no indications that we would not be able to reach our targets. We continue to be very confident. Yes. Thank you, everybody. Very good questions. But of course, I was missing a little bit questions around our propylene oxide business, our Oxyfuels business, and our APS business. \n Now let me highlight that the team is doing a fantastic work in all of these businesses. We're making very good progress, and we're moving, I mean, to driving season, which, as you know, is always good for oxyfuels, I mean, from an oxyfuels point of view. We continue to see early indications that durable goods demand is going up, which is, of course, also good for our leadership position that we have in low-cost and low-carbon footprint propylene oxides. \n And I'm also very pleased, as I said in the prepared remarks, by seeing how we are on track in the transformation of our APS business. Our win rates, our service level, these are things that we are looking at. And Circulen has seemed or making fantastic progress. So also very pleased with that, despite, of course, certain markets on a global basis, especially in durable goods, not being at the top level yet. So it is very promising when those markets also continue back, I mean, to sustainable growth. \n So thank you all for the thoughtful questions. And of course, we look forward to sharing updates over the coming months as we continue to make progress on our long-term strategy. We hope you all have a great weekend. Stay well and stay safe. Thank you."

            "name": "Aaron Ledet",
            "content": "Thank you, Kim, and thank you, Peter, for the kind introduction at the beginning of the call. Like Kim, I'm honored to have the opportunity to lead the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. \n During my career at LyondellBasell, I have served in leadership roles touching on supply chain, APS, Europe, I&D, Refining, and most recently leading O&P in the Americas. I look forward to my new responsibilities to drive value creation and growth across the core businesses within Intermediates & Derivatives at LYB. \n Please turn to Slide 14 as we look at the Intermediates & Derivatives segment. In the first quarter, segment EBITDA was $312 million. As a reminder, the fourth quarter results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $95 million. Our European propylene oxide and derivatives business benefited from logistics disruptions in the Red Sea, leading to near-shoring of local demand that drove higher volumes and margins in the region, a dynamic which has continued into the second quarter. \n In the first quarter, oxyfuels margins declined due to lower premiums for oxyfuels relative to gasoline. Despite these headwinds, oxyfuels margins remained more than double the level typically seen during the seasonally slow first quarter. Industry outages during the first quarter led to higher styrene margins that have since normalized in April. \n Looking ahead, we anticipate seasonal improvements across all businesses in the segment including benefits from the summer driving season and lower butane costs, providing support for continued strength in oxyfuels margins. \n In line with our guidance from the beginning of the year, we have planned maintenance underway at one of our POSM assets in Channelview, Texas. We expect higher volumes across most of our business following unplanned downtime in the first quarter. Our team continues to do a fantastic job in running our new PO/TBA facility with high reliability and utilization while ensuring superb product quality. After considering planned maintenance, we expect to operate at an average rate of about 80% of I&D capacity during the second quarter. \n The process to complete the sale of our ethylene oxide derivatives businesses to INEOS is well underway, and we expect to finalize the transaction in the second quarter. We anticipate a book gain on sale of $275 million, which will be reflected as an identified item during the second quarter. \n With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel."

            "name": "Kimberly Foley",
            "content": "Thank you, Michael. After more than 35 years in various leadership positions at LYB, I am very excited to assume responsibility for our O&P segments. Earlier in my career, I was the site manager for our largest site here in Channelview, Texas. It is an honor for me to now lead LyondellBasell's work to grow and upgrade these core businesses for our company.  \n Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 11 with the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins \u2013 Americas segment. \u2013First quarter O&P-Americas EBITDA was $521 million. Lower feedstock and energy costs, coupled with stable domestic polyethylene prices, were offset by lower volumes due to planned and unplanned downtime. Olefins margins were supported by higher co-product pricing. As a reminder, fourth quarter results benefited from LIFO inventory valuation changes of $75 million.  \n During the first quarter, the North American polyethylene demand continued to strengthen and, with the support of strong export markets, led to stable domestic prices despite new capacity entering the market. For the North American industry, domestic polyethylene sales volumes improved by more than 5% relative to the fourth quarter. The addition of new capacity to the North American market in 2023 has led to much higher exports from the region.  \n During the first quarter, North American exports of polyethylene were significantly higher than 2023 average. For LYB, our strong domestic share in North America resulted in approximately 30% of our first quarter sales going to the export customers.  \n In the second quarter, we expect feedstock and energy costs will remain relatively low, with LYB targeting higher operating rates following downtime in the first quarter. North American integrated polyolefin producers, including LYB, continue to benefit from a highly advantaged oil to gas ratio, leading to a significantly lower cost relative to oil-derived production.  \n With the remainder of the U.S. polyethylene capacity now online, the market is well supplied, yet demand is keeping the industry inventories relatively balanced at about 40 days of supply. We remain focused on aligning our operating rates to serve domestic and export market demand.  \n As Peter mentioned, we are focused on growing our circular and low-carbon solutions business to build our leadership in the attractive markets of premium recycled and renewable-based polymers. In February, we announced the acquisition of mechanical recycling assets from PreZero and Jurupa Valley, California. These assets extend our recycling footprint into the Greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area, providing good access to plastic waste feedstock in the region. We believe California offers a favorable backdrop to increase the recovery of plastic waste with better infrastructure, higher recycling rates and supportive policies.  \n Please turn to Slide 12 as we review the performance of our Olefins and Polyolefins  Europe, Asia and International segment. In the first quarter, higher volumes from near-shoring, combined with increased demand from restocking, drove improved results in Europe and Asia, resulting in EBITDA of $14 million. Additionally, throughout the quarter, logistical challenges in the Red Sea proved beneficial for local European producers, resulting in increased volumes and fixed cost recovery. In Europe, variable margins benefited from modest price increases that were mostly offset by higher feedstock costs.  \n As we progress through the second quarter, we expect European Olefins and Polymers results to improve due to firm pricing, lower energy costs and improved seasonal demand. In addition, we continue to monitor the slow and gradual return of Chinese demand.  \n Finally, we are staying true to our commitment to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our acquisition of the Saudi Arabian NATPET joint venture is expected to close in the coming months. The NATPET acquisition is an excellent example of LyondellBasell's strategy to drive long-term growth with advantaged assets.  \n In line with our sustainability goals, we signed another renewable power purchase agreement of 208 megawatts of generation capacity in Germany. With this new agreement, LyondellBasell is rapidly moving towards our 2030 target to supply at least half of our electricity from renewable sources. We now have more than 90% of our 2030 target sourced through agreements for wind and solar electricity capacity.  \n Now let's turn to Slide 13 and discuss the results for the Refining segment. First quarter EBITDA was $71 million. Fourth quarter 2023 results were impacted by LIFO charges of approximately $40 million. Improvement in the gasoline crack spread was partially offset by lower volumes related to planned and unplanned downtime. As previously mentioned, we have implemented a hedging program for a portion of our distillate production to mitigate risk throughout 2024. During the first quarter, distillate cracks outperformed expectations and our results include a mark-to-market losses for the program.  \n In the near term, we expect seasonally stronger demand for gasoline amid rising crude oil prices. We intend to maximize crude throughput at the refinery, and operated approximately 95% of capacity in the second quarter.  \n Looking ahead, we remain committed to the safe and reliable operation of these assets. We will continue to target high operating rates until ramp-down begins in the first quarter of 2025. Our team is evaluating several new projects to transform the site in support of our circular and low-carbon solution growth strategy.  \n With that, I will turn the call over to Aaron. I think the only thing that I would add, Peter, is we continue to see strength in packaging, which you alluded to in our prepared remarks. And none of us can predict what's going to happen with the supply chains, and so long as that threat is out there, I think we'll continue to see more nearshoring. I think I want to go back to the first part of Frank's question, just so I answer that. As many of you saw in the prepared remarks and the releases this morning, our first quarter North American olefins and polyolefins would operate at our crackers at about 75%. So you asked the question about operating rates for global OPAM. I would say OPAM or global O&P-Americas as well as global, Europe, Asia and International are both at 85% in the second half -- or the second quarter of the year. So Peter, I think what I would add to that, and it's hidden throughout our messaging today, is that domestic demand, as you mentioned, is up, export demand is up. Just to put numbers to your comment around year-on-year. Year-on-year PE exports out of North America are up 27%. So the new capacity that's now online is absolutely being exported around the world. Those channels to market are open. We're involved in all of those. And we're very optimistic now that we have our cracker back up in Corpus Christi, that we're going to be able to fulfill all those channels. \n So yes, as you think about it, we've got a high oil to gas ratio, we've got low energy. The U.S. is set with a very competitive advantage to meet the demands of the world. Second question, I think the easiest way to explain that is it's an optimization. You're going to look at what margin you have on your domestic demand, you're going to look at your incremental cost of production to export, and you're going to make the right optimization across our assets?"

            "name": "Michael McMurray",
            "content": "Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8, and let me begin by addressing our cash generation. During the past 4 quarters, LyondellBasell generated $4.3 billion of cash from operating activities. Our team efficiently converted 93% of our EBITDA into cash over the last 12 months. At the end of the quarter, our cash balance was $2.3 billion.  \n LYB's investment-grade balance sheet remains strong and enables us to continue to execute on our strategy and grow profitably while increasing returns for our shareholders. Let's continue with Slide 9 and review the details of our capital deployment.  \n During the first quarter, our businesses consumed about $100 million in cash from operating activities. EBITDA improvement was more than offset by a working capital build of just over $600 million. As Peter mentioned, our working capital build was for good reasons, including higher prices and higher volumes, primarily within our O&P-EAI and I&D segments. In O&P-EAI, receivables increased with higher sales volumes as we benefited from the Red Sea logistic disruptions. Our I&D segment had higher receivables due to styrene price increases, and we rebuilt some oxyfuel inventories after fourth quarter maintenance.  \n Our resilient cash generation has resulted in $1.8 billion returned to shareholders over the last 12 months through both dividends and share repurchases.  \n During the quarter, we successfully issued $750 million worth of bonds to refinance our 2024 maturity, which reduced our coupon rate by 25 basis points. Our balance sheet is in great shape. We have $11 billion in long-term debt with an average maturity of about 18 years and a 4% average cost of debt.  \n I would now like to provide a brief overview of the results from each of our segments on Slide 10. LyondellBasell's business portfolio delivered $1.1 billion of EBITDA during the first quarter. Profitability improved quarter-over-quarter in 5 of our 6 segments. In our O&P-Americas segment, the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation benefits sequentially impacted first quarter results. Conversely, our I&D and Refining segments benefited from the absence of fourth quarter inventory valuation charges.  \n In our fourth quarter teleconference, we outlined $105 million of first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from planned maintenance in O&P-Americas and Refining. Additional unplanned downtime from winter storm Heather in Houston and other events increased the first quarter estimated EBITDA impact from downtime by approximately $150 million.  \n Our estimate for second quarter planned maintenance EBITDA impact remains at $30 million and is focused on a turnaround of one of the POSM units in Channelview.\n We continue to align our operating rates with market demand to optimize working capital. During the second quarter, we expect operating rates of 85% for our global olefins and polyolefins assets and 80% for our intermediates and derivative assets.  \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Kim. Kim? Yes, Josh, and maybe just a few more comments in regards to cost. I think we have a pretty good reputation for operating lean, which we think actually gives us an advantage versus others. When times are good, we actually continue to be disciplined. Quite frankly, in 2023, I think underlying cost control was strong. SG&A as a percent of sales totaled 3.8%, despite revenue and cost headwinds. We also made investments in our footprint when we started up PO/TBA in circularity, as you noted, and VEP, and some capability building across the enterprise. And clearly, inflation was a significant headwind last year. \n And as we've moved into 2024, we continue to make some targeted investments, for example, in our CLCS business and our VEP program, where we will invest about $270 million this year. 1/4 of that is OpEx, 3/4 of that is CapEx. \n But again, we're managing well, and driving actions this year both in CapEx and in OpEx. And so I'd say, overall, cost control is strong, and we are making targeted investments, and you can continue to expect us to manage costs well going forward. Yes. And maybe, Hassan, I'd say a couple more things. I think clearly, just looking back upon the last 2 years we've been much more active from a portfolio management perspective, both on bringing things in, but also jettisoning things where there are better owners. But I don't think it's appropriate for us as to comment on a specific transaction? Vincent, it's Michael. Yes. Well, I'd probably answer the question in 2 ways. I think for the second quarter, it should be relatively stable. But I hope things actually get better in the second half when we consume a bit. But that said, I don't expect us to consume anything that's material?"

            "content": "Thank you, Aaron. Let's review the first quarter results for the Advanced Polymer Solutions segment on Slide 15. First quarter EBITDA was $35 million. Volumes increased 12% across our portfolio driven by improving seasonal demand and the lack of typical fourth quarter customers' downtime. \n Variable margins increased due to higher pricing and product mix improvements. This was offset by fixed cost investments during the quarter as we moved forward on our APS transformation. \n In the second quarter, we expect volumes will continue to show modest improvement benefiting from both seasonally higher demand and our growing pipeline of new business. We continue to see good momentum as we expand our growth funnel, with our team highly focused on winning projects with both new and existing customers. Utilizing both our recently acquired metal assets as well as our existing asset base, we are providing customers with innovative and sustainable solutions. We believe that our APS transformation, coupled with market recovery, will deliver results to reach the goals we laid out at our Capital Markets Day last year. \n With that, I will return the call back to Peter."
