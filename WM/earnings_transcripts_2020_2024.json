At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host Mr. Ed Egl. Sir, the floor is yours.\nEd Egl: Thank you, Lara. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 earnings conference call. With me this morning are Jim Fish, President and Chief Executive Officer; John Morris, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; and Devina Rankin, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. You'll hear prepared comments from each of them today; Jim will cover high level financials and provide a strategic update; John will cover an operating overview; and Devina will cover the details of the financials, including our 2021 outlook. Before we get started, please note that we have filed a Form 8-K this morning that includes the earnings press release and is available on our website at www.wm.com. The Form 8-K, the press release and the schedules of the press release include important information. During the call, you will hear forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations, projections or opinions about future periods. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Some of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in today's press release and our filings with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and subsequent Form 10-Qs. John will discuss our results in the areas of yield and volume, which unless otherwise noted, are more specifically references to Internal Revenue Growth or IRG from yield or volume. During the call, Jim, John and Devina will discuss operating EBITDA, which is income from operations before depreciation and amortization. Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the fourth quarter of 2019. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA and margin and SG&A expenses have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations, including costs incurred in connection with our fourth quarter acquisition of Advanced Disposal Services or ADS. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the company's website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information about our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections. Additionally, reconciliations for our prior six quarters of adjusted operating EBITDA are included in the table to the earnings press releases for those respective quarters and can also be found on our website at www.wm.com.

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us, and I hope everyone is staying safe and well. We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. In many ways our fourth quarter was a continuation of our strong third quarter performance. Once again, despite the impacts from the pandemic, our team delivered strong and consistent operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter that exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019. If you set aside the $38 million of operating EBITDA contribution from ADS and the $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 2020, our legacy WM operating EBITDA grew 4% versus Q4 of 2019. This was our seventh consecutive quarter to generate operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion, showcasing the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, we kept our eye on the ball working together to provide reliable high-quality service to our customers even as we welcomed a substantial number of new customers and team members following the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. As with the third quarter, our fourth quarter operating EBITDA margin was impressively strong at 28.1% when you consider that it included 50 basis points of dilution from ADS. For the full year, 2020 matched our highest annual operating EBITDA margin of 28.4%. And excluding ADS, we set a new record with 2020 operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5%. So in a year where many companies have suffered significant financial impacts from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis, at Waste Management the resilience of our people and our business model delivered full year 2020 results within 1.5% of our record-high 2019 operating EBITDA. As we look to 2021, in addition to the strong continuous improvement measures we're taking in our collection and disposal business, WM is in a perfect position to leverage our focus on ESG and our accelerated investments in technology to benefit all of our constituents, employees, customers, shareholders, communities and the environment. WM made the decision in March to accelerate technology spending and we're more confident than ever that our investments in Customer Service Digitalization or CSD are the right approach to propel us forward in the post-COVID world. We've made considerable progress towards transforming our business model by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes. Our online sales channel is growing at a triple-digit rate. Most importantly, we're receiving positive feedback from our customers. In 2021, the value creation of CSD will step up as we further differentiate our service to our customers, automated -- automate manual processes and drive further efficiencies and reliability in our operations. On the ESG front, WM has emerged as a true leader in sustainability and we're doing so in a manner that will benefit both shareholders and the environment. Possibly like no other year, this year's WM Phoenix Open pointed to our ability to demonstrate our expertise and leverage our brand recognition for sustainability. This was highlighted during our Sustainability Forum panel discussion with two other ESG-focused CEOs, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Doug McMillon of Walmart. Following our discussion, I received a note from Doug saying, thanks for your leadership Jim. His note was flattering personally to me, but it was also an important statement about where WM stands reputationally with large companies like Walmart with regard to sustainability and where we can help them and our other customers to achieve their sustainability goals. As corporations build road maps to address their own climate impacts, WM is well-positioned to assist through an array of service offerings, including recycling and other beneficial uses such as composting and renewable energy generation. Looking at the potential impact on our financials. So far in 2021, commodities are on a strong upward trajectory and many experts believe this to be the start of a long-term trend. And as North America's largest recycler and one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas for landfill gas, WM should benefit disproportionately from that long-term trend. We're able to close the loop by using that renewable gas to power our natural gas fleet, redefine the processing business with our next-gen recycling technology enhancements and our fee-based pricing strategy, make new investments in innovative solutions for low-value commodities and expand our portfolio of renewable natural gas plants, all of which position us perfectly to benefit our shareholders over the next three to five years. In addition to the E in ESG, we're taking the S, our social responsibility very seriously too. Whether it's our long-established focus on inclusion and diversity, our commitment to our employees to enhance benefits and guaranteed hours during COVID or our efforts to help the underserved and unemployed through our work with organizations like UpSpire and Concordance Academy, we believe in these causes and we're very confident in the long-term value add for our shareholders. It's rewarding to see that our focus on ESG as a strategic value creator for our shareholders, as well as being the right thing to do is getting recognition. At the beginning of February we were named to Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies List for the third year in a row, claiming the top spot in our industry category. During the fourth quarter we were named to CDP's prestigious A List for tackling climate change. The global environmental non-profit recognized Waste Management for the fifth consecutive year, for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and help develop the low-carbon economy. We were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for North America and the World. For the third year in a row we are in the title of Sector Leader for Commercial Services & Supplies. Our view is that our strategic approach to ESG will complement our investments in technology and our core business process improvements, as the key ingredients of our future success. Last year, we laid the foundation for lowering our operating cost model and for offering greater choice to how our customers interact with us and we completed the sizable acquisition of ADS. All of this positions us well for growth in 2021. In the year ahead, we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%, as we continue to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and expect volume growth to improve in 2021 as the impact from the pandemic lessens. From an operating cost perspective, we've learned how to operate our business with a lower cost structure and we remain -- we expect to retain that lower cost structure in 2021 and beyond. As a result, we anticipate overall operating EBITDA growth between 10% and 13.5% in 2021. We expect this substantial growth as we realize the value of synergies from continuing to integrate ADS and improve the profitability of its business, all while we increase our investment in CSD. The benefits from these technology investments and the full integration of ADS will provide runway for further margin expansion in the future. In closing, we performed exceptionally well in 2020, despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19 and we're poised for another strong year in 2021. For that, I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results really underscore the strength and resiliency of our business model. Improving volumes, healthy pricing and better recycling performance produced organic revenue growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As expected, legacy Waste Management collection and disposal volumes improved sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of 5.5% in the third quarter to a decline of 2.7% in the fourth. Fourth quarter MSW volume grew 1.2% and C&D volume, excluding hurricane cleanup, grew 1.8%, both strong indicators of continued economic recovery. While the rate of volume recovery did moderate during the quarter, we did not see a backslide when COVID cases increased in the fall. In fact, as we look at volumes in January, we're encouraged to see improvement from the lull in late November and December. Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter and core price was 3.2%. Adjusted for the impact of lower volume, core price would have been 3.8%. In the collection business, we continue to make progress improving the residential line of business. Our residential yield improved 60 basis points to 3.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to the same period in 2019 and was up again sequentially from 3.5% in the third quarter. Residential volumes declined 1.4%, as we shed business that does not meet our return requirements. Overall, our actions to improve the residential line of business in 2020 resulted in $40 million of operating EBITDA benefit and we expect this to carry forward into 2021. In the post-collection business, fourth quarter landfill core price was 3.3% and transfer station core price was 3.1% demonstrating our continued pricing discipline in these key lines of business. Moving to costs. Operating costs were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. There were some noise in the fourth quarter results. Let me walk you through the difference. In the quarter, as expected, the ADS acquisition increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points. Additionally, the timing of government approvals for fuel tax credits, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2019 with two years' worth of credits, resulted in a 150-basis-point headwind to operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Aside from these impacts, operating costs as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points, demonstrating that we are laser-focused on cost control and continue to benefit from a lower cost structure. As an example, commercial yards and industrial halls declined between 5% and 6% during the fourth quarter, yet overtime decreased in the range of 15% to 18% and we see additional opportunities. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve operating costs as a percentage of revenue in the ADS business, as we further integrate operations and work to exceed our planned synergies. Devina will cover our 2021 financial guidance in more detail, but I want to spend a minute on some key components of growth as we look at the year ahead. We are extremely confident in the aspects of our outlook that we can control and we based our guidance on a stabilizing economy, moderate volume growth and disciplined pricing. We expect organic revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5% and overall revenue growth between 10.75% and 11.25% during 2021. We hit the ground running on the ADS integration on October 30 and it's progressing very well. We expect to achieve between $50 million and $60 million in synergies during 2021. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million of annualized synergies already achieved in the fourth quarter, our run rate synergies exiting 2021 is expected to be between $60 million and $75 million. We are extremely confident in achieving these synergies and that we'll be able to capture the remaining synergies in the first half of 2022. About one-third of the 2021 synergies will come from route optimization which will begin early in the second quarter. We estimate that our onetime cost to achieve these synergies will be $50 million in 2021. And as we've mentioned, we plan to adjust the majority of these costs from our results.  As Jim discussed, our recycling and renewal energy businesses are central to our strategy and we're anticipating strong growth from these businesses in the year ahead. We expect continued improvement in recycling from our fee-for-service model, improved operating cost structure at new MRFs and stable demand for recycled materials which together provide a tailwind of between $40 million and $50 million to 2021 operating EBITDA.  We also expect an incremental $10 million of year-over-year contribution from our renewable energy business from the sale of RINs as pricing for those credits has increased over the last several months. Devina will talk more about our plans to invest in these key businesses in 2021.  In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team including our new team members from ADS for their focus in what continues to be difficult and distracting times. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations and I know this will continue in the year ahead.  I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2020 financial results and 2021 financial outlook and further detail. \nDevina Rankin : Thanks, John and good morning. Our 2020 results demonstrate strong execution from our frontline teams across North America serving our customers throughout the pandemic and doing so in an increasingly cost-effective way.  The same focused execution and cost discipline extended to our team members in sales and back-office functions, which delivered strong SG&A results for the year. Excluding $25 million of SG&A for the ADS business, SG&A improved by $56 million in 2020 to 10.2% of revenue, a 10-basis-point improvement over 2019. We achieved these results while accelerating our technology investments and despite the revenue decline from the pandemic.  I'm proud of our team for this cost discipline in a difficult economic environment. Fourth quarter capital spending was $394 million and that included $29 million of capital to support the integration of ADS and about $30 million of capital that we intentionally pulled forward given the strong recovery in our operations during the third and fourth quarters. 2020 capital spending was $1.632 billion. Our team showed tremendous discipline throughout 2020 as we focused on reducing capital spending in a targeted manner given the volume declines from the pandemic.  Waste Management generated free cash flow of $2.656 billion in 2020. Given the significant impact of the ADS transaction on this result, let me provide detail on some of the moving pieces. After-tax proceeds from the divestitures of ADS and Waste Management businesses to GFL were $691 million. These proceeds were partially offset by after-tax transaction and advisory costs to support the acquisition of $117 million.  Normalizing for these two items, 2020 free cash flow was $2.082 billion. This result demonstrates the resilient nature of our business and the strength of capital discipline as we nearly achieved our original 2020 free cash flow guidance of $2.15 billion despite the impact of COVID-19.  Given the strong result at the end of 2020, we were positioned to forgo relief provided by the CARES Act and we elected to pay approximately $120 million of payroll taxes that we had planned to defer. As we repay that amount in 2021 and 2022 as anticipated, 2020 free cash flow excluding the ADS impact I mentioned would have been about $2.2 billion for the year, which is better than we expected at the end of the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $231 million in dividend. For the full year, we returned $1.33 billion to shareholders comprised of $927 million in dividends and $402 million in share repurchases.  In November, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes at an extremely attractive pre-tax weighted average cost of less than 1.5%. This allowed us to repay short-term borrowings used to fund the ADS acquisition at close. 2021 cash interest savings are expected to be more than $90 million.  Fourth quarter total debt-to-EBITDA of 3.19 times and forecasted leverage ratios are both well within the financial covenants of our revolving credit facilities. We are committed to returning to our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times total debt-to-EBITDA during 2021. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns.  Moving to our 2021 outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate 10.75% to 11.25% revenue growth in the year ahead with solid organic growth in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5%. This underpins our 2021 operating EBITDA guidance of $4.75 million and $4.9 million. We expect this strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion.  Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion in 2021. Excluding about $90 million of capital planned to support the ADS integration this expectation is in line with our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target of 9.5% to 10.5% even while we step up our investments in CSD.  As Jim mentioned, we also see potential incremental investment opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, both of which aid in our sustainability efforts and generate strong returns. As we've now seen improved returns in our state-of-the-art MRFs, we are taking plans to deploy the latest technology and additional MRFs in our network and moving those forward.  We're also planning to invest in more renewable energy plants at our landfills. This investment extends our ability to close the loop between our renewable energy plant and our CNG fleet and does so with very strong economic returns for the company. We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that maximizes long-term value and total shareholder returns.  As announced in December, we are pleased to be increasing our planned quarterly dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We expect our dividend payments to be about $975 million in 2021.  Given our focus on the ADS integration, we expect tuck-in acquisitions to be on the lower end of our typical range of $100 million to $200 million. With more than $1 billion remaining from our free cash flow guidance we plan to allocate that to a combination of debt repayment, share repurchases and the high-return sustainability-focused capital investment opportunities I described earlier.  In closing, I want to thank the Waste Management team for their dedication and adaptability to overcome the unique challenges of 2020. We are stronger than we were a year ago and we're looking forward to a better 2021. With that Lara, let's open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey good morning. Thank you. My first question is just on the volume side. What are you guys seeing on commercial service increases today. how that's trending? And then in the 4% to 4.5% organic growth do you -- are you baking in any vaccine impact on volume? And how should we think about that? \nJim Fish: Yes. Good morning, Hamzah. First as far as service increases go, we looked at the fourth quarter as being really good news because it's the first quarter in a while that we've seen net service increases. We were negative of course in Q2 and negative in Q3. And so we turned positive in Q4 and that's very good news as it relates to -- particularly as it relates to small business. And then as we think about volume overall I think what we -- most macroeconomists are saying that the economy recovers as the vaccine rolls out. And so volume is the one that is hardest for us to predict. Normally, it's fairly predictable for us but it's hardest to predict this go-round because we don't know how quickly the vaccine rolls out. But we are starting to see some encouraging signs from states that we talked about previously that were lagging. States like Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania are starting to show some signs of recovery. There are some states like California, New York and then also provinces like I would say Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec that are still way behind. But -- and then of course the states that have been -- that opened first like Texas, like Arizona, Tennessee, Florida those states have been doing actually reasonably well. So our expectation is that those states that are starting to reopen and even the states that haven't started will start to perk up here. And we think that we'll be back to some sense of normalcy on the volume front in the back half of 2021. \nHamzah Mazari: Got it. That's very helpful. And just any comments or thoughts around the new EPA head? And any changes you see regulation-wise that could impact your business from sort of the Biden administration. whether it's PFAS around leachate whether it's renewable tax credits increasing? Historically I think you've been able to pass through environmental regulation costs as a fee, but just any thoughts around that? And is the increased investment in MRFs and landfill to gas is that linked to what you see coming out of the EPA at all, or you would have done this anyway? \nJim Fish: So I'll take the last one first. Not really related to what we're seeing coming out of the EPA. First of all it's very early in this new administration. So those investments are really related to the fact that we believe from an ESG standpoint that they are the right thing to do but we also believe that they provide great shareholder return. So -- and we've -- this is not something that came to us in the last three months. I mean we've been investing in these renewable plants on a -- and doing it diligently over the last probably four -- three to four years. And then of course the recycling business is also related. But we do think that there is a nice uptrend starting and it will continue. And we believe that it's not your normal ebb and flow in terms of commodity prices. It's why I said in my script I think we're disproportionately affected by this in a good way. So your first question really relates to what our expectations are coming out of the new administration. And in an odd sort of way Hamzah we feel like more, I guess greater regulation is actually a good thing for us because we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the baseline regulations. Whether it's from EPA or whether it's from state DEPs we hold ourselves to a higher standard. And so, therefore greater regulation actually ends up being a differentiator for us. And while we don't know exactly what will come out of EPA in the form of regulation around things like PFAS or coal combustion residuals things like that we do look at this as being an opportunity. So we're not displeased with what the future holds for us from that standpoint. \nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Just a clarification question I'll turn it over. Are you guys guiding EPS, or is that sort of not part of guidance anymore? I'm just curious if there's a change in guidance or maybe we missed it. \nJim Fish: We didn't guide EPS and I don't think we did last year either Devina. \nDevina Rankin: No. And the real thing there Hamzah that we're focused on is purchase price allocation impacts to depreciation are difficult to predict. And while we have a really strong view of the purchase price allocation with our 12/31 close, that's something that can get adjusted throughout the next several months. And so the depreciation impacts are something that we'll get better clarity on over the course of the year. But that's one of the things that created noise in EPS and one of the reasons we elected not to guide on that front. \nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Make sense, thank you so much.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. So your next question will come from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nKyle White: Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I hope everyone is doing well. And I think that everyone's family is just safe during this pure weather that's occurring. I wanted to talk about ADS and just kind of see how the integration is going. Anything in particular better or worse than you expected about the assets now that you own them? \nJohn Morris: Kyle no, I think I would tell you 90-plus days in I think we're right on track. I think there's been no real surprises. The things that we've encountered have all been things frankly that we've contemplated. We did have the benefit of a longer timeframe getting ready for it. But I would tell you that, I think we're exactly where we should be in fact probably a little bit ahead. As you heard in my script the one area that will take total Q2 to get going in terms of synergies is on the routing side and that has as much to do with data and system migration as it is anything else. And in addition there's some technology improvements that we're making right now in the ADS fleet to be able to take advantage of all the processes that we have in place to drive efficiency. But I would tell you I'm very, very pleased with where we're at so far. \nKyle White: Got it. And I know it's still ongoing in a very sporadic situation, but do you have a sense of the impact that this extreme weather is causing to your volumes or maybe increased cost of the business? \nJohn Morris: I would tell you certainly in the Houston area right now it's been a rough couple of days and this is not nearly a part of the country that deals with this kind of stuff very well as evidenced by what's happening here. But I think outside of Houston, we don't have a real feel for what is going to -- how significant it's going to be going forward outside of really Texas. \nJim Fish: I wish I had a sense Kyle of what -- of the damage to my house, because I have a little bit of damage at the house so.\nDevina Rankin: It'd be great to know when power and water are coming back.\nKyle White: Well, I hope everyone is safe and I hope it over quickly. Thank you. I'll turn it over.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nJim Fish: Good morning, Tyler.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Devina so thank you for all the guidance. It's very helpful. So as I look at the guidance and I think on my math you're looking for something like 10 to 20 basis points of margin expansion in 2021, if my math is right. My feeling is there's quite a bit moving around in there. Can you just talk about the puts and takes on margins from a year-over-year basis maybe thinking about core expansion maybe how much recycling is going to help and then maybe how dilutive M&A might be?\nDevina Rankin: Certainly. So \u2013 and you are absolutely right, there are puts and takes but we still see good strong margin expansion on that path toward 30% that I know that we consistently talk about. The organic revenue and EBITDA growth of our core solid waste business we see improving 30 to 50 basis points in the year ahead. That is going to be partially offset by some known cost headwinds and then also a very intentional increased technology spend level. The increase in technology spending specifically has about a 30-basis-point impact on the margin measure and about a $50 million impact on EBITDA dollars. In terms of the other puts and takes, I would say recycling from a margin perspective, isn't actually one of the things that's contributing to the margin either expansion or detraction. And that's because for us we have the recycling brokerage business, which tends to offset the margin expansion that we see in the traditional MRF business. So as we see the operations improve on the MRF side, we tend to see a little bit of dilution from growth in our brokerage business which is a very good return on invested capital business for us it dilutes margin. On the renewable energy side, there will be some margin expansion and that was strong in the fourth quarter and something that we are basically including in our 2021 guidance based on how we finished the fourth quarter of 2020. So potentially some upside there, if we see RINs prices continue to escalate from where we ended the fourth quarter. And then with regard to the ADS acquisition, I want to pause on that one for a moment. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 18.5% for the ADS business. That's below their run rate of 24.5% on a WM measurement basis. As a reminder ADS's EBITDA margin included some adjustments for both share-based compensation and accretion that Waste Management doesn't take in its own EBITDA measure. So, on an apples-to-apples basis ADS's margin was 24.5%. And we have strong confidence that, we'll get them up to about 28% in 2021, and then continue the march to WM levels from that point on.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Extremely helpful. Thank you. Real quickly as well from a modeling perspective so I think you mentioned you paid the $120 million in CARES back. I'm just unclear, is that just the half that was due for 2021, or does that repay the burden for both 2021 and 2022?\nDevina Rankin: That repays the burden for 2021 and 2022. So the entire $120 million that we had been deferring over the second and third quarters was repaid in Q4.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Awesome. Thank you. And then John, I know we've talked about resi margins quite a bit in the past. In 2020 did resi margins improve as you refocused there? It sounds like they did. And then secondly, how long do you think it takes to get that business back to either call it a more historical margin level, or maybe a level that you would be more happy with?\nJohn Morris: Well, what I would tell you is, how in my prepared remarks we talked about $40 million of benefit being generated in that line of business in 2020. I would tell you, we still obviously have work to do in 2021. I don't \u2013 we're not going to get there in 2021. And frankly some of the other hills, we're having to climb around COVID and the weights hopefully that's going to moderate in the back half of the year as things, as Jim mentioned, if vaccines get out there and things start to moderate to whatever to normal. In the back half of the year, we're also going to have a better view of what the residential weights are going to look like long term. What I would tell you is not lost in that mix is the fact that our price and yield in residential continues to be strong despite what's going on with CPI, and we've talked about that for the last handful of years. And the other part that's part of that equation is while we talk about the recycling business improving a big piece of the recycling business affects residential. So when you look at those margin improvements, we're overcoming some of those other headwinds that weren't there when we started this initiative so to speak.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you, Tyler.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nKevin Chiang: Great. Thanks for taking my question. And hope everyone is safe as well. Maybe just turning to one of your prepared comments around I guess you're seeing an acceleration in some of the technology initiatives you had. I think you called it a triple-digit rate increase in your online sales channel, for example. If I recall, at your Investor Day, you kind of laid out a bunch of technology initiatives. And I think in aggregate that was going to generate $150 million of savings or kind of earnings opportunities. Just as you stick here today through the pandemic, do you see the ability to achieve that coming sooner? Is the upside potential potentially bigger just given maybe the change in some of your customers behavior through the pandemic?\nJim Fish: Yeah. So to answer that question, at least it's hard to say whether it is a bigger opportunity for us. But because we've chosen to accelerate it, then you would expect that the impact would happen sooner for us. And we're touching really \u2013 I mean, this is a huge transformation for us. I mean, we are literally digitalizing the entire relationship from the very front end which is where we set a customer up all the way through the routing and dispatch, and then collection functions, and all the way through billing and the back end of the process. So it's a massive effort for us, but it don't like it was the right thing to do to accelerate it. And so when we talked about that on an Investor Day, I would tell you that that's \u2013 that it would makes sense that by accelerating the spend we would also accelerate the benefit. I don't know, whether the benefit is necessarily bigger because some of that is dependent on how much differentiation we create. And that is maybe less dependent on us and more dependent on whether competitors choose to do the same thing. But we do believe that having an end-to-end customer experience that's digitalized is something that's almost becoming just the ante to get into the game anymore. It seems as if every company that did well in Q2, when this thing hits, where digitalized in some way shape or form. And so we felt like this was absolutely the right thing to do for our customers. And we do believe that, it gives us an opportunity to grab a bigger slice of the overall pie, particularly those away from competitors that don't choose to make those investments. We know that some competitors already are making those investments or will be. But that piece is maybe a little harder to quantify.\nKevin Chiang: That's helpful. And maybe just turning to your long-term debt or your leverage ratio you're looking to get that back to 2.5 to three times. But I guess if you take a look back, I mean, a lot of your comments around the resilience of the business the -- you outperformed the expectations as you go through a challenging year. Just wondering how you think about your capital structure and if there's an argument that maybe 2.5 to three times might be suboptimal for a company given the resiliency you have in your underlying earnings stream. Just like how do you think about that in the context of what you've gone through in 2020?\nDevina Rankin: I think it's a great question and there is no doubt that producing the free cash flow and EBITDA that Waste Management did in 2020 in the face of a global pandemic is a strong affirmation of the strength and resiliency of this business. And so arguably it certainly could position Waste Management to consider a higher leverage ratio than we had historically. That being said our focus on that long-term range of 2.5 to three times is both considering through-cycle financial position that we look to achieve and also establishing financial flexibility for strategic opportunities. And so we want to be sure that we aren't just positioned to weather a storm so to speak but that we're also positioned to be opportunistic to grow the business over the long term. And that's why we think that 2.5 to three times is the right level for strategic value for value creation for shareholders.\nKevin Chiang: That's great color. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Goldstein from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nJeff Goldstein: Hey, good morning. In your prepared remarks you mentioned commercial yards and industrial hauls declined 5% to 6%, but overtime declined between 15% and 18%. I was just curious what are you doing to drive that delta? And how we should think about the sustainability of that delta in the future?\nJohn Morris: Well, I think Jeff in terms of sustainability when you really look at where we bottomed out in Q2 and then you look at Q3 and Q4, while the volume declines have essentially been cut by more than half we've still been able to keep a proportionate amount of overtime. And it's really just us being really focused on making sure as volumes fluctuate we optimize each day and each week when it comes to the people and the assets. The operating team is doing a really good job of holding on to that as we bottomed out. And then as we've come back we've just been able to maintain that same level of discipline about making sure that we're maximizing each day and each week on an asset basis.\nJeff Goldstein: Okay, got it. And then thinking to the 2021 core price growth guidance of 4%, can you parse out your expectations across commercial, resi, industrial and landfill? Will the price increases being relative lockstep, or are there some areas you expect to see more strength relative to others? Thanks.\nJohn Morris: Well, I think if you look at the trend -- we didn't break it out by line of business. But I think overall if you look at the trend from again where we bottomed out to where we finished the year, the second half of the year Q3 trends into Q4, I think you follow those forward proportionately with each of the lines of business. So one area Jim commented on in his script was really around post-collection pricing both at the landfill and transfer station. We've talked about that quarter-in and quarter-out. We continued even through the pandemic to show strength and resiliency in those two buckets. And I commented on residential and that has been even pre-pandemic a real focal area for us. And while it did moderate a bit in the bottom of the pandemic we've shown progress out of that. So I think we feel comfortable with at least that 4% going into 2021.\nJim Fish: Jeff, the one thing that has been the most challenging for us has been that commercial line of business because it's so impacted by small businesses. And it's also impacted by hospitality. It's impacted by schools in addition to small businesses. It's why we like the industry honestly. As you think about an investment thesis, it's why we like -- we're more of a reopen play this industry is than we might have been in the past. Because we haven't gone through something like this where everything is shut down and in many cases are still shut down. So whether it's WM or whether it's any other waste provider this is a -- this industry is a reopen play and that shows up on the pricing line as well as the volume line. We have some of the price that might be perceived as being somewhat soft in the commercial line of business is really because it's volume-related price. I mean it doesn't feel morally right to use our fee-based approach, which is a new approach for us but it's -- and it's a sophisticated approach. But you can't go and hit small businesses that are sitting across the street from Wrigley Field and who are typically customers that have a burging business during the baseball season and now they have nothing because there's no fans. You can't hit those customers with fees or with price increases. And they understand that and we understand that. They also understand that when their business reopens that we will increase prices as we normally do normal course of business. So there are some volume related price increases that we simply haven't taken and that specifically impacts that commercial line of business. Other lines as John talked about that are doing quite well are landfill and transfer. Residential, obviously, has gotten a lot of focus. So we feel very good about pricing. And there's been absolutely no loss of discipline. That's hard-coded here. It's just that there's -- that we're waiting for some of this volume to return before we feel like it's the proper time to really reapply.\nJeff Goldstein: That was very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nJeff Silber: Thank you so much. In prior quarters you had given us some color on your commercial and industrial clients in terms of service status, what percentage of those customers have come back, what percentage are not coming back. I'm just wondering if we can get an update and what you think we should expect for the rest of the year.\nJohn Morris: Yeah. Jeff, we said we were probably in the high 60s approaching 70% the last time we chat. And I would still tell you we're hovering a little bit better than that right in the 70% range. And as Jim mentioned, the real gap there is just around those businesses have to return. It's really hospitality the reference to Wrigley Field, travel, lodging those kind of things. So I think the good news is that if you look at how well the business performed even without a lot of those small businesses being back online we feel very confident. As those businesses come back, we'll emerge from this even stronger. I would tell you we're -- when you look at our margin performance relative to that as well I think that's also a testament to how well we performed. And as Jim said, -- to Jim's comment, this is a reopening story I think for the industry and specifically for us. We feel very confident about how the business performs as things start to reopen really in the back half of the year.\nJeff Silber: All right. That's great to hear. My follow-up question. You talked earlier about some of the potential regulatory issues from the Biden administration. I want to focus on something a little bit different. There's a proposed federal minimum wage at $15 an hour. I realize you can probably pay more than that. But when we've seen minimum wage increases in some of your territories, some of the states, some of the cities, has that put upward pressure on wages for you? And if so, are you able to pass that through to your customers? Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Yeah. I think it's a great question, and it's one that we've been evaluating. I think the most important element of this for us is that we've been a competitive wage payer as a company for many years. And so, while a minimum wage could certainly effectively raise the tide with regard to where wages are we see that as something that wouldn't disproportionately impact our business and instead is something that we are ahead of in many respects because of where our wages have been historically. It's certainly something that we see the ability to consider if we see that raising -- that rising tide impacts our cost structure, it's something that we would respond to on the price side of the business.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live. Go ahead.\nNoah Kaye: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the questions. Jim, I just want to pick up on what you were saying previously around some of the pricing considerations related to volume coming back. And it's really about sort of how pricing and yield cadence might trend over the course of the year. One might think that just because first half of 2020 yield comps are a little bit easier relative to the second half, and you have the CPI headwind in the back half of the year that you would see better pricing in the front half and ease off in the back half. But it sounds from your comments like there may be just more open-market pricing power you envision later in the year, and so perhaps, pricing will be more ratable. Is that a fair way to think about it, or can you steer me properly? Thanks.\nJim Fish: Yeah. I think that's a fair way to think about it. I mean we have different approaches to different lines of business. So, landfill and transfer honestly, had not gotten the focus that commercial has gotten until probably two years ago. So we've been very focused on landfill and transfer pricing. And so, similarly, we've been very focused recently on residential. And John has talked about that probably for the last four quarters. I think commercial is, as I said, it's -- we've really established a more sophisticated-based approach to commercial pricing, but we do have a significant percentage of those commercial customers that are small businesses. And one that we didn't mention necessarily this morning, but it is schools. I mean schools are I think make up 12% of our commercial business. And in some states -- and I hate to even think about this, but in some states schools haven't returned. So -- and that's grade schools that's high schools and that's universities. That's a big part of our commercial business. It's a part of our industrial business as well. But when it's 12% of your commercial business, it makes a difference. And you're simply not able to price increase customers, who either haven't returned or have returned sparingly. So we think schools are a huge focus at the state level and the federal level and that they -- so the kids need to get back into school and so, I think you'll see the schools reopen fully as we get through the vaccine and we see that at the back half of the year. \nNoah Kaye: Yeah. And I want to talk -- that really sets up a more medium-term to longer-term question around the cycle here. I mean one would look at the typical indicators, very robust housing starts activity, God-willing a full year of reopening in 2022. And then it certainly looks like CPI is going to be higher for 2021 versus 2020. Does it seem right to you that we may have some acceleration of growth in 2022? And how are you aligning the business for that if so?\nJim Fish: Yes that sure seems like a logical conclusion to me. I mean it feels like this economy is ready to really take off like a space shuttle. And so we're seeing some indications of that. Probably our C&D line of business from a volume perspective is the best indicator. That had been down -- way down in Q2, I mean double-digits down. And for the fourth quarter, our C&D volume in Orlando was up 5.5%. So that's starting to tell me -- and that's probably one of the best leading indicators that we have in terms of volume that tells me that things are -- or the pump is primed and it's ready to go.\nNoah Kaye: Yeah. Thanks very much.\nJim Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of David Manthey from Baird. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. Was hoping you could update us on the current levels and your year-end 2021 targets for the percentage of municipal contracts that are linked to a more representative water sewer trash CPI index as well as fee-for-service recycling contracts.\nJohn Morris: So what we've traditionally said is about 40% of our revenue is somehow indexed. I think the better metric to look at is really what we've done on core price and yield within residential over really the last six or seven quarters. I'm looking at Devina to make sure. We've shown progress in each and every quarter including three to four and throughout 2020 and we expect that absolutely to continue in 2021. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we did shed a little bit of business here in 2020. But as I've mentioned in a number of these calls, if it doesn't meet our margin and return criteria we're comfortable doing that. It's not our intent, but we're going to make sure that we deploy our capital to where we get reasonable returns and margins.\nJim Fish: I'm not sure John, of what percentage -- we can get to the percentage for water sewer trash. Suffice to say, it has gone up. In fact we've seen -- I've seen a couple of contracts come across my desk where we are -- where we won the bid and we've increased them off of some of these indices that really weren't representative of our cost structure to water sewer trash. But I don't know John, the exact percentage. We can get you that percentage for you. \nJohn Morris: Yes. And we'll circle back with that number.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. And then, as you work to get the highest cost mile off the road for modeling purposes, is it more relevant to compare overtime trends in 2021 with maybe 2019? And if so, what would -- is like a 5% more or less kind of decrease something that would be reasonable just given the wild swings we saw in overtime in 2020?\nJohn Morris: I don't know if I'd go back to 2019. What I would look at is where we bottomed out in Q2 and what our overtime percentages we're going into that and how we've come out of it. To me that's really been the barometer as this volume declines have really come back more than half in commercial and industrial. As for obvious reasons residential is a little different. But we've been able to outpace the volume increases if you will from an overtime perspective, for us to be down mid-teens and overtime with still 5%, 6%, 7% volume declines is pretty impressive. So I don't know about 2019. David I think the better barometer for us is how we've done in 2020 and how we progressed from the peak of volume decline to where we are now. And I think as I mentioned that's what gives us confidence going into 2021 and then add in the benefit of us getting into the integration of the ADS customers after we migrate the data here in Q2. All those things I think add up to a really positive outlook for us on the OpEx side.\nDavid Manthey: That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nSean Eastman: Hi, Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to dig in on the kind of the free cash flow bridge from 2020 to 2021. I mean again quite a few moving parts. It seems like we should be building off of a $2.2 billion number in 2020 in essence. But Devina maybe if you could just kind of give us a simple kind of rundown of that bridge and those moving parts from a free cash flow perspective that would be great.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So the $2.2 billion that you remark on is a good place for us to start. I think when we think about EBITDA growth always being the biggest contributor there certainly have strong outlook for EBITDA in the year ahead with a 10% to 13.5% increase on a year-over-year basis. In addition to that, we expect the about $90 million benefit from lower cash interest that I mentioned. Cash taxes will increase with those two items going in the opposite direction and we estimate that to be about $125 million to $150 million. There will be a benefit from the fact that the company, paid the transaction cost that is in your $2.2 billion base. So I want to be sure to point that out because the ADS transaction costs are something that we adjusted for and coming to that $2.2 billion. We will have a slight increase in the money spent on the enterprise resource planning that we've discussed. We expect that to go up $15 million on a year-over-year basis. So all in all that's what gets you to your cash from operations increase in the ballpark of $500 million to $600 million. We've got a capital expenditure increase of around $150 million to $250 million. And then proceeds from divestitures we're not forecasting anything significant there have given our traditional range of $50 million to $100 million.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Super helpful. And next one for me is just on RIN. It sounds like this is going to be a growing piece of the business. And it'd be helpful maybe just to get some context for how significant of an earnings driver you foresee this being in maybe five to 10 years. And maybe as of today, is there a rough idea on what the sensitivity in EBITDA is to RIN prices today?\nJim Fish: Yes. Probably all three of us could take a shot at this one. I'll go first and then I'll just pick up the pieces after I pull this up. But I think \u2013 look, I think it depends a little bit on \u2013 to your first question, it depends on how we choose to grow this business. I mean you could make a case that you grow this business outside of our own balance sheet. And so we are \u2013 we have not gone down that path but if you wanted to really kind of blow out this business in a good way and take advantage of what we think is going to be a long-term trend for RINs pricing you could do that or we can grow it within our own business within our own balance sheet. And so we haven't made a decision there. Obviously to date everything has been grown out of our own capital expenditures. So and anything that we're contemplating probably at least for the first half of 2021 would \u2013 and maybe for the entire year would be grown through capital expenditures, as Devina mentioned in her prepared remarks. But we do think that this is a \u2013 as I said there's a long-term uptrend here for commodities. And so that's why I believe it benefits us, disproportionately, regardless of where you look in our earnings stream, whether you look at renewable energy with $2.50 RIN pricing or whether you look at our recycling business, where we're the biggest recycler out there. We feel like this is a more of a three to five year trend. There's a number of reasons for why we see that. I mean here's \u2013 commodities, obviously have been a pretty heavy ebb if you will. And so \u2013 but if we look just at our own business, we see that there is increased demand for cardboard for example, that's driven by what we've discovered in the pandemic that everybody is taking delivery of Amazon boxes at their houses. So we feel like all of these businesses that have commodity price exposure looks to \u2013 they look to have a fairly long uptrend coming. And that's why we are excited about the prospects of whether it's our recycling business or our renewable energy business. And that renewable energy business by the way is made possible by the fact that we have 60% to 70% of our fleet is natural gas. And that also is something that can't be matched in the industry percentage-wise. I hope that helps answer some of that. John?\nJohn Morris: The only thing I would add there with the new administration, I think two things that the new administration will deal with is the RVO, which is a Renewable Volume Obligation and a small refinery exemption, which are two buckets that have really driven RIN pricing in the past, right because there's been a lack of clarity on that. And I think if they stabilize both of those, we're going to see some more stability in RIN pricing, whether it stays at $2.50 or whatever. But I think we'll see more stability and I think that's going to help inform us where we deploy our own capital.\nDevina Rankin: And EBITDA for the renewable energy business was up about $50 million in 2020. What's important to note is that that wasn't all price-related. Some of that was our intentional investment as Jim mentioned that we've been making over the last three to four years. So there was volume and price acceleration in 2020 that provided about $50 million of EBITDA growth. And we see about a $10 million to $15 million improvement in 2021 based on where RINs prices were at the end of 2020.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Got it. Very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Morris: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel. Your line is now live. Go ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you very much and I appreciate you staying on here this long. I want to just touch on the service interval trend assumption in your model. What I think I heard correctly is you did \u2013 you had a favorable improvement in 4Q but you're not assuming it continues to improve favorably. It's stable and therefore that's upside if the housing cycle converts into new business formations.\nDevina Rankin : The way that I would look at that Michael is our volume guide at the macro level for 2021 is about 1.5% volume growth. Clearly a lot of that is built into the second quarter just coming off of the very low base of Q2. We do see some upside in the back half of the year. From a service interval perspective, I wouldn't say that we took that volume guidance to the different parts of -- different lines of business specifically such that I can bifurcate what of that is commercial or industrial. But what we looked at based on how our cost structure responded in 2020, we think that the contribution margin of that volume is around 45% in the year ahead.\nJim Fish: Michael to one of the earlier questions about, does the economy feel like there's a lot of momentum behind it that's ready to really take off? Once we get past this, I think the answer is, yes. We just -- because we don't have a ton of control over that. That's the one that we don't have really much control over, which is volume because of this -- when the pandemic starts to -- the effects that start to lessen. So if your question is about is there conservatism in this volume forecast of 1.5%? I would tell you that the answer is probably more likely, yes than no, but it's -- it is largely dependent on when this reopening comps. But as I said to the earlier question, I absolutely believe that that's a logical conclusion that this economy will be ready to take off once we get past it.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. And yes that's where I was getting to is the history is household formation drives new business formation. We're at $1.5 million and change start $300,000 more than it's been for five years. At some point here the empty storefront gets backfilled.\nJim Fish: That's right. \nMichael Hoffman: You needed a dry cleaner. You need another drugstore or what have you. And that's a box and that's service interval growth. That was the way to think about it.\nJim Fish: Yes. That's right Michael.\nMichael Hoffman : Just to be clear, cadence-wise, based on how you ended the year here it looks like you could actually be flat. It's just barely negative on volume in 1Q and then have a nice pop and then settle into a lower but sustained trend in the second half. Am I thinking about the cadence correctly there?\nJim Fish: Michael, I certainly can do the math and get there. I think we saw lull in late November and December. But the good news as I mentioned earlier is that through the first six-or-so weeks been encouraged by what we've seen on the volume front. Now six weeks does not make a trend. But to your question and relative to Q1 we feel pretty optimistic through the first six weeks anyway in terms of volume.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And Devina if I could try a different tack on a waterfall on two things the EBITDA and the free cash. In the year at four three, I'm rounding you guided to four eight. It looks like Advanced would be about two 60 incremental. And you get recycling John mentioned 45. You mentioned 10 to 15 in RINs. That leaves me like 190 coming from solid waste. Have I thought about that sort of the pieces in the right zone there correctly on the EBITDA to go from four three to four eight? \nDevina Rankin: So we have expectations for the ADS business a little north of what you just projected. We have the $50 million increase in technology that I mentioned earlier that is not part of your bridge. And then we have the known cost headwinds that I mentioned. So you can think of those being specifically related to health and welfare costs risk management costs and incentive compensation. Those are about $100 million in the aggregate. So those are the pieces of the bridge in addition to what you outlined.\nMichael Hoffman : Okay. And then I'm just trying to piece together the question that was asked earlier about the free cash flow one. So it seems like you'd started at $2.082 billion because you paid the CARES Act back. So it's -- that's gone. And you're going to two three. That's $220 million roughly year-over-year net. But the absolute is actually closer to $300 million because you've got about $100-and-some million of cash tax and the like ERP. So I'm really -- I'm looking at a sort of a gross $300 million improvement and then offset by some cash tax issues and ERP. Like is that -- did I get -- did I pull those pieces together about right?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. Yes you did. \nMichael Hoffman: Okay. So last one and I know you and I do this all the time, you wants to find your baseline free cash is $2 billion. And I just want to ask is am I looking through the lens correctly on what I think your own self-help opportunities are that ADS brings in $150 million to $200 million. Eventually working capital has the potential for $150 million to $200 million. IT is another $75 million. So there's a $375 million to $475 million baseline upside. I get it might take a couple of years to get all of that before I even introduced 5% to 6% annual recurring growth in the cash. Am I thinking through this correctly? And if I am all of that self-help, I don't need anything to happen in the macro. That's something you can do. \nDevina Rankin: Yes. The only thing -- so I agree with you 100% that working capital and ADS free cash flow directly to free cash flow. The technology additions that we've mentioned you would have the tax effect. That's the only other item that I would clarify on what you just did, but otherwise I think we're in the same place.\nJim Fish: And then I'm not sure Michael how much of kind of, I mean, your very first question is factored into your math there, which is an economy that grows at a faster pace than the normal economy because of this reemergence. I don't know how much of that's in there but we do believe that's real. We just haven't put it into 2021 yet.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. Well that to me just takes your baseline growth rate of -- if it's five six it turns into a six to eight. That's what I think.\nJim Fish: Yes. Right. Yes.\nMichael Hoffman: And lastly would you talk to us about how inflation influences your business model? I think it's a positive. I'm in the camp that you love inflation and that just helps pricing leverage, but can you talk about that? \nJim Fish: I guess, it's -- I'm not sure I would say, I love inflation, but yes, I get your point. I mean, we are good at passing it through our pricing mechanisms. And so while we -- and look maybe the best example of that has been landfills where we've seen inflation on the cost side of our landfills for probably two years. And as a result, we've started to get quite a bit better on pricing at the landfill and at the transfer station. So we do expect that inflation has been extraordinarily low for quite a long time. I don't know that that lasts for a lifetime. So I think we will see inflation tick back up certainly on the commodity side. And -- but we will do a good job of making sure that gets passed through and then add some margin to it through pricing programs.\nDevina Rankin: And the thing I'd add to that is there's leverage on that as we see better execution with technology to optimize the back-office processes, we've talked about as John and team drive the organization to be more efficient on the road every day. So we've seen tremendous operating and SG&A leverage that helps us to combat inflation. And so those things give us leverage in an inflationary environment as well.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. That offsets your internal cost inflation and then the incremental leverage on inflation to your price spread just drives incremental, margin expansion and free cash flow growth.\nDevina Rankin: Absolutely.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. All right. Thank you very much for taking my questions. And I hope everybody is safe down there [Indiscernible] weather.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, Michael.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is now live. Go ahead please.\nMichael Feniger: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. I appreciate it. Jim just following up on, Hamzah's question around the new EPA and the PFAS question, there's obviously a lot of headlines around super fund sites, and designation of the chemical, and liabilities and lawsuits. Is there any direction or regulation you're specifically looking for or that we should keep an eye out for that would sway things a certain way, or is it just kind of status quo in terms of your investments there and what you guys have been doing for the last few years?\nJim Fish: Yeah. Michael, I think, it's probably -- it's still a little bit early in that game. There's a lot of discussion around PFAS but -- so I'm not sure that -- it's not that we don't have a strategy from a lobbying standpoint. We do have a team in D.C. that is looking at this closely. But I guess the main thing I would say about PFAS is that, while some people are looking at it as a cost we're looking at it as an opportunity for us. I think it goes back to I think to the original premise of your question, which is, if something changes environmentally through EPA as a result of the new administration and part of it might be PFAS, how does that affect us? And we think, it actually has potentially a positive impact and that's why we're looking at it as an opportunity, as opposed to just a cost.\nJohn Morris: And Jim, the one example, I gave is if you think about contaminated soil. That's a place where this PFAS resides, regularly. And we look at our landfills, as being a perfect solution for that, with the right technology on the back end.\nJim Fish: Absolutely right. \nMichael Feniger: Yeah. That was really helpful. That's good color. And Jim, just lastly, just I love to get your big-picture view on M&A. I mean the ADS integration is underway. The approval process was certainly longer than anyone expected. Some of your peers are expecting another sizable year of outsized tuck-ins. Just with so much consolidation underway right now. I'm just wondering if long-term M&A, at Waste Management shifts. Are we shifting to find new markets for you guys to grow into outside of traditional waste with what's kind of played out in the last few years? Thanks.\nJim Fish: I guess that's possible. I mean, I guess, what I can tell you with 100% certainty is we're not doing any more big solid waste acquisitions, because I -- part of the reason that this took as long as it did was COVID-related. Part of it was just the complexity of it. I mean, it was a complex transaction in a space where both companies played a major role. We're number one in the space and ADS was number four. So, there was a lot of complexity. There was a lot of work to be done with DOJ. And so I really don't expect that, at least WM would do another large solid waste acquisition in North America. We'll do tuck-ins. And to Devina's point about, $100 million is where we think we'll come in this year. So I think we can continue to do tuck-ins. And then, as far as our strategy for M&A going out, I think what we've all chosen to do is just really focus right now on the integration of ADS. And once we feel comfortable that that's been well integrated then start to think about what acquisitions look like in the years beyond 2021, 2022.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question will come from the line of Stephanie Yee from JPMorgan. Your line is now live. Go ahead, please.\nStephanie Yee: Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to ask a question about, kind of your longer or medium-term growth algorithm. So, I think at your Investor Day you had laid out that average yield could be about 2%, volume growth being about 2%. And that drives five-some percent of EBITDA growth. I was wondering, if maybe ADS or COVID has changed that algorithm, or if it's too early to tell at this point?\nDevina Rankin: Yeah. I would tell you, it's too early for us to tell at this point. The one thing that we did and we've mentioned, from the time that we laid everything out, at Investor Day was accelerate some of the technology spend. And that acceleration of technology spends is one of the things that has kind of put a little bit of downside pressure on the growth rate, in EBITDA that we had talked about. But we expect that to provide an acceleration of the returns coming as soon as 2022.\nJohn Morris: I would only add Devina is that, when you think about, when and how we bought ADS, they were very similar to us in terms of the volume declines. They were suffering through Q2 and Q3. So as Jim talked about, in the traditional business being a reopening story we think there's obviously some leverage of ADS business, now tucked in reopening and us getting the same lift out of that.\nDevina Rankin: Good point.\nStephanie Yee: Okay, okay. Great. Thanks for that color.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Stephanie.\nOperator: Thank you. And presenters, as I'm not seeing any further questions from the phone line at this time. You can go ahead and continue please.\nJim Fish: Okay. Thanks. And just to wrap-up today, look, there have been so many challenges in this year that we've all faced and that of course includes, -- and thank you by the way for all of your comments, about what's going on in Texas this week. I mean, honestly, for those of us here it felt like Hurricane Harvey part two a little bit. A lot of damage to homes, including my own house and a big, big percentage of the state without power, without water et cetera. Not sure that it needed to be that way honestly, but it was. And so, I guess the positive coming out of it is that it tells me that the human spirit is alive and well. We -- and we at WM or in our personal lives, we take care of each other during these difficult times. And so, thank you to all of our 50,000 teammates, that's -- for all you do each and every day. And thanks to all of you on the call, for joining us this morning. We'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Thank you so much presenters. And again, thank you everyone for participating. This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect. Stay safe. And have a lovely day.",

            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us, and I hope everyone is staying safe and well. We're extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and our full year 2020 results. In many ways our fourth quarter was a continuation of our strong third quarter performance. Once again, despite the impacts from the pandemic, our team delivered strong and consistent operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter that exceeded the fourth quarter of 2019. If you set aside the $38 million of operating EBITDA contribution from ADS and the $60 million fuel tax credit benefit in the fourth quarter of 2019 versus 2020, our legacy WM operating EBITDA grew 4% versus Q4 of 2019. This was our seventh consecutive quarter to generate operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion, showcasing the strength and consistency of our business. In the fourth quarter, we kept our eye on the ball working together to provide reliable high-quality service to our customers even as we welcomed a substantial number of new customers and team members following the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. As with the third quarter, our fourth quarter operating EBITDA margin was impressively strong at 28.1% when you consider that it included 50 basis points of dilution from ADS. For the full year, 2020 matched our highest annual operating EBITDA margin of 28.4%. And excluding ADS, we set a new record with 2020 operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5%. So in a year where many companies have suffered significant financial impacts from the pandemic and resulting economic crisis, at Waste Management the resilience of our people and our business model delivered full year 2020 results within 1.5% of our record-high 2019 operating EBITDA. As we look to 2021, in addition to the strong continuous improvement measures we're taking in our collection and disposal business, WM is in a perfect position to leverage our focus on ESG and our accelerated investments in technology to benefit all of our constituents, employees, customers, shareholders, communities and the environment. WM made the decision in March to accelerate technology spending and we're more confident than ever that our investments in Customer Service Digitalization or CSD are the right approach to propel us forward in the post-COVID world. We've made considerable progress towards transforming our business model by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes. Our online sales channel is growing at a triple-digit rate. Most importantly, we're receiving positive feedback from our customers. In 2021, the value creation of CSD will step up as we further differentiate our service to our customers, automated -- automate manual processes and drive further efficiencies and reliability in our operations. On the ESG front, WM has emerged as a true leader in sustainability and we're doing so in a manner that will benefit both shareholders and the environment. Possibly like no other year, this year's WM Phoenix Open pointed to our ability to demonstrate our expertise and leverage our brand recognition for sustainability. This was highlighted during our Sustainability Forum panel discussion with two other ESG-focused CEOs, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Doug McMillon of Walmart. Following our discussion, I received a note from Doug saying, thanks for your leadership Jim. His note was flattering personally to me, but it was also an important statement about where WM stands reputationally with large companies like Walmart with regard to sustainability and where we can help them and our other customers to achieve their sustainability goals. As corporations build road maps to address their own climate impacts, WM is well-positioned to assist through an array of service offerings, including recycling and other beneficial uses such as composting and renewable energy generation. Looking at the potential impact on our financials. So far in 2021, commodities are on a strong upward trajectory and many experts believe this to be the start of a long-term trend. And as North America's largest recycler and one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas for landfill gas, WM should benefit disproportionately from that long-term trend. We're able to close the loop by using that renewable gas to power our natural gas fleet, redefine the processing business with our next-gen recycling technology enhancements and our fee-based pricing strategy, make new investments in innovative solutions for low-value commodities and expand our portfolio of renewable natural gas plants, all of which position us perfectly to benefit our shareholders over the next three to five years. In addition to the E in ESG, we're taking the S, our social responsibility very seriously too. Whether it's our long-established focus on inclusion and diversity, our commitment to our employees to enhance benefits and guaranteed hours during COVID or our efforts to help the underserved and unemployed through our work with organizations like UpSpire and Concordance Academy, we believe in these causes and we're very confident in the long-term value add for our shareholders. It's rewarding to see that our focus on ESG as a strategic value creator for our shareholders, as well as being the right thing to do is getting recognition. At the beginning of February we were named to Fortune Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies List for the third year in a row, claiming the top spot in our industry category. During the fourth quarter we were named to CDP's prestigious A List for tackling climate change. The global environmental non-profit recognized Waste Management for the fifth consecutive year, for our actions to cut emissions, mitigate climate risks and help develop the low-carbon economy. We were also named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices for North America and the World. For the third year in a row we are in the title of Sector Leader for Commercial Services & Supplies. Our view is that our strategic approach to ESG will complement our investments in technology and our core business process improvements, as the key ingredients of our future success. Last year, we laid the foundation for lowering our operating cost model and for offering greater choice to how our customers interact with us and we completed the sizable acquisition of ADS. All of this positions us well for growth in 2021. In the year ahead, we expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 4% to 4.5%, as we continue to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and expect volume growth to improve in 2021 as the impact from the pandemic lessens. From an operating cost perspective, we've learned how to operate our business with a lower cost structure and we remain -- we expect to retain that lower cost structure in 2021 and beyond. As a result, we anticipate overall operating EBITDA growth between 10% and 13.5% in 2021. We expect this substantial growth as we realize the value of synergies from continuing to integrate ADS and improve the profitability of its business, all while we increase our investment in CSD. The benefits from these technology investments and the full integration of ADS will provide runway for further margin expansion in the future. In closing, we performed exceptionally well in 2020, despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19 and we're poised for another strong year in 2021. For that, I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Yes. Good morning, Hamzah. First as far as service increases go, we looked at the fourth quarter as being really good news because it's the first quarter in a while that we've seen net service increases. We were negative of course in Q2 and negative in Q3. And so we turned positive in Q4 and that's very good news as it relates to -- particularly as it relates to small business. And then as we think about volume overall I think what we -- most macroeconomists are saying that the economy recovers as the vaccine rolls out. And so volume is the one that is hardest for us to predict. Normally, it's fairly predictable for us but it's hardest to predict this go-round because we don't know how quickly the vaccine rolls out. But we are starting to see some encouraging signs from states that we talked about previously that were lagging. States like Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania are starting to show some signs of recovery. There are some states like California, New York and then also provinces like I would say Ontario and Que\u0301bec that are still way behind. But -- and then of course the states that have been -- that opened first like Texas, like Arizona, Tennessee, Florida those states have been doing actually reasonably well. So our expectation is that those states that are starting to reopen and even the states that haven't started will start to perk up here. And we think that we'll be back to some sense of normalcy on the volume front in the back half of 2021. So I'll take the last one first. Not really related to what we're seeing coming out of the EPA. First of all it's very early in this new administration. So those investments are really related to the fact that we believe from an ESG standpoint that they are the right thing to do but we also believe that they provide great shareholder return. So -- and we've -- this is not something that came to us in the last three months. I mean we've been investing in these renewable plants on a -- and doing it diligently over the last probably four -- three to four years. And then of course the recycling business is also related. But we do think that there is a nice uptrend starting and it will continue. And we believe that it's not your normal ebb and flow in terms of commodity prices. It's why I said in my script I think we're disproportionately affected by this in a good way. So your first question really relates to what our expectations are coming out of the new administration. And in an odd sort of way Hamzah we feel like more, I guess greater regulation is actually a good thing for us because we hold ourselves to a higher standard than the baseline regulations. Whether it's from EPA or whether it's from state DEPs we hold ourselves to a higher standard. And so, therefore greater regulation actually ends up being a differentiator for us. And while we don't know exactly what will come out of EPA in the form of regulation around things like PFAS or coal combustion residuals things like that we do look at this as being an opportunity. So we're not displeased with what the future holds for us from that standpoint. We didn't guide EPS and I don't think we did last year either Devina. Thank you. I wish I had a sense Kyle of what -- of the damage to my house, because I have a little bit of damage at the house so. Good morning, Tyler. Yeah. So to answer that question, at least it's hard to say whether it is a bigger opportunity for us. But because we've chosen to accelerate it, then you would expect that the impact would happen sooner for us. And we're touching really \u2013 I mean, this is a huge transformation for us. I mean, we are literally digitalizing the entire relationship from the very front end which is where we set a customer up all the way through the routing and dispatch, and then collection functions, and all the way through billing and the back end of the process. So it's a massive effort for us, but it don't like it was the right thing to do to accelerate it. And so when we talked about that on an Investor Day, I would tell you that that's \u2013 that it would makes sense that by accelerating the spend we would also accelerate the benefit. I don't know, whether the benefit is necessarily bigger because some of that is dependent on how much differentiation we create. And that is maybe less dependent on us and more dependent on whether competitors choose to do the same thing. But we do believe that having an end-to-end customer experience that's digitalized is something that's almost becoming just the ante to get into the game anymore. It seems as if every company that did well in Q2, when this thing hits, where digitalized in some way shape or form. And so we felt like this was absolutely the right thing to do for our customers. And we do believe that, it gives us an opportunity to grab a bigger slice of the overall pie, particularly those away from competitors that don't choose to make those investments. We know that some competitors already are making those investments or will be. But that piece is maybe a little harder to quantify. Jeff, the one thing that has been the most challenging for us has been that commercial line of business because it's so impacted by small businesses. And it's also impacted by hospitality. It's impacted by schools in addition to small businesses. It's why we like the industry honestly. As you think about an investment thesis, it's why we like -- we're more of a reopen play this industry is than we might have been in the past. Because we haven't gone through something like this where everything is shut down and in many cases are still shut down. So whether it's WM or whether it's any other waste provider this is a -- this industry is a reopen play and that shows up on the pricing line as well as the volume line. We have some of the price that might be perceived as being somewhat soft in the commercial line of business is really because it's volume-related price. I mean it doesn't feel morally right to use our fee-based approach, which is a new approach for us but it's -- and it's a sophisticated approach. But you can't go and hit small businesses that are sitting across the street from Wrigley Field and who are typically customers that have a burging business during the baseball season and now they have nothing because there's no fans. You can't hit those customers with fees or with price increases. And they understand that and we understand that. They also understand that when their business reopens that we will increase prices as we normally do normal course of business. So there are some volume related price increases that we simply haven't taken and that specifically impacts that commercial line of business. Other lines as John talked about that are doing quite well are landfill and transfer. Residential, obviously, has gotten a lot of focus. So we feel very good about pricing. And there's been absolutely no loss of discipline. That's hard-coded here. It's just that there's -- that we're waiting for some of this volume to return before we feel like it's the proper time to really reapply. Yeah. I think that's a fair way to think about it. I mean we have different approaches to different lines of business. So, landfill and transfer honestly, had not gotten the focus that commercial has gotten until probably two years ago. So we've been very focused on landfill and transfer pricing. And so, similarly, we've been very focused recently on residential. And John has talked about that probably for the last four quarters. I think commercial is, as I said, it's -- we've really established a more sophisticated-based approach to commercial pricing, but we do have a significant percentage of those commercial customers that are small businesses. And one that we didn't mention necessarily this morning, but it is schools. I mean schools are I think make up 12% of our commercial business. And in some states -- and I hate to even think about this, but in some states schools haven't returned. So -- and that's grade schools that's high schools and that's universities. That's a big part of our commercial business. It's a part of our industrial business as well. But when it's 12% of your commercial business, it makes a difference. And you're simply not able to price increase customers, who either haven't returned or have returned sparingly. So we think schools are a huge focus at the state level and the federal level and that they -- so the kids need to get back into school and so, I think you'll see the schools reopen fully as we get through the vaccine and we see that at the back half of the year. Yes that sure seems like a logical conclusion to me. I mean it feels like this economy is ready to really take off like a space shuttle. And so we're seeing some indications of that. Probably our C&D line of business from a volume perspective is the best indicator. That had been down -- way down in Q2, I mean double-digits down. And for the fourth quarter, our C&D volume in Orlando was up 5.5%. So that's starting to tell me -- and that's probably one of the best leading indicators that we have in terms of volume that tells me that things are -- or the pump is primed and it's ready to go. You bet. I'm not sure John, of what percentage -- we can get to the percentage for water sewer trash. Suffice to say, it has gone up. In fact we've seen -- I've seen a couple of contracts come across my desk where we are -- where we won the bid and we've increased them off of some of these indices that really weren't representative of our cost structure to water sewer trash. But I don't know John, the exact percentage. We can get you that percentage for you. Yes. Probably all three of us could take a shot at this one. I'll go first and then I'll just pick up the pieces after I pull this up. But I think \u2013 look, I think it depends a little bit on \u2013 to your first question, it depends on how we choose to grow this business. I mean you could make a case that you grow this business outside of our own balance sheet. And so we are \u2013 we have not gone down that path but if you wanted to really kind of blow out this business in a good way and take advantage of what we think is going to be a long-term trend for RINs pricing you could do that or we can grow it within our own business within our own balance sheet. And so we haven't made a decision there. Obviously to date everything has been grown out of our own capital expenditures. So and anything that we're contemplating probably at least for the first half of 2021 would \u2013 and maybe for the entire year would be grown through capital expenditures, as Devina mentioned in her prepared remarks. But we do think that this is a \u2013 as I said there's a long-term uptrend here for commodities. And so that's why I believe it benefits us, disproportionately, regardless of where you look in our earnings stream, whether you look at renewable energy with $2.50 RIN pricing or whether you look at our recycling business, where we're the biggest recycler out there. We feel like this is a more of a three to five year trend. There's a number of reasons for why we see that. I mean here's \u2013 commodities, obviously have been a pretty heavy ebb if you will. And so \u2013 but if we look just at our own business, we see that there is increased demand for cardboard for example, that's driven by what we've discovered in the pandemic that everybody is taking delivery of Amazon boxes at their houses. So we feel like all of these businesses that have commodity price exposure looks to \u2013 they look to have a fairly long uptrend coming. And that's why we are excited about the prospects of whether it's our recycling business or our renewable energy business. And that renewable energy business by the way is made possible by the fact that we have 60% to 70% of our fleet is natural gas. And that also is something that can't be matched in the industry percentage-wise. I hope that helps answer some of that. John? Michael to one of the earlier questions about, does the economy feel like there's a lot of momentum behind it that's ready to really take off? Once we get past this, I think the answer is, yes. We just -- because we don't have a ton of control over that. That's the one that we don't have really much control over, which is volume because of this -- when the pandemic starts to -- the effects that start to lessen. So if your question is about is there conservatism in this volume forecast of 1.5%? I would tell you that the answer is probably more likely, yes than no, but it's -- it is largely dependent on when this reopening comps. But as I said to the earlier question, I absolutely believe that that's a logical conclusion that this economy will be ready to take off once we get past it. That's right. Yes. That's right Michael. Michael, I certainly can do the math and get there. I think we saw lull in late November and December. But the good news as I mentioned earlier is that through the first six-or-so weeks been encouraged by what we've seen on the volume front. Now six weeks does not make a trend. But to your question and relative to Q1 we feel pretty optimistic through the first six weeks anyway in terms of volume. And then I'm not sure Michael how much of kind of, I mean, your very first question is factored into your math there, which is an economy that grows at a faster pace than the normal economy because of this reemergence. I don't know how much of that's in there but we do believe that's real. We just haven't put it into 2021 yet. Yes. Right. Yes. I guess, it's -- I'm not sure I would say, I love inflation, but yes, I get your point. I mean, we are good at passing it through our pricing mechanisms. And so while we -- and look maybe the best example of that has been landfills where we've seen inflation on the cost side of our landfills for probably two years. And as a result, we've started to get quite a bit better on pricing at the landfill and at the transfer station. So we do expect that inflation has been extraordinarily low for quite a long time. I don't know that that lasts for a lifetime. So I think we will see inflation tick back up certainly on the commodity side. And -- but we will do a good job of making sure that gets passed through and then add some margin to it through pricing programs. Yeah. Michael, I think, it's probably -- it's still a little bit early in that game. There's a lot of discussion around PFAS but -- so I'm not sure that -- it's not that we don't have a strategy from a lobbying standpoint. We do have a team in D.C. that is looking at this closely. But I guess the main thing I would say about PFAS is that, while some people are looking at it as a cost we're looking at it as an opportunity for us. I think it goes back to I think to the original premise of your question, which is, if something changes environmentally through EPA as a result of the new administration and part of it might be PFAS, how does that affect us? And we think, it actually has potentially a positive impact and that's why we're looking at it as an opportunity, as opposed to just a cost. Absolutely right. I guess that's possible. I mean, I guess, what I can tell you with 100% certainty is we're not doing any more big solid waste acquisitions, because I -- part of the reason that this took as long as it did was COVID-related. Part of it was just the complexity of it. I mean, it was a complex transaction in a space where both companies played a major role. We're number one in the space and ADS was number four. So, there was a lot of complexity. There was a lot of work to be done with DOJ. And so I really don't expect that, at least WM would do another large solid waste acquisition in North America. We'll do tuck-ins. And to Devina's point about, $100 million is where we think we'll come in this year. So I think we can continue to do tuck-ins. And then, as far as our strategy for M&A going out, I think what we've all chosen to do is just really focus right now on the integration of ADS. And once we feel comfortable that that's been well integrated then start to think about what acquisitions look like in the years beyond 2021, 2022. Okay. Thanks. And just to wrap-up today, look, there have been so many challenges in this year that we've all faced and that of course includes, -- and thank you by the way for all of your comments, about what's going on in Texas this week. I mean, honestly, for those of us here it felt like Hurricane Harvey part two a little bit. A lot of damage to homes, including my own house and a big, big percentage of the state without power, without water et cetera. Not sure that it needed to be that way honestly, but it was. And so, I guess the positive coming out of it is that it tells me that the human spirit is alive and well. We -- and we at WM or in our personal lives, we take care of each other during these difficult times. And so, thank you to all of our 50,000 teammates, that's -- for all you do each and every day. And thanks to all of you on the call, for joining us this morning. We'll talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning. Our 2020 results demonstrate strong execution from our frontline teams across North America serving our customers throughout the pandemic and doing so in an increasingly cost-effective way.  The same focused execution and cost discipline extended to our team members in sales and back-office functions, which delivered strong SG&A results for the year. Excluding $25 million of SG&A for the ADS business, SG&A improved by $56 million in 2020 to 10.2% of revenue, a 10-basis-point improvement over 2019. We achieved these results while accelerating our technology investments and despite the revenue decline from the pandemic.  I'm proud of our team for this cost discipline in a difficult economic environment. Fourth quarter capital spending was $394 million and that included $29 million of capital to support the integration of ADS and about $30 million of capital that we intentionally pulled forward given the strong recovery in our operations during the third and fourth quarters. 2020 capital spending was $1.632 billion. Our team showed tremendous discipline throughout 2020 as we focused on reducing capital spending in a targeted manner given the volume declines from the pandemic.  Waste Management generated free cash flow of $2.656 billion in 2020. Given the significant impact of the ADS transaction on this result, let me provide detail on some of the moving pieces. After-tax proceeds from the divestitures of ADS and Waste Management businesses to GFL were $691 million. These proceeds were partially offset by after-tax transaction and advisory costs to support the acquisition of $117 million.  Normalizing for these two items, 2020 free cash flow was $2.082 billion. This result demonstrates the resilient nature of our business and the strength of capital discipline as we nearly achieved our original 2020 free cash flow guidance of $2.15 billion despite the impact of COVID-19.  Given the strong result at the end of 2020, we were positioned to forgo relief provided by the CARES Act and we elected to pay approximately $120 million of payroll taxes that we had planned to defer. As we repay that amount in 2021 and 2022 as anticipated, 2020 free cash flow excluding the ADS impact I mentioned would have been about $2.2 billion for the year, which is better than we expected at the end of the third quarter.  In the fourth quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $231 million in dividend. For the full year, we returned $1.33 billion to shareholders comprised of $927 million in dividends and $402 million in share repurchases.  In November, we issued $2.5 billion of senior notes at an extremely attractive pre-tax weighted average cost of less than 1.5%. This allowed us to repay short-term borrowings used to fund the ADS acquisition at close. 2021 cash interest savings are expected to be more than $90 million.  Fourth quarter total debt-to-EBITDA of 3.19 times and forecasted leverage ratios are both well within the financial covenants of our revolving credit facilities. We are committed to returning to our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times total debt-to-EBITDA during 2021. Our balance sheet and liquidity remain strong and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns.  Moving to our 2021 outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate 10.75% to 11.25% revenue growth in the year ahead with solid organic growth in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5%. This underpins our 2021 operating EBITDA guidance of $4.75 million and $4.9 million. We expect this strong earnings growth to drive free cash flow of between $2.25 billion and $2.35 billion.  Capital expenditures are expected to be between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion in 2021. Excluding about $90 million of capital planned to support the ADS integration this expectation is in line with our long-term capital spend as a percentage of revenue target of 9.5% to 10.5% even while we step up our investments in CSD.  As Jim mentioned, we also see potential incremental investment opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, both of which aid in our sustainability efforts and generate strong returns. As we've now seen improved returns in our state-of-the-art MRFs, we are taking plans to deploy the latest technology and additional MRFs in our network and moving those forward.  We're also planning to invest in more renewable energy plants at our landfills. This investment extends our ability to close the loop between our renewable energy plant and our CNG fleet and does so with very strong economic returns for the company. We remain committed to a capital allocation plan that maximizes long-term value and total shareholder returns.  As announced in December, we are pleased to be increasing our planned quarterly dividend for the 18th consecutive year. We expect our dividend payments to be about $975 million in 2021.  Given our focus on the ADS integration, we expect tuck-in acquisitions to be on the lower end of our typical range of $100 million to $200 million. With more than $1 billion remaining from our free cash flow guidance we plan to allocate that to a combination of debt repayment, share repurchases and the high-return sustainability-focused capital investment opportunities I described earlier.  In closing, I want to thank the Waste Management team for their dedication and adaptability to overcome the unique challenges of 2020. We are stronger than we were a year ago and we're looking forward to a better 2021. With that Lara, let's open the line for questions. No. And the real thing there Hamzah that we're focused on is purchase price allocation impacts to depreciation are difficult to predict. And while we have a really strong view of the purchase price allocation with our 12/31 close, that's something that can get adjusted throughout the next several months. And so the depreciation impacts are something that we'll get better clarity on over the course of the year. But that's one of the things that created noise in EPS and one of the reasons we elected not to guide on that front. It'd be great to know when power and water are coming back. Thank you. Good morning, Tyler. Certainly. So \u2013 and you are absolutely right, there are puts and takes but we still see good strong margin expansion on that path toward 30% that I know that we consistently talk about. The organic revenue and EBITDA growth of our core solid waste business we see improving 30 to 50 basis points in the year ahead. That is going to be partially offset by some known cost headwinds and then also a very intentional increased technology spend level. The increase in technology spending specifically has about a 30-basis-point impact on the margin measure and about a $50 million impact on EBITDA dollars. In terms of the other puts and takes, I would say recycling from a margin perspective, isn't actually one of the things that's contributing to the margin either expansion or detraction. And that's because for us we have the recycling brokerage business, which tends to offset the margin expansion that we see in the traditional MRF business. So as we see the operations improve on the MRF side, we tend to see a little bit of dilution from growth in our brokerage business which is a very good return on invested capital business for us it dilutes margin. On the renewable energy side, there will be some margin expansion and that was strong in the fourth quarter and something that we are basically including in our 2021 guidance based on how we finished the fourth quarter of 2020. So potentially some upside there, if we see RINs prices continue to escalate from where we ended the fourth quarter. And then with regard to the ADS acquisition, I want to pause on that one for a moment. Fourth quarter EBITDA margin was 18.5% for the ADS business. That's below their run rate of 24.5% on a WM measurement basis. As a reminder ADS's EBITDA margin included some adjustments for both share-based compensation and accretion that Waste Management doesn't take in its own EBITDA measure. So, on an apples-to-apples basis ADS's margin was 24.5%. And we have strong confidence that, we'll get them up to about 28% in 2021, and then continue the march to WM levels from that point on. That repays the burden for 2021 and 2022. So the entire $120 million that we had been deferring over the second and third quarters was repaid in Q4. Thank you, Tyler. I think it's a great question and there is no doubt that producing the free cash flow and EBITDA that Waste Management did in 2020 in the face of a global pandemic is a strong affirmation of the strength and resiliency of this business. And so arguably it certainly could position Waste Management to consider a higher leverage ratio than we had historically. That being said our focus on that long-term range of 2.5 to three times is both considering through-cycle financial position that we look to achieve and also establishing financial flexibility for strategic opportunities. And so we want to be sure that we aren't just positioned to weather a storm so to speak but that we're also positioned to be opportunistic to grow the business over the long term. And that's why we think that 2.5 to three times is the right level for strategic value for value creation for shareholders. Yeah. I think it's a great question, and it's one that we've been evaluating. I think the most important element of this for us is that we've been a competitive wage payer as a company for many years. And so, while a minimum wage could certainly effectively raise the tide with regard to where wages are we see that as something that wouldn't disproportionately impact our business and instead is something that we are ahead of in many respects because of where our wages have been historically. It's certainly something that we see the ability to consider if we see that raising -- that rising tide impacts our cost structure, it's something that we would respond to on the price side of the business. Yes. So the $2.2 billion that you remark on is a good place for us to start. I think when we think about EBITDA growth always being the biggest contributor there certainly have strong outlook for EBITDA in the year ahead with a 10% to 13.5% increase on a year-over-year basis. In addition to that, we expect the about $90 million benefit from lower cash interest that I mentioned. Cash taxes will increase with those two items going in the opposite direction and we estimate that to be about $125 million to $150 million. There will be a benefit from the fact that the company, paid the transaction cost that is in your $2.2 billion base. So I want to be sure to point that out because the ADS transaction costs are something that we adjusted for and coming to that $2.2 billion. We will have a slight increase in the money spent on the enterprise resource planning that we've discussed. We expect that to go up $15 million on a year-over-year basis. So all in all that's what gets you to your cash from operations increase in the ballpark of $500 million to $600 million. We've got a capital expenditure increase of around $150 million to $250 million. And then proceeds from divestitures we're not forecasting anything significant there have given our traditional range of $50 million to $100 million. And EBITDA for the renewable energy business was up about $50 million in 2020. What's important to note is that that wasn't all price-related. Some of that was our intentional investment as Jim mentioned that we've been making over the last three to four years. So there was volume and price acceleration in 2020 that provided about $50 million of EBITDA growth. And we see about a $10 million to $15 million improvement in 2021 based on where RINs prices were at the end of 2020. The way that I would look at that Michael is our volume guide at the macro level for 2021 is about 1.5% volume growth. Clearly a lot of that is built into the second quarter just coming off of the very low base of Q2. We do see some upside in the back half of the year. From a service interval perspective, I wouldn't say that we took that volume guidance to the different parts of -- different lines of business specifically such that I can bifurcate what of that is commercial or industrial. But what we looked at based on how our cost structure responded in 2020, we think that the contribution margin of that volume is around 45% in the year ahead. So we have expectations for the ADS business a little north of what you just projected. We have the $50 million increase in technology that I mentioned earlier that is not part of your bridge. And then we have the known cost headwinds that I mentioned. So you can think of those being specifically related to health and welfare costs risk management costs and incentive compensation. Those are about $100 million in the aggregate. So those are the pieces of the bridge in addition to what you outlined. Yes. Yes you did. Yes. The only thing -- so I agree with you 100% that working capital and ADS free cash flow directly to free cash flow. The technology additions that we've mentioned you would have the tax effect. That's the only other item that I would clarify on what you just did, but otherwise I think we're in the same place. And the thing I'd add to that is there's leverage on that as we see better execution with technology to optimize the back-office processes, we've talked about as John and team drive the organization to be more efficient on the road every day. So we've seen tremendous operating and SG&A leverage that helps us to combat inflation. And so those things give us leverage in an inflationary environment as well. Absolutely. Thanks, Michael. Yeah. I would tell you, it's too early for us to tell at this point. The one thing that we did and we've mentioned, from the time that we laid everything out, at Investor Day was accelerate some of the technology spend. And that acceleration of technology spends is one of the things that has kind of put a little bit of downside pressure on the growth rate, in EBITDA that we had talked about. But we expect that to provide an acceleration of the returns coming as soon as 2022. Good point."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. We're very pleased with our strong finish to 2020, both the performance of the legacy Waste Management business and our progress in integrating the ADS operations. As Jim said, our quarterly and full year results really underscore the strength and resiliency of our business model. Improving volumes, healthy pricing and better recycling performance produced organic revenue growth for the first time since the pandemic began. As expected, legacy Waste Management collection and disposal volumes improved sequentially in the fourth quarter from a decline of 5.5% in the third quarter to a decline of 2.7% in the fourth. Fourth quarter MSW volume grew 1.2% and C&D volume, excluding hurricane cleanup, grew 1.8%, both strong indicators of continued economic recovery. While the rate of volume recovery did moderate during the quarter, we did not see a backslide when COVID cases increased in the fall. In fact, as we look at volumes in January, we're encouraged to see improvement from the lull in late November and December. Collection and disposal yield was 2.3% in the fourth quarter and core price was 3.2%. Adjusted for the impact of lower volume, core price would have been 3.8%. In the collection business, we continue to make progress improving the residential line of business. Our residential yield improved 60 basis points to 3.7% in the fourth quarter, compared to the same period in 2019 and was up again sequentially from 3.5% in the third quarter. Residential volumes declined 1.4%, as we shed business that does not meet our return requirements. Overall, our actions to improve the residential line of business in 2020 resulted in $40 million of operating EBITDA benefit and we expect this to carry forward into 2021. In the post-collection business, fourth quarter landfill core price was 3.3% and transfer station core price was 3.1% demonstrating our continued pricing discipline in these key lines of business. Moving to costs. Operating costs were 61.5% of revenue in the fourth quarter, compared to 60.2% in the fourth quarter of 2019. There were some noise in the fourth quarter results. Let me walk you through the difference. In the quarter, as expected, the ADS acquisition increased operating expense as a percentage of revenue by 40 basis points. Additionally, the timing of government approvals for fuel tax credits, which benefited the fourth quarter of 2019 with two years' worth of credits, resulted in a 150-basis-point headwind to operating expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Aside from these impacts, operating costs as a percentage of revenue improved 60 basis points, demonstrating that we are laser-focused on cost control and continue to benefit from a lower cost structure. As an example, commercial yards and industrial halls declined between 5% and 6% during the fourth quarter, yet overtime decreased in the range of 15% to 18% and we see additional opportunities. We also have plenty of opportunity to improve operating costs as a percentage of revenue in the ADS business, as we further integrate operations and work to exceed our planned synergies. Devina will cover our 2021 financial guidance in more detail, but I want to spend a minute on some key components of growth as we look at the year ahead. We are extremely confident in the aspects of our outlook that we can control and we based our guidance on a stabilizing economy, moderate volume growth and disciplined pricing. We expect organic revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of between 4% and 4.5% and overall revenue growth between 10.75% and 11.25% during 2021. We hit the ground running on the ADS integration on October 30 and it's progressing very well. We expect to achieve between $50 million and $60 million in synergies during 2021. Combined with the $10 million to $15 million of annualized synergies already achieved in the fourth quarter, our run rate synergies exiting 2021 is expected to be between $60 million and $75 million. We are extremely confident in achieving these synergies and that we'll be able to capture the remaining synergies in the first half of 2022. About one-third of the 2021 synergies will come from route optimization which will begin early in the second quarter. We estimate that our onetime cost to achieve these synergies will be $50 million in 2021. And as we've mentioned, we plan to adjust the majority of these costs from our results.  As Jim discussed, our recycling and renewal energy businesses are central to our strategy and we're anticipating strong growth from these businesses in the year ahead. We expect continued improvement in recycling from our fee-for-service model, improved operating cost structure at new MRFs and stable demand for recycled materials which together provide a tailwind of between $40 million and $50 million to 2021 operating EBITDA.  We also expect an incremental $10 million of year-over-year contribution from our renewable energy business from the sale of RINs as pricing for those credits has increased over the last several months. Devina will talk more about our plans to invest in these key businesses in 2021.  In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team including our new team members from ADS for their focus in what continues to be difficult and distracting times. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations and I know this will continue in the year ahead.  I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2020 financial results and 2021 financial outlook and further detail. Kyle no, I think I would tell you 90-plus days in I think we're right on track. I think there's been no real surprises. The things that we've encountered have all been things frankly that we've contemplated. We did have the benefit of a longer timeframe getting ready for it. But I would tell you that, I think we're exactly where we should be in fact probably a little bit ahead. As you heard in my script the one area that will take total Q2 to get going in terms of synergies is on the routing side and that has as much to do with data and system migration as it is anything else. And in addition there's some technology improvements that we're making right now in the ADS fleet to be able to take advantage of all the processes that we have in place to drive efficiency. But I would tell you I'm very, very pleased with where we're at so far. I would tell you certainly in the Houston area right now it's been a rough couple of days and this is not nearly a part of the country that deals with this kind of stuff very well as evidenced by what's happening here. But I think outside of Houston, we don't have a real feel for what is going to -- how significant it's going to be going forward outside of really Texas. Well, what I would tell you is, how in my prepared remarks we talked about $40 million of benefit being generated in that line of business in 2020. I would tell you, we still obviously have work to do in 2021. I don't \u2013 we're not going to get there in 2021. And frankly some of the other hills, we're having to climb around COVID and the weights hopefully that's going to moderate in the back half of the year as things, as Jim mentioned, if vaccines get out there and things start to moderate to whatever to normal. In the back half of the year, we're also going to have a better view of what the residential weights are going to look like long term. What I would tell you is not lost in that mix is the fact that our price and yield in residential continues to be strong despite what's going on with CPI, and we've talked about that for the last handful of years. And the other part that's part of that equation is while we talk about the recycling business improving a big piece of the recycling business affects residential. So when you look at those margin improvements, we're overcoming some of those other headwinds that weren't there when we started this initiative so to speak. Well, I think Jeff in terms of sustainability when you really look at where we bottomed out in Q2 and then you look at Q3 and Q4, while the volume declines have essentially been cut by more than half we've still been able to keep a proportionate amount of overtime. And it's really just us being really focused on making sure as volumes fluctuate we optimize each day and each week when it comes to the people and the assets. The operating team is doing a really good job of holding on to that as we bottomed out. And then as we've come back we've just been able to maintain that same level of discipline about making sure that we're maximizing each day and each week on an asset basis. Well, I think if you look at the trend -- we didn't break it out by line of business. But I think overall if you look at the trend from again where we bottomed out to where we finished the year, the second half of the year Q3 trends into Q4, I think you follow those forward proportionately with each of the lines of business. So one area Jim commented on in his script was really around post-collection pricing both at the landfill and transfer station. We've talked about that quarter-in and quarter-out. We continued even through the pandemic to show strength and resiliency in those two buckets. And I commented on residential and that has been even pre-pandemic a real focal area for us. And while it did moderate a bit in the bottom of the pandemic we've shown progress out of that. So I think we feel comfortable with at least that 4% going into 2021. Yeah. Jeff, we said we were probably in the high 60s approaching 70% the last time we chat. And I would still tell you we're hovering a little bit better than that right in the 70% range. And as Jim mentioned, the real gap there is just around those businesses have to return. It's really hospitality the reference to Wrigley Field, travel, lodging those kind of things. So I think the good news is that if you look at how well the business performed even without a lot of those small businesses being back online we feel very confident. As those businesses come back, we'll emerge from this even stronger. I would tell you we're -- when you look at our margin performance relative to that as well I think that's also a testament to how well we performed. And as Jim said, -- to Jim's comment, this is a reopening story I think for the industry and specifically for us. We feel very confident about how the business performs as things start to reopen really in the back half of the year. So what we've traditionally said is about 40% of our revenue is somehow indexed. I think the better metric to look at is really what we've done on core price and yield within residential over really the last six or seven quarters. I'm looking at Devina to make sure. We've shown progress in each and every quarter including three to four and throughout 2020 and we expect that absolutely to continue in 2021. I did mention in my prepared remarks that we did shed a little bit of business here in 2020. But as I've mentioned in a number of these calls, if it doesn't meet our margin and return criteria we're comfortable doing that. It's not our intent, but we're going to make sure that we deploy our capital to where we get reasonable returns and margins. Yes. And we'll circle back with that number. I don't know if I'd go back to 2019. What I would look at is where we bottomed out in Q2 and what our overtime percentages we're going into that and how we've come out of it. To me that's really been the barometer as this volume declines have really come back more than half in commercial and industrial. As for obvious reasons residential is a little different. But we've been able to outpace the volume increases if you will from an overtime perspective, for us to be down mid-teens and overtime with still 5%, 6%, 7% volume declines is pretty impressive. So I don't know about 2019. David I think the better barometer for us is how we've done in 2020 and how we progressed from the peak of volume decline to where we are now. And I think as I mentioned that's what gives us confidence going into 2021 and then add in the benefit of us getting into the integration of the ADS customers after we migrate the data here in Q2. All those things I think add up to a really positive outlook for us on the OpEx side. The only thing I would add there with the new administration, I think two things that the new administration will deal with is the RVO, which is a Renewable Volume Obligation and a small refinery exemption, which are two buckets that have really driven RIN pricing in the past, right because there's been a lack of clarity on that. And I think if they stabilize both of those, we're going to see some more stability in RIN pricing, whether it stays at $2.50 or whatever. But I think we'll see more stability and I think that's going to help inform us where we deploy our own capital. Thank you. Thanks, Michael. And Jim, the one example, I gave is if you think about contaminated soil. That's a place where this PFAS resides, regularly. And we look at our landfills, as being a perfect solution for that, with the right technology on the back end. I would only add Devina is that, when you think about, when and how we bought ADS, they were very similar to us in terms of the volume declines. They were suffering through Q2 and Q3. So as Jim talked about, in the traditional business being a reopening story we think there's obviously some leverage of ADS business, now tucked in reopening and us getting the same lift out of that. Thanks, Stephanie."

Any redistribution, retransmission or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the expressed written consent of Waste Management is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to open the call by welcoming the employees and customers of Advanced Disposal to the Waste Management family. We closed the acquisition last week, and we're excited about the opportunity ahead to create value from this deal. We're also pleased with a concurrent close with GFL Environmental on the divestiture package. I'd like to give credit to Richard Burke and the Advanced Disposal team for the great job they did, staying focused on operating their business safely and efficiently during the extended closed period. The next phase of our journey, the hard work of combining these two great companies has now begun. John will speak a bit more on this topic, but suffice it to say, we're very confident in the long-term value of the acquisition. And the integration is off to a great start. We're extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which were a testament, both to our team's ability to optimize our business in a new environment, as well as the progress of the economic recovery in North America. We've consistently pointed to operating EBITDA as the best measure of the health of our business. And despite the challenging backdrop, we delivered third quarter operating EBITDA results in line with last year's record performance and expanded operating EBITDA margin by 70 basis points. It's been said many times that great companies are able to emerge from tough times stronger than they were going in. In that vein, WM has learned this year that we can permanently operate our business with a lower cost structure. Despite a 2.7% decline in our third quarter revenues, the team was able to improve operating expense as a percent of revenue by 110 basis points and hold SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue relatively flat. This is the second consecutive quarter where we've demonstrated this flexibility in a difficult operating environment. And we're committed to holding on to operating efficiencies and cost savings as our volumes turn positive again. In addition to proactively changing the cost structure of our business, we're taking steps that propel us forward as a stronger, more differentiated company in the eyes of our customers. As I discussed last quarter, our investments in customer service digitalization or CSD are unquestionably the right approach. And we've accelerated these investments to reap the benefits sooner. So far this year, we've made considerable progress on this effort that will fundamentally transform our business model by offering our customers greater choice in how to interact with us and by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes. And we've started to see the benefits. Our online sales channel is our fastest growing sales channel. And we've seen an increase in our conversion rates for customers that signing up for new service when visiting our e-commerce site. We've also made progress in automating a variety of operational back office and customer communication processes, which are paving the way for efficiency gains, improved customer experience and further cost reduction. To support our CSD journey, we modified our field sales structure to expand online and inside sales functions, while reducing and optimizing outside sales coverage. These adjustments are part of our long-term vision to position our team to engage with customers on the customer's terms, improving customer satisfaction and engagement. It also enables us to reduce our costs of new customer acquisition and improve sales performance at a more efficient cost. We're confident that these strategic sales coverage adjustments coupled with our visual growth strategy, better support our customers as well as the long-term growth of the business. Recycling continues to show the improved results that we expected when we started to change the business model, providing stronger financial results in the third quarter. In addition to our new highly automated MRF in Chicago, we've opened a similar facility in Salt Lake City, with another to open soon in Raleigh. Using advanced technology in our recycling facilities is the blueprint for improving our cost structure, producing a higher quality material and being flexible to changing recycling end-market demands. Recycling is only the beginning of our commitment to sustainability. Last month, we published our 2020 sustainability report, building value together. The report describes how we are addressing challenges and opportunities related to ESG and doing so in close partnership with our customers, suppliers, and communities. Through the crisis of 2020, we've remained steadfast in our commitments to protecting the environment and contributing to a circular economy. WM is a leading voice in the call to create domestic end-market demand for recycled content. One of the ways we're walking the talk is our collaboration with Cascade Cart Solutions to develop and purchase residential carts made with post-consumer resin. Another way is our investment in continuous materials, a company which develops building materials from hard to recycle paper and plastics. Increasing the value of the material that we process, increases the economic benefits from recycling which drives volumes and benefits the environment. The shift in our operating model, along with benefits from the acquisition of ADS and our progress in transforming the recycling business positions for a strong finish to the year with positive momentum heading into 2021. We've performed exceptionally well despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19. Our results in the first nine months of the year, give us confidence. We can generate free cash flow in excess of $2 billion exclusive of ADS transaction costs. As we also achieved the highest operating EBITDA margin in the company's history in the third quarter, we're confident we can exceed the high end of our guidance for full year operating EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%. After all we've been through this year, what's most impressive is we expect to finish 2020 within a stone's throw of our all-time high 2019 operating EBITDA. For that I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim and good morning. Our third quarter results showcase the strong execution of our front-line team members who are safely and efficiently servicing our customers each day, as well as the resilience of our business model as we manage costs and capital expenditures in this dynamic environment. The team's hard work paid off with tremendous results as we improved operating expenses as a percentage of revenue a 110 basis points and expanded operating EBITDA margins of 70 basis points. We saw a steady volume recovery across the collection and disposal business during the third quarter, improving volumes, coupled with collection and disposal yield returning to a healthy 2.6%, generated revenue above our expectations. We were anticipating a revenue decline of 3.5% to 5.5% in the second half of the year with the majority of that decline weighted toward the third quarter, yes, the third quarter revenue only declined 2.7%. Of the commercial volume suspended due to the pandemic, almost 70% have resumed service and there is further cause for optimism in the C&I business as net new business and service increases versus service decreases were both positive and showed significant sequential improvement in the third quarter. Residential container waste continued to be elevated mid-to-high single-digits compared to last year. Recovering the cost of increased waste as part of our conversation with municipalities as we work to improve the profitability of our residential business and change the structure of residential contracts. In the residential line of business, our yield improved to 3.5% as we make progress on this effort. External volumes for the third quarter were down \u2013 external landfill volumes for the third quarter were down just over 8% with special waste volumes down about 12% and C&D volumes down about 19%, on a tough comparison in part due to wildfire cleanup last year. Without the cleanup from last year, C&D volumes declined about 7%. Landfill volumes improved sequentially each month in the quarter with total landfill volumes in September down less than 4% and C&D and special waste each down about 8%. Notably MSW volume was flat for the quarter and September volumes increased nearly 2% year-over-year, a powerful indicator of the progress of economic recovery. Moving to pricing. Third quarter core price was 3.2%, adjusted for the impact of lower volume core price would be 4.1%. As expected, pricing metrics are trending back toward pre-pandemic levels following the intentional customer focused steps we took to support our small business customers during spring shutdowns. We're confident in helping our customers during a difficult economic climate was the right step and we continue to see increased loyalty from our customers. Third quarter churn improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 8.8% and we saw another boost in our net promoter scores for all business lines we measure. In particular, our commercial business scored more than doubled, driven by higher scores for reliability, flexibility and improved online resources. Our pricing results reflect 3.3% core price in both landfill and transfer businesses as we continue the positive momentum with post collection pricing initiatives. We've been disciplined with our post collection pricing and we remain committed to staying the course. Turning to ADS. No one has been more eager than me to welcome the ADS team to Waste Management. And with the closing behind us, we're extremely confident in the value this deal will deliver. We've gotten significant clarity on the ADS business and are pleased with the recovery the business has shown as the economy has reopened. We work closely with the ADS team for many months and are hard at work on integration, giving us confidence that we will exceed $100 million synergy target, despite higher than originally expected divestitures. As Jim mentioned, 2020 has taught us we can operate our business with a much lower cost structure than we have historically. And we're holding on to operating efficiencies and cost savings as volumes return. The 110 basis point improvement in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in a third quarter is evidence of our success. When volumes began to decline in March, we aggressively flexed our routes and trucks parking more than 800 vehicles at peak declines. This lowered maintenance costs and allowed us to optimize volumes across the younger and lower cost portion of the fleet. Throughout the pandemic route reductions have outpaced volume declines in the commercial and industrial lines of business. As volumes have returned, we have been extremely disciplined in bringing back trucks into service, driving improved asset utilization and helping to keep maintenance costs low. In the third quarter, lower maintenance spending resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in operating expense as a percentage of revenue. We've also been successful in improving efficiency as each week since February, we service more yards, homes and halls per hour than in the same period in 2019. Increased efficiency was a key driver of less overtime in the quarter, while volume decreases across the collection and disposal business were in the mid single-digits, over time was down 21% in the commercial and industrial lines of business and over time was down 27% in the disposal business. The team is doing an exceptional job of managing expenses and I'm confident we are carrying forward the lessons we've learned on safely operating our business at a lower cost structure. In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team, including our new advanced disposal team members for their hard work and dedication during trying times. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations on virtually all measures as we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our operations in an uncertain environment. I will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss her financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. As Jim and John have discussed, our third quarter 2020 results have demonstrated both the strong foundation provided by our essential services and resilient business model and the value created from the hard work of our team who are delivering each day in an increasingly cost-effective way. When we look at our third quarter operating and financial results, as John just said, virtually every metric exceeded the expectations we set just three months ago. Volumes have come back stronger than expected. We have flexed operating costs to drive improved margins, and that's far better than our targeted efforts to keep them flat. And we've seen improved customer account collection trends take hold. All of this positions us to finish the year strong with organic revenue down in the range of 3.25% to 3.75% versus the 4% to 5% we projected in July, targeted operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5% and free cash flow in excess of $2 billion. With revenues down about 2.7% from the prior year quarter, our operating EBITDA was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. This strong result, underpinned net cash flow from operations, which was $1.29 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the same quarter last year. Over the course of the third quarter, we saw strong recovery in our customer collections and day sales outstanding, lessening the expected headwind from working capital. Additionally, our operating cash flow for the quarter includes the deferral of payroll tax payments under the CARES act, which provided a benefit of about $40 million. We continue to expect the full year benefit of payroll tax deferral to be $120 million. Third quarter capital spending was $343 million, a $140 million decrease from the same quarter in 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we took prudent steps to reduce and defer certain aspects of our capital spending until we had better visibility into the pace of volume recovery. The majority of the targeted reductions were the results of adjustments and landfill cell construction schedules and a decrease in the purchase of steel containers. We expect full year capital expenditures to be between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Our business generated free cash flow of $691 million in the third quarter, through the first nine months of the year free cash flow was 1.432 billion, a conversion of cash from operating EBITDA of [Technical Difficulty]. And as I just mentioned for the full year, we expect our strong operating performance, effective management of working capital and disciplined capital spending to yield free cash flow an excess of $2 billion, excluding the impacts of ADS. Our strong free cash flow positions as to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we paid $230 million in dividends. We remain fully committed to our dividend program, solid balance sheet and balanced allocation of remaining available cash to strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. With the recent closing and funding of the ADS acquisition, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns. We financed the $4.6 billion acquisition of ADS net of the $856 million in proceeds from the divestiture to GFL Environmental with a combination of our credit facilities and commercial paper. We continue to look for the right window to access the capital markets for long-term financing alternatives. Current and forecasted leverage ratios are well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facilities, and we expect to quickly return to our targeted total debt to EBITDA of 2.5 to 3 times. Turning to SG&A costs. There is no doubt that the lessons we\u2019re taking to heart from the pandemic have extended to SG&A as well. While third quarter SG&A was slightly above prior year at $389 million, that increases due to an accrual for long-term incentive compensation, as well as an intentional acceleration in technology and investments that Jim mentioned earlier. Absent these two items, our SG&A would have been down nearly $30 million from the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating our collective commitment to reduce discretionary spending. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.1% despite the revenue decline in the quarter. And we continue to target SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 10%. Before turning the call over for questions, I want to provide an overview of our planned approach to updating financial guidance post ADS. With the close of the acquisition just behind us, the entire team is focused on welcoming ADS employees and serving our new customers. Each company produced outstanding third quarter results and we are confident that we will finish 2020 strong, as a collective team. Our integration plans are robust and as John just mentioned, we're confident that we can achieve planned synergies. This is an integrated business model and for that reason developing estimates for the cost associated with routes from a partially divested hauling district can be difficult. We are well underway in analyzing and evaluating our financial plans for the year ahead and we will clearly delineate a plan with our fourth quarter 2020 results, that speaks to the top strategic priorities of Waste Management and the integrated value of ADS. Suffice it to say, we closed 2020 excited about the road ahead and prepared to make the value of the whole greater than the sum of its parts. In closing, I want to thank our team for all they have accomplished. Our strong results are a testament to the resilience of both our people and our business model. With that, Lindsay, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is now open.\nTyler Brown: Hey good morning, everyone.\nJim Fish: Good morning, Tyler.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning.\nTyler Brown: Hey Devina. So I appreciate that, you'll give some more details in January, but just at a high level, when we think about the moving pieces for 2021 cash flow, is it basically that we take your kind of jumping off point maybe layer in some EBITDA growth, add in ADS. But then should we also take away for some CARES repayments and maybe a step up in legacy CapEx? Are those kind of the big buckets? Not necessarily numbers, but just the puts and takes.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. You absolutely have those buckets right.\nTyler Brown: So on CARES, is it half of it will come back next year and then another half in 2022?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, that's correct. So the $120 million that we have reduced our 2020 cash outlay will repay all \u2013 we'll have a full year in the year ahead for normal course of business and then 50% of this year's outlay.\nTyler Brown: Right. Okay, good. That's very helpful. And then John, so at the Investor Day, I think you talked about $100 million in savings over the next few years from productivity. But you guys have noted that COVID has driven you guys to structurally rethink a lot of things, and it seems like this productivity is not necessarily going to go away. So I guess my question is have those savings that you talked about at Investor Day basically been captured or are those in 100 savings still on the come?\nJohn Morris: No, I think Tyler, I mean, listen, we\u2019re very pleased with what the teams have been able to do to control cost and a lot of that's been done through efficiency over time, better maintenance and repair results, et cetera. So we've taken full advantage of it, but that's not to suggest that we don't have some more opportunity within the operating expense categories.\nTyler Brown: Okay, great. And so maybe just my last question again, a kind of a bigger question here. But I mean, I think if you guys crest 28.5% margins, I think it's maybe the best margins you've ever posted. I'd have to go back and maybe look at one of Bill's old models, But, over the next few years, do you feel that 30% margins are achievable? And if so, maybe what might be some of the drivers to get you there?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. Well, I think what John just mentioned should give everyone confidence that the 28.5% year-to-date EBITDA margin that we have produced through really tough circumstances, this isn't kind of indication of what we can achieve, it's an indication of what's yet to come in terms of additional incremental value that can be created from here, while we look at EBITDA margin for the year, there are always puts and takes. I think what's important to know is that in the current year, we look at those puts and takes and say sure, it\u2019s something like health and welfare expenses that were lower and the second quarter may work against us in the year ahead. But what's more important is that the operating performance and the ability to lever down on discretionary spending. Those things are indicative of long-term value creation on the margin front, and those will far outpace that health and welfare headwinds that we have in 2021.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you very much.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you, Tyler.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJeff Goldstein: Hey, good morning. I wanted to ask on the core price going up \u2013 good morning. I just want to ask on the core price going up to 3.2% from 1.3% last quarter. At this point, are you fairly confident that you can get back to the pre-COVID core price levels of about 4% sooner or rather than later, as you're now just waiting to remove the last set of price concessions? Or do you think that last amount of the recovery will be harder to come by as maybe a certain amount of customers will continue to be under pressure? Just how should we be thinking about that?\nJim Fish: It's a good question because, there was \u2013 there were a lot of moving parts in the second quarter and we talked about the fact that we were supporting our small business customers in the second quarter, and that would all be reflected in price, whether it was the free month of service or whether it was deferred price increases, all that would show up on the price line. So we knew that Q2 was going to be artificially low, and Q3 had a piece of that in there as well. So we're confident that the pricing will remain a core strength for us in Q4 and beyond, whether it is commercial or roll off or more recently John's focus and our focus as a team on residential pricing and landfill pricing. Those are all going to be strengths of ours. It's a little bit of the last question about margin in addition to cost controls that we're confident in, we're also equally confident in our price capabilities.\nJeff Goldstein: Okay. That's helpful. And then I think I'd ask with the election tomorrow, just curious how you're thinking about the range of outcomes here and while tax I'm sure is probably the most obvious variable. Is there anything else we should related to regulation that you're keeping an eye on that we should be aware of as well?\nDevina Rankin: I'll speak quickly to the tax impacts. When we look at Biden win the thing that is most apparent there is federal tax rates could increase from 21% currently to 28%. That's about a 6.5% increase in our effective tax rate based on our current modeling. And that would be about $150 million increase in the provision and about $125 million in cash taxes. Really hard to predict further than that, we know that bonus appreciation is something that seems to have bipartisan support. And so therefore, we expect a 100% expensing to continue through 2022 and then the phase out to continue thereafter. Aside from that, I'll let Jim speak to the impacts to the rest of the business.\nJim Fish: Yes. I would just change one word in Devina\u2019s sentence, if we look at Biden win, we will \u2013 regarding environmental regulation, it is interesting for us that \u2013 first off, all of our focus is not necessarily on the federal elections, we tend to focus on state elections too, because the state has such an important place, such an important role for us, and that carries over to environmental regulation. But as it relates to the federal elections tomorrow, we've said that regulation is actually in a strange way, a good thing for WM, because we hold ourselves to a very high regulatory standard, environmental standard. And so any additional regulation actually tends to work in our favor. So to the extent that, that comes out of tomorrow's election, that could be a good thing for us.\nJeff Goldstein: That's all really helpful color. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\nHamzah Mazari: Hey, good morning. Maybe for Jim, you've talked about technology for a few years now and we see in your prepared comments some of the accelerated tax spend that you flagged. Could you maybe at a high level just talk about where you are in your tech journey sort of what's behind you and what's yet to come, both from a spend perspective and sort of the benefits? Did the benefits come right away or is that a little bit of a lag?\nJim Fish: I think there is a bit of a lag here, Hamzah. We have accelerated the spend as we mentioned \u2013 Devina mentioned and it's impacting SG&A costs. And we felt like this was the right year to do it. This \u2013 I think I read somewhere that 77% of companies have done the same thing, have accelerated their digital spend. If \u2013 just to kind of put it in \u2013 to be specific about what it's impacting though and what it's impacted so far. Things like customer setup is being impacted, routing and dispatch, service confirmation, billing, inquiries, all of those make up the pie of calls, that come into our call centers. And the idea is that we'll give that option at least to our customers to be able to self service. And then behind the scenes there will be a real significant streamlining of really all of those processes. Today there is a lot of steps involved, there is a lot of data entry involved, ideally we get to a point where you greatly reduce the amount of data entry, which reduces the amount of potential for error. And then in turn reduces the confusion, sometimes that results from those errors when a customer calls in. I would tell you that we're \u2013 if I use kind of a baseball analogy here, that we're probably in inning three here, as it relates to this full customer service digitalization, and that will take us all the way through 2021 to fully develop. But we are moving quickly on it and we're encouraged by what we're seeing, not just on those process changes, but also on the front-end of that, which is where the customer sees it. As I mentioned in my script, we're seeing \u2013 our increases are coming in that e-commerce channel. So we're excited about this, and we think this has the real potential to separate us from the pack even more significantly going forward,\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Very helpful. And then just on the volume side, anything you're seeing sort of regionally relative to your expectations, that was a bit different. And then maybe just frame for us, what does October looks like? I know you gave some detail on September. Just curious if the \u2013 sort of the recovery that we've seen during the quarter is similar to October, or if there is differences we should be aware of when looking at the commercial business.\nJim Fish: It's interesting Hamzah, we've \u2013 I've read a couple of reports that have talked about volume being different in the urban settings versus rural. I would tell you, this is not an urban versus a rural, the impact of COVID is not been urban versus rural. What it's really been is almost state-by-state and province by province. So the States that seem to be doing the best and are closest to full recovery happened to be those States that opened up most quickly. So those are States like Texas, like Florida, like Arizona, Georgia, those States are doing best when we look at our own data on the States that are lagging are States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, and then provinces like Ontario and Quebec. Those have been most stringent on reopening and are the farthest behind. I would tell you here in Texas, it's full steam ahead, we've been going out to restaurants for a number of months now, at least in our family and we're outs both nights this weekend, and it is full steam ahead here. The businesses that tend to be lagging, the sectors are still hospitality, still sports, entertainment, schools to some degree and then the related small businesses there that touch those sectors. But overall, I would tell you that I think we are seeing a full reopening, I think what we're seeing is that people are just saying they can't be shut down forever, they have to \u2013 their businesses, particularly small businesses that is there. That's the way they put food on the table. And so I don't expect those small businesses to continue to be shut down forever. And when will these States fully reopened? I don't know. Some of that depends on the extent of COVID and the pursuit of a vaccine, but if I had to guess, if you pressed me on it, I would say mid-to-late 2021, you'll see most of these States and provinces be reopened.\nHamzah Mazari: Got you. And just last question, I'll turn it over. Is the ADSW, I know we'll get more detail and I know that you have to look at the divestitures and et cetera. But it's that free cash flow accretive next year to you guys? Or we just wait for more details at Q4? Just any high level thoughts.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, Hamzah. I would say we absolutely expect the acquisition to be free cash flow accretive in the year ahead. The free cash flow impacts to the fourth quarter, we're expecting that to be more like a push even potentially a little bit on the downside, because of some of the cost to achieve and starting to make investments on the capital investment side as we integrate some of our sites. So I would say fourth quarter impacts is either flat to down on the free cash flow front. And then we really start to see the benefits of full run rate of the ADS EBITDA combined with early indications of our synergy capture and a lower capital cost as well, as we refinance the required indebtedness.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you so much.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Hamzah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is now open.\nKevin Chiang: Hi, thanks for taking my question here. Maybe just following up on Hamzah\u2019s question there. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks about 70% of commercial had seen some sort of resumption. To the extent you start seeing some sort of softness, especially in provinces and States that that may be more likely to lock things down again. Just wondering if the lessons you've learned from the lockdowns you saw in March and April. Would you approach things differently with your commercial customers? Or as the game plan you saw six months ago, the same game plan you would implement in another re-lockdown down in some of these markets?\nJim Fish: Yes. I don't think we would approach things differently. That doesn't mean we're going to come back out with another free month of service for small customers. And to the extent that States lockdown, I mean, there has been a bit of an ebb and flow there with some States. But again the States that have at least from an economic standpoint have done the best in this recovery are those States that have been pretty consistent about staying open and then trying to put protocols in place to protect against spikes in COVID. And those are States like Texas and like Arizona and Florida and Georgia. So I think we would handle it the same way. And \u2013 but going forward, I don't anticipate offering another deferral of price increases or another free month of service to small businesses.\nDevina Rankin: I think it's equally important to think about how we responded with our employees. And it goes without saying that when you look at turnover, as well as employee morale and safety results, that our response on the employee front we think was exactly what it needed to be and we would repeat those steps. Some of the costs though that we incurred, particularly for the back office, as we moved folks into work from home mode, those were one-time and we wouldn't look to see those repeat.\nKevin Chiang: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just a second one for me. Just went through your sustainability report, you highlighted the progress you've made and some of the targets you have over the next few years here. At a high level to get to some of those targets, do you see the need to maybe in the near-term here, see some level of capital intensity creep as you invest in some of these technologies? Or with the integration of ADS, is there any catch-up CapEx there to bring ADS up to the targets that you want to achieve as a company, as a whole?\nJim Fish: Well, two questions there, and I'm going to let John take the second one about ADS. The first one related to sustainability. It's a fair question. We don't necessarily see any capital creep related to our focus on sustainability. Look, we've been focused on sustainability, it's not something we've been focused on for two quarters, it's something we've been focused on for probably 10 years, but more specifically for the last five years. And we managed through that and to the extent there is any capital needs, it just gets built into our budget.\nJohn Morris: I think the second part of the question with regard to ADS, we've obviously had a good bit of time to study their capital structure in the business. And the short answer is we don't see that as a capital drag. They've been very deliberate and intentional on how they've capitalized the business and we feel comfortable that they're in a good spot as we start the integration.\nKevin Chiang: Thank you very much. Thanks for taking my question.\nJim Fish: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle White with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nKyle White: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on closing the ADS deal.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Kyle.\nKyle White: Let me focus a little bit \u2013 focus on some contracts and as you renegotiate contracts, especially on the residential side. Are there any key differences that you've been able to implement into the contract structure as a result of the pandemic? Any kind of real examples of change here?\nJohn Morris: Yes. I mean, listen, Kyle, we've been talking about residential loan before COVID and I think if you look at the results that Jim commented on what we've done on the core price and yield side with regard to residential. I think and I said this on the last call that the additional pressure, if you will that the volumes because of people working from home, it does present another challenge and we're having those conversations with municipalities and with the franchises. What I'm really happy about is if you look at even the margins in residential now, even with what's gone on recycling and to some extent what's going on with this pandemic in the additional ways, we're still showing margin progress there. I think the conversation around the pandemic and the weights and whatnot. It seems to have leveled out and as we said kind of the mid-to-high single-digits depending on where you are in the country and that's a conversation we're going to continue to have. And it's a challenging conversation, a lot of these municipalities are facing budget constraints or whatnot, but I would tell you where we're having success is getting the price up, being paid adequately for the service we're providing. But our public sector team has really done a nice job of really partnering with these municipalities and working with them on ways where they can streamline maybe some of the service offerings, still achieve what they need for their residents and still allow us to be compensated at an inappropriate level.\nKyle White: That's helpful. And then going back to sustainability, you have been one of the more aggressive companies to shift to CNG fleets, with I believe around 60% of your collection fleet using CNG with a target of around 70% by 2025. How should we think about this target in regards to some of the innovation that's been happening on the battery electric side? Are you considering potentially slowing down your CNG purchases to kind of wait and see how electric performs?\nJohn Morris: No. Kyle, I would tell you we're very happy with where we are on our CNG conversion. We're running right now because we've taken some trucks off the street, we're actually running close to 70% right now of our routed vehicles. And I think part of what you're seeing in our improved maintenance and repair numbers and whatnot is due to us running a younger more efficient fleet, that's the majority of which CNG. I will tell you on the other alternatives, electric vehicles in particular, we've got a number of pilots going on with different vendors. I mean, that's still a developing technology, I think for the heavy duty vehicle class that was really a focus for us, there is still a little bit of wood to chop there. And I think, when we get to the point where it's advanced, we're going to have to be very careful with who we picked in terms of the technology leader.\nKyle White: All right, I'll turn it over. Good luck with the integration.\nJohn Morris: Thank you.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone.\nJim Fish: Good morning, Walter.\nJohn Morris: Good morning.\nWalter Spracklin: And I look to come back to volume and the discussion around the potential risks that we do see some jurisdictions go back into a tighter COVID-19 lockdown while others are opening quicker. And just really kind of put it all together and your jurisdictions adding it all together, Jim, just a simple question. I mean, do you see the volume that you saw in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter going to be better or worse than what you saw in the third quarter? I know one of your peers has kind of I think conservatively guided to a flat to technically, I guess, slightly worse volume performance in the fourth quarter. But given the cadence and seeing where your jurisdictions are, what would be your best guess in terms of fourth quarter, better or worse?\nJim Fish: We think it will be relatively flat. I think it's such a difficult question, because of how States manage their reaction to somebody spikes in COVID. We're sitting here in Texas and I think Texas, whether you talk about the Mayor here in Houston or the Governor. I think Texas actually \u2013 we went through our own spike back in July and part of August, and the State managed its way, the city of Houston managed its way through that quite well. So we didn't re-shut down as we were in April and May, we just put stronger protocols in place and we\u2019re more \u2013 we were tougher on those who were offending, but we did not go back and shut down businesses. Now that's not my decision, that's the decision of the Governor of Texas and the Mayors of these cities. But I think Texas is a pretty good indicator of how to handle it without crushing businesses, but also making sure that we're keenly aware of the danger of spike in COVID. I don't know whether some of these other States will handle it the same way. So as a consequence, we're projecting relatively flat volume in Q4. I think Hamzah asked earlier, and I didn't really answer the question, how we're looking in October. And just as I said with the quarter, October is looking pretty similar to what September look like. So relatively flat, a few things are lower, a few things are higher. But overall, we expect that the volume will be flat from Q3 to Q4.\nWalter Spracklin: I appreciate that. Following-up on the margin question. I know operating margin has been a key focus for a lot of investors across a lot of different industries as volumes come back here. And in some sectors it's pretty obvious where operating leverage exists and how it's going to come together. When I look at waste, I do hear you on items such as lower SG&A, lower corporate travel and so on. But I just think about the what a higher volume would mean in terms of increased congestion that would come with \u2013 traffic congestion, that would hamper fluidity in your pickup operations. I think about over time that you had before and whether in a normal volume environment to what extent you can manage that down manage that better than pre-COVID, and then some of the health and welfare costs that are coming in. When I put all that together, the line of sight toward clear operating leverage in the waste sector isn\u2019t as obvious and perhaps Jim, you can correct me there or give me a little bit of insight as to where operating leverage might come in for your business.\nJim Fish: Well, okay. We've said \u2013 John said in his scripts and he can add color here. But what \u2013 really are the big takeaway for us in \u2013 particularly in Q3, but also to a lesser extent in Q2 was that we now believe, we can truly operate this business at a lower operating cost structure. Devina also talked about SG&A. And so in all the obvious areas, things like travel and some of the discretionary spend, we know that we can run at SG&A that's lower than previously thought. But most importantly, when we look at what John discussed in his prepared remarks, we absolutely believe that as we climb back to volume break even and then start to accelerate again, that we've learned that we can operate at a operating cost structure. There are \u2013 as you mentioned, there are some things that will impact our operation such as traffic. But when I look at \u2013 I use Houston a lot because I sit here, but I look at charts for Houston traffic every week, put out by a group here in \u2013 of the greater Houston partnership. And Houston traffic is almost back to pre-COVID levels. When you look at the city of Houston for us, we are still looking similar to the rest of our business in terms of overtime. So it gives me confidence that while traffic will certainly create some snarls in our operations, that we'll be able to hang on to these efficiency gains that we're picking up. And then to add to that what we're doing with digitalization. And I believe that's why we firmly believe that this is a long-term sustainable approach to it, a new approach to our operations. John, anything to add on.\nJohn Morris: The only thing our used coverage. And the only thing I'd add Walter is, we do have a lot of granular data on the density of volumes we're picking up and how that's been eroded and now come back. And to Jim's point, we're talking about 70% give or take of our C&I business coming back that was eroding yet you still see a very wide gap in the efficiency and the overtime ratio. So we're almost back to kind of a normal traffic pattern in a lot of places, and then some of that friction's return yet the operating folks are doing a great job of hanging on to the savings.\nWalter Spracklin: Some great examples, really appreciate the time guys.\nJim Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nSean Eastman: Good morning team.\nJim Fish: Hi, Sean.\nSean Eastman: With the advanced disposal deal having closed, I wanted to ask about this for a while, we haven't been able to talk to the advanced for some time. It's just interesting, the timing of the acquisition around this pretty nice inflection they saw in average yields in 2018 that it seems like they have held on to really well through the first half of 2020. So I'm just hoping you guys could sort of refresh us on that dynamic over there, sort of what's driven that inflection? And then is it fair to say that, once that gets folded into the WM footprint, there is potential for some additional momentum on that line as a combined company.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Sean. That\u2019s a good question, a couple of questions in there. One is, if you \u2013 obviously, in our prepared remarks, we reiterated again, how confident we feel about exceeding to $100 million synergy target. And that's obviously in a sort of post-COVID environment. I think Richard and the team have done a really nice job in the first half of the year as evidenced by their results and their recovery especially in the geographies that they were in the 16 States that advanced was in. And as Jim mentioned in his comments, we've been comparing those recovery rates and those geographies and the advanced portfolio came back nicely. And as Devina mentioned in her comments the third quarter both companies perform really well. So if you think about \u2013 even though we're in a COVID environment, even though the divestitures were higher, we're still very confident in our synergy number as we roll into Q4 and into 2021.\nSean Eastman: Got you. That's helpful. And one for Devina, just a refresh on the financing of the transaction, just trying to understand what happened with \u2013 what happened with ADSW\u2019s debt. I guess, basically what is WM\u2019s combined company cost of debt at close? And are there any interest savings there built into the synergy target or is that separate?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So I'll start with just where we were from a leverage perspective immediately following the close. And that's about 3.15 times, including pro forma EBITDA. So it really does speak to the solid financial position of Waste Management. And so when we look at that number, we think that both when you combine synergy capture, as well as growth in both businesses will be quickly to our targeted leverage ratios over the course of 2021. As it relates to ADS\u2019 debt that was immediately repaid upon close and simply by taking that indebtedness and replacing it with WM\u2019s debt. We see an immediate synergy value from that in the ballpark of $40 million on a gross basis, so after tax, clearly a lower number than that. That is not something that was specifically contemplated in the $100 million of synergies. That relates to operating performance and SG&A rationalization. And we'll be executing upon those strategies over the course of the next year.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Helpful. Very helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Manthey with Baird. Your line is now open.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I'm sure it's hard to see through the seasonal factors of the business, but are you seeing any [Audio Dip] and C&D waste is seeing a surge, maybe from projects that were delayed from the second quarter as those are wrapped up. And what I'm asking is, is there any chance in your mind that we could see a double dip in that part of the business?\nJim Fish: So I think your question was largely around special waste and projects there. And so what we're seeing with special waste and to some degree C&D. C&D is a bit cloudy, the picture is cloudy because of last year and the fire volume from last year. And as John mentioned, if you normalize for that, it's maybe 7% down year-over-year, as opposed to 19% down. But primarily with special waste, what we're seeing is that these large companies that own these special waste projects, that there's some discretion in the timing of the initiation of those projects. So our pipeline looks quite good at this point. And the big question is when will they initiate those projects? Many of them as you might expect, have been delayed in 2020. And we expect that they will build those projects into their budgets for 2021, after this unpredictability goes away from 2020.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. And second, have you discussed thoughts on when you might reinstate share repurchase just yet?\nDevina Rankin: As I just mentioned, when we look at 2021 and see a clear path to leverage in our targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times, we're really optimistic that we'll be able to resume share repurchases at some point in 2021. We always revisit our capital allocation plans in the fourth quarter. And we'll do that again this year with expectations for clarity on the dividend in the extent of 2021 share buyback at that time. But we will remain focused on balanced allocation to a combination of the M&A and share buyback with excess free cash flow.\nDavid Manthey: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning, everyone. I'd like to start with a follow-up question on pricing. And would note by the way the 2.6% collection disposal yield is a very strong result, even pre-pandemic. But you said, I think, John, earlier that core price would have been 4.1%, if not core volume. Can you just disambiguate that a little bit for folks explain that? And then really the correlated question is as we move into the fourth quarter here and will be on some of the concessions, do we see price continuing to improve sequentially?\nJohn Morris: So the short answer to the second part is yes. I think what we've talked about as we went through Q2 and into Q3 is that those delivered concessions were going to have an impact, but we thought making a one quarter concession to those customers was the right thing to do. And honestly, from everything we've seen from the feedback from our customers around Net Promoter Score, I commented on. That it's absolutely been the right move. I think what you're seeing from Q2 to Q3, in particular in commercial and industrial where most of those concessions were made, as you saw a nice recovery. We're not all the way back up to where we were, but what we've all said throughout this pandemic when we've been chatting with you folks is that this is not a change in our strategy or our philosophy, but it was a short-term decision made to ease some of the \u2013 what was going on with our customer. So I think when you look at the bridge between Q2 and Q3, we'll see continued momentum as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year.\nNoah Kaye: That's very helpful. And in respect to my fellow analysts, I'll jump out and let others ask questions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. You talked a little bit about this in the earlier remarks, but we've been seeing a lot of headlines of state and local governments under pressure. And the thought is, is that the pressure might get worse because tax revenues lag. Can you just remind us what your exposure is to municipalities and what you think \u2013 do you think the environment will get worse over the next year or two? Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: I'll just quickly speak to and the impact of CPI, which is usually one of those pieces that can have some pressure. And that's about 35% to 40% of the revenue line. And so that is a place where we have our eye on, what we're going to do in pricing execution over the course of 2021 to overcome what may be mild pressure on that side.\nJim Fish: I would add to that. Thanks Devina. I would add to that too, if you go back the last handful of years, which I've done over and over again, and look at CPI and our core price performance, you can see that they're not \u2013 there's a disaggregation there, and that's been strategic. We've talked about moving away from a traditional CPI to other rate setting mechanisms. And I think that's what you see. And as evidenced by what we're doing in residential and with some of the municipal customers in our landfills, that core price performance shows that we're moving further and further away from CPI because it's frankly not a rate setting mechanism that aligns as well as some others when it comes to the cost of our business.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That's helpful. And just one quick follow-up, you mentioned the synergy targets with ADS in excess of $100 million. Can you just remind us the timing on that? Is that something you think you'll have fully done by the end of next year? Or is it going to take a little bit of time?\nJohn Morris: Well, clearly originally we talked about it going through 2021 and into 2022, and that was before maybe the delay. So the short answer is we won't get it all in 2021, we feel like we've got great integration plans. The teams hit the ground running on Friday. Things are going exceptionally smooth. I looked at our \u2013 talk to our team this morning and customers are getting serviced. So we feel very pleased about where we sit. And I think we're going to make a lot of ground up in 2021. We won't get it all though.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Appreciate that. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey guys, thanks. Playing a little bit of clean up here near the end, so I got a few questions just to clarify some things we've been hearing. Devina, I get that we can't get a profit guidance yet because of the integration challenges. Can you tell us what the two months of revenue would be in the fourth quarter for ADS and then what the rollover is in the 2021?\nJim Fish: We figured that most of your questions have been asked. So yes, we win.\nMichael Hoffman: Well, I'm playing a cleanup, so I've got to come back to some of the stuff that's been discussed and get some clarity. Devina, on advance I get, we don't have EBITDA. As you need to get through some budgeting and what have you, but can you tell us what two months of revenues would be in 4Q and what the rollover would be in the 2021?\nDevina Rankin: So the rollover is an interesting question, two months, we're looking at about $275 million of revenue on a gross basis; on a divested basis, we're in the ballpark of $225 million, but it's really hard for us to know for sure. On a rollover basis, you would just extend that off of the 10 months, but we're not yet speaking to expectations for yield and volume for their business because we're still in the planning processes.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. So if I just took that's 225 divided by two and then multiply it by 10, that's what I should rollover?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. But we have yet to assess the intercompany impacts. So if you think about the integration of the sites that are in markets, where we will now take ADS volume into a Waste Management landfill, we don't know those impacts to the net revenue of the business.\nMichael Hoffman: Fair enough. Fair enough. Do you still planning on spending $40 million on the ERP this year?\nDevina Rankin: So we have \u2013 today that number is in the ballpark of $25 million, I believe. And we are on pace, the reason the number is lower than we had initially expected. It's not because we slowed anything down, it's actually, because we saw some ability to reduce our costs with T&E on the third-party support that we had. And so we have a lower cost in the current year. We do, at this point, expect to spend more in the coming year on acceleration of our work efforts both on the HR side and the finance side.\nMichael Hoffman: Perfect. And then cash flow from ops is going to be about $100 million better than your 2Q revision of the numbers. How much of that's working capital versus you're running the business better, it's profit.\nDevina Rankin: When we looked at it, the cash flow from ops pieces, I would say, you kind of split it down the middle. You've got lift in operating EBITDA above expected levels, and that's both on the revenue side and the margin side. And then the remainder of it has to do with the cash collections taking hold that I mentioned earlier, we had projected an $80 million to $100 million headwind from DSO in the year. And we now have worked pretty hard to offset almost all of that. Though, at this point, we're projecting that we get that to a moderated level of say a headwind of $20 million to $40 million.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. That's great. And then just to be clear, your incremental margins before we entered, we\u2019re kind of like 40% around collection and in the 60s in disposal. And what your message is, as you've proved that you can permanently lift the incremental margin?\nDevina Rankin: That's right. I think that when we look at the incremental margin of the business, while the traditional returns from a margin perspective on LOB perspective are important, but what's equally important is our ability to get leverage on the cost side. And what you've seen strong execution on in 2020 is that getting the most expensive work hour out of the day and getting the most expensive mile off the road. And so both on the labor and maintenance front, we've seen really strong leverage. And that really does benefit us both on collection and disposal. John mentioned in his prepared remarks, disposal overtime hours being down, approaching 30%, so really strong results on the cost side, give us really a lot of confidence that we're going to have better incremental margins on the volume returns.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then Jim, you shared that you thought if the states get to full reopening by the middle of the year, a trend, is this an appropriate way to think about cadence without getting into numbers? First quarter\u2019s negative volume, 2Q is positive, they even each other out. Second half is positive, the year is positive.\nJim Fish: I'm not sure I said, they even each other out. I mean, look, do you remember that a little bit of first quarter of 2020 was impacted not a lot but certainly two or three weeks of the first quarter was impacted. And then obviously, second quarter was a huge impact. So I wouldn't say they would even each other out, we haven't fully determined what our volume is going to look like for 2021 yet, but just based on what you were saying there, I think first quarter is going to be \u2013 certainly going to be less impacted than second quarter. So the year-over-year comp might be difficult in Q1. But we do have that second half of March that is an easy comp. And then obviously, you have a very easy comp when you get to Q2 and then Q3.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then if you added back in your environmental fee number, the $42 million, is the right way \u2013 and that's because you gave back these and did things like that. I think if I understand correctly, and your yield would have been like 3.4% in the quarter. Am I interpreted that correctly?\nJim Fish: I'm not sure we've done the math there, but look, there was \u2013 there were a lot of gifts to our customers for all the right reasons in Q2 and Q3. And that's why we've said we are confident in our ability to capture price going forward.\nMichael Hoffman: Right, last one for me, you talk about people first. Talk about the COVID fatigue and how that sort of is managed through as a business, given the essential service aspect of this and the day-to-day sort of presence of this.\nJohn Morris: So, Michael, I would tell you, listen, the vast majority, you mentioned essential workers. The vast majority of our folks have never gone home. And we have \u2013 are certainly following all of the safety protocols as they ebbed and flowed. And I think the proof is, is that when you look at where some of our employees have been affected by and large, it's not been from inside the workplace, it\u2019s been from outside the workplace. So the protocols we've put in place have clearly been helped to prevent any spread within our districts. I would say in terms of fatigue, I certainly think in the beginning, there was a lot more unknown than there is today. I think with all the assistance we've provided to the field, I think the field would tell you now that we're operating a little bit of a new normal, but as evidenced by turnover, Devina mentioned morale operating \u2013 I mean, when you look at all of this, it would suggest that our teams continues to perform really well and not really be fatigued if you will. I know it is certainly a stress on everybody, but I think our teams done an excellent job of managing through it. The leadership has done a great job at the field level and here in Houston have managing through it. So I would tell you, it's the new normal for now until we get a solution for this.\nJim Fish: Well, we provide, Michael, a lot, in addition to financial support for all of our teammates, we provide a lot through our HR group, we provide emotional support for employees. And then certainly we've seen an increased demand for that year-over-year. I think it's though \u2013 it's been amazing how our teams performed under these circumstances. And I do believe that by taking that financial, that big financial worry off the table for them, that has helped them emotionally as well. So but yes, you're right. I mean, we talked about the term people first all the time, and it is at the top of our list.\nMichael Hoffman: Very good. Thank you very much.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Michael.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nMichael Feniger: Hey everyone. Thanks for squeezing me in. Devina, you mentioned how CPI, if 30%, 35% of your business could be mild pressure in 2021. The good news is you guys are talking about the momentum really in commercial and industrial. Do you usually implement like 50%, 60%, 70% of that book of PIs for 2021. Does it usually happen in Q4 and early 2021? And as Jim mentioned, some pockets of weakness, like education, entertainment, hospitality, how do we think about the ability to implement some PIs with some of your fragile customers? Is it more of \u2013 I'm sure it's not a one size fits all. So is there a percentage of your book that you guys are looking at and that's more of a wait and see as the recovery broadens out?\nDevina Rankin: I'll speak to the first part. So our annual PIs for that part of our business are typically in July and October. And so really wasn't much of an impact in 2020, in terms of our deferred price increases because we defer those beginning in April and continued that through June. So our PI activity was normal course of business, beginning in July with the exception of the items that Jim mentioned. So when we think about the year ahead, that's when you can start to see those pressures take hold, and then with that, I'll turn the rest over to John.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Michael, I would say, I think you said it well as we've got some pockets that Jim referenced, lodging, some parts of education, travel, et cetera, restaurants that are still in some form of business slow down, if you will. And I think that's right. I mean, Jim said, what we did in Q2 is not necessarily what we're going to repeat, but I think going forward that is a case-by-case basis on understanding what's going on with each of those customers, no segments and making the appropriate long-term decision.\nMichael Feniger: That's really helpful. Have you guys \u2013 is there a rough estimate of how we should think about that page? You guys have such a diverse customer base, but like you just said, lodging, travel, education, maybe restaurants, is there kind of percentage that we can say this is kind of the pocket of risk while the other businesses are obviously moving in the right direction?\nJim Fish: I think Michael, part of why this industry is such a great investment for shareholders is because we are so diversified that one sector going down doesn't really have a dramatic impact on us. So now obviously in April and May, when you had multiple, the entire economy going down, it was going to have an impact on us. But even then, you're still talking about a certain percentage of the economy being essential services and we provide service to them. So I think when we look at that piece that has lagged, it's probably, I mean, we talked about schools being 8% to 10% of our commercial business. And those have come back in many cases and in most cases, maybe not fully, some have come back fully. Some are coming back on a hybrid basis. The sports teams are trying, as we saw last night on the football game, the Pennsylvania teams have been at zero fans, look like last night, they had 7,500 fans. It was probably good for that game, but it's coming back slowly, but the beauty of this industry is that we represent all sectors of the economy, and many of those sectors are deemed essential and have been there since March. And those that are not essential are recovering reasonably quickly, some less than others. But we feel confident that as we showed in our volume numbers, that 2021 will be the eventual emergence of all of these businesses.\nMichael Feniger: That makes sense. And I might have missed this. You guys clearly performed very well in the third quarter. And I think you said ADS did too. Are there going to be financials on ADSW since they were standalone entity for the months of Q3? And how should we think about, you guys wants this very lengthy long DOJ process, some commercial customers are a little fragile right now. Can you go out and reprice the ADSW book right away, or is it kind of have to be a wait and see and take it quarter-by-quarter?\nDevina Rankin: So with respect to whether or not you'll see a full set of ADS financials for the third quarter, the quick answer to that is no. What I would say is that when we give guidance in 2021 related to the combined business, we'll give a lot of transparency and color about the pieces of the puzzle that get to the combined outlook.\nMichael Feniger: Got it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Neville with Scotiabank. Your line is now open.\nMark Neville: Hi, good morning. First, great quarter and congrats on getting ADS done.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nMark Neville: This perhaps my first question just around the costs conversation and the structural improvement, I'm just curious, as long as you come back and again, presumably some costs come back, but the steps that you\u2019ve taken through the pandemic and sort of what you've done. Has all that been sort of fully optimized or is there still sort of cost improvement to come in the coming quarters from the actions that you've taken to maybe partially offset some of that costs come back?\nJim Fish: Yes, I mean, certainly when \u2013 as volumes continue to return, there's some incremental costs, but I think is what you've seen from us through Q2. And then in Q3, we've been able to certainly overcome that. And we've expanded margins the way we have and that's in light of us losing volume in our highest margin business. So the natural thought would be as that business starts to come back, we continue to keep a close eye on cost control, both in the operating side and on the SG&A side that we've got some more runway there.\nDevina Rankin: I think the additional leverage that you see is the continued execution on optimal work week, continued execution on maintenance, service delivery optimization, and then the cost reductions that we should get in the overall structure, whether it be back office or front-line, as a result of the technology investments that we're making taking hold. Now, Jim spoke fully to the fact that those will take some time, but we do expect to see those begin to take hold in 2021. And there's additional leverage from all of those initiatives combined.\nMark Neville: Okay. Maybe just a question on price. Again, I appreciate there's parts of the business that are still feeling some pressure, but again, there's other parts of your business where you're taking some sort of structural actions around this full length of price. I guess, my question just would be, maybe not the quantum but more in terms of the length of time or in the visibility that you have around price or the strength in price just from some of the structural actions that you're taking?\nJim Fish: I think your question might be related to and in some ways related to what we're doing with our differentiation efforts. And so we believe that there's \u2013 not only is there this price strength that we've shown, which is in large part intended to recover cost increases, and at the same time expand margin. But there's also a piece of that now going forward, which we really haven't tapped into yet, that's really related to a differentiated service offering. And when you're differentiated, you can charge more for your services and your customers are willing to accept that because they truly view you as being differentiated. That's really what we hope to get out of customer service digitalization, and we are very much in the early innings there.\nMark Neville: Okay. And then maybe just one last one then on the synergy, $100 million target, Devina, you mentioned that the $40 million of savings is from refinancing the debt. When you talked about confident in exceeding $100, is that sort of driven by that? Or is it again, I guess, the $100 million on the operations?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. No, just to clarify, if I misspoke, the $40 million is incremental to the $100 million. The $100 million is from operating and SG&A as well as CapEx execution.\nMark Neville: Right. So when you talk about exceeding the $100 million that's again, aside from the $40 million?\nDevina Rankin: That's correct.\nMark Neville: All right. Okay. I'll probably leave it there, but again thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to our presenters.\nJim Fish: Well, thank you. In closing today, I'd like to recognize three of our areas that have had to contend with natural disaster after natural disaster. And in doing so, they've done it with amazing patience and professionalism. First off, our Gulf Coast area took a direct hit from three separate hurricanes this year. And many of our teammates were displaced from their homes and several of our facilities incurred pretty significant damage. But through all of that, they've persevered and they've gotten the job done, which was amazing in and of itself. And similarly, our Northern and Southern California areas have really almost had to come to accept that wildfires are just a devastating normal these days. We've had wildfires the last several years and certainly including last year, and then again this year, but the team hasn't wavered, they've provided outstanding service and really demonstrated that a love for their customers and their communities. In fact, you may have heard about the story of one of our drivers who literally saved the life of an elderly woman in Paradise, California, last year. So to those three areas, Northern California, Southern California, and Gulf Coast, they should be committed for the jobs that they've done through this really unfortunate series of natural disasters. Thank you to all of you. God bless you. And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning. And we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to open the call by welcoming the employees and customers of Advanced Disposal to the Waste Management family. We closed the acquisition last week, and we're excited about the opportunity ahead to create value from this deal. We're also pleased with a concurrent close with GFL Environmental on the divestiture package. I'd like to give credit to Richard Burke and the Advanced Disposal team for the great job they did, staying focused on operating their business safely and efficiently during the extended closed period. The next phase of our journey, the hard work of combining these two great companies has now begun. John will speak a bit more on this topic, but suffice it to say, we're very confident in the long-term value of the acquisition. And the integration is off to a great start. We're extremely pleased with our third quarter results, which were a testament, both to our team's ability to optimize our business in a new environment, as well as the progress of the economic recovery in North America. We've consistently pointed to operating EBITDA as the best measure of the health of our business. And despite the challenging backdrop, we delivered third quarter operating EBITDA results in line with last year's record performance and expanded operating EBITDA margin by 70 basis points. It's been said many times that great companies are able to emerge from tough times stronger than they were going in. In that vein, WM has learned this year that we can permanently operate our business with a lower cost structure. Despite a 2.7% decline in our third quarter revenues, the team was able to improve operating expense as a percent of revenue by 110 basis points and hold SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue relatively flat. This is the second consecutive quarter where we've demonstrated this flexibility in a difficult operating environment. And we're committed to holding on to operating efficiencies and cost savings as our volumes turn positive again. In addition to proactively changing the cost structure of our business, we're taking steps that propel us forward as a stronger, more differentiated company in the eyes of our customers. As I discussed last quarter, our investments in customer service digitalization or CSD are unquestionably the right approach. And we've accelerated these investments to reap the benefits sooner. So far this year, we've made considerable progress on this effort that will fundamentally transform our business model by offering our customers greater choice in how to interact with us and by seamlessly connecting the front-end customer experience to our back-end processes. And we've started to see the benefits. Our online sales channel is our fastest growing sales channel. And we've seen an increase in our conversion rates for customers that signing up for new service when visiting our e-commerce site. We've also made progress in automating a variety of operational back office and customer communication processes, which are paving the way for efficiency gains, improved customer experience and further cost reduction. To support our CSD journey, we modified our field sales structure to expand online and inside sales functions, while reducing and optimizing outside sales coverage. These adjustments are part of our long-term vision to position our team to engage with customers on the customer's terms, improving customer satisfaction and engagement. It also enables us to reduce our costs of new customer acquisition and improve sales performance at a more efficient cost. We're confident that these strategic sales coverage adjustments coupled with our visual growth strategy, better support our customers as well as the long-term growth of the business. Recycling continues to show the improved results that we expected when we started to change the business model, providing stronger financial results in the third quarter. In addition to our new highly automated MRF in Chicago, we've opened a similar facility in Salt Lake City, with another to open soon in Raleigh. Using advanced technology in our recycling facilities is the blueprint for improving our cost structure, producing a higher quality material and being flexible to changing recycling end-market demands. Recycling is only the beginning of our commitment to sustainability. Last month, we published our 2020 sustainability report, building value together. The report describes how we are addressing challenges and opportunities related to ESG and doing so in close partnership with our customers, suppliers, and communities. Through the crisis of 2020, we've remained steadfast in our commitments to protecting the environment and contributing to a circular economy. WM is a leading voice in the call to create domestic end-market demand for recycled content. One of the ways we're walking the talk is our collaboration with Cascade Cart Solutions to develop and purchase residential carts made with post-consumer resin. Another way is our investment in continuous materials, a company which develops building materials from hard to recycle paper and plastics. Increasing the value of the material that we process, increases the economic benefits from recycling which drives volumes and benefits the environment. The shift in our operating model, along with benefits from the acquisition of ADS and our progress in transforming the recycling business positions for a strong finish to the year with positive momentum heading into 2021. We've performed exceptionally well despite the difficulties presented with COVID-19. Our results in the first nine months of the year, give us confidence. We can generate free cash flow in excess of $2 billion exclusive of ADS transaction costs. As we also achieved the highest operating EBITDA margin in the company's history in the third quarter, we're confident we can exceed the high end of our guidance for full year operating EBITDA margin of 28% to 28.5%. After all we've been through this year, what's most impressive is we expect to finish 2020 within a stone's throw of our all-time high 2019 operating EBITDA. For that I'm eternally grateful to our teammates who have made it happen this year in the face of difficult circumstances. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Good morning, Tyler. Thanks, Tyler. It's a good question because, there was \u2013 there were a lot of moving parts in the second quarter and we talked about the fact that we were supporting our small business customers in the second quarter, and that would all be reflected in price, whether it was the free month of service or whether it was deferred price increases, all that would show up on the price line. So we knew that Q2 was going to be artificially low, and Q3 had a piece of that in there as well. So we're confident that the pricing will remain a core strength for us in Q4 and beyond, whether it is commercial or roll off or more recently John's focus and our focus as a team on residential pricing and landfill pricing. Those are all going to be strengths of ours. It's a little bit of the last question about margin in addition to cost controls that we're confident in, we're also equally confident in our price capabilities. Yes. I would just change one word in Devina's sentence, if we look at Biden win, we will \u2013 regarding environmental regulation, it is interesting for us that \u2013 first off, all of our focus is not necessarily on the federal elections, we tend to focus on state elections too, because the state has such an important place, such an important role for us, and that carries over to environmental regulation. But as it relates to the federal elections tomorrow, we've said that regulation is actually in a strange way, a good thing for WM, because we hold ourselves to a very high regulatory standard, environmental standard. And so any additional regulation actually tends to work in our favor. So to the extent that, that comes out of tomorrow's election, that could be a good thing for us. I think there is a bit of a lag here, Hamzah. We have accelerated the spend as we mentioned \u2013 Devina mentioned and it's impacting SG&A costs. And we felt like this was the right year to do it. This \u2013 I think I read somewhere that 77% of companies have done the same thing, have accelerated their digital spend. If \u2013 just to kind of put it in \u2013 to be specific about what it's impacting though and what it's impacted so far. Things like customer setup is being impacted, routing and dispatch, service confirmation, billing, inquiries, all of those make up the pie of calls, that come into our call centers. And the idea is that we'll give that option at least to our customers to be able to self service. And then behind the scenes there will be a real significant streamlining of really all of those processes. Today there is a lot of steps involved, there is a lot of data entry involved, ideally we get to a point where you greatly reduce the amount of data entry, which reduces the amount of potential for error. And then in turn reduces the confusion, sometimes that results from those errors when a customer calls in. I would tell you that we're \u2013 if I use kind of a baseball analogy here, that we're probably in inning three here, as it relates to this full customer service digitalization, and that will take us all the way through 2021 to fully develop. But we are moving quickly on it and we're encouraged by what we're seeing, not just on those process changes, but also on the front-end of that, which is where the customer sees it. As I mentioned in my script, we're seeing \u2013 our increases are coming in that e-commerce channel. So we're excited about this, and we think this has the real potential to separate us from the pack even more significantly going forward, It's interesting Hamzah, we've \u2013 I've read a couple of reports that have talked about volume being different in the urban settings versus rural. I would tell you, this is not an urban versus a rural, the impact of COVID is not been urban versus rural. What it's really been is almost state-by-state and province by province. So the States that seem to be doing the best and are closest to full recovery happened to be those States that opened up most quickly. So those are States like Texas, like Florida, like Arizona, Georgia, those States are doing best when we look at our own data on the States that are lagging are States like Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York, and then provinces like Ontario and Quebec. Those have been most stringent on reopening and are the farthest behind. I would tell you here in Texas, it's full steam ahead, we've been going out to restaurants for a number of months now, at least in our family and we're outs both nights this weekend, and it is full steam ahead here. The businesses that tend to be lagging, the sectors are still hospitality, still sports, entertainment, schools to some degree and then the related small businesses there that touch those sectors. But overall, I would tell you that I think we are seeing a full reopening, I think what we're seeing is that people are just saying they can't be shut down forever, they have to \u2013 their businesses, particularly small businesses that is there. That's the way they put food on the table. And so I don't expect those small businesses to continue to be shut down forever. And when will these States fully reopened? I don't know. Some of that depends on the extent of COVID and the pursuit of a vaccine, but if I had to guess, if you pressed me on it, I would say mid-to-late 2021, you'll see most of these States and provinces be reopened. Thanks, Hamzah. Yes. I don't think we would approach things differently. That doesn't mean we're going to come back out with another free month of service for small customers. And to the extent that States lockdown, I mean, there has been a bit of an ebb and flow there with some States. But again the States that have at least from an economic standpoint have done the best in this recovery are those States that have been pretty consistent about staying open and then trying to put protocols in place to protect against spikes in COVID. And those are States like Texas and like Arizona and Florida and Georgia. So I think we would handle it the same way. And \u2013 but going forward, I don't anticipate offering another deferral of price increases or another free month of service to small businesses. Well, two questions there, and I'm going to let John take the second one about ADS. The first one related to sustainability. It's a fair question. We don't necessarily see any capital creep related to our focus on sustainability. Look, we've been focused on sustainability, it's not something we've been focused on for two quarters, it's something we've been focused on for probably 10 years, but more specifically for the last five years. And we managed through that and to the extent there is any capital needs, it just gets built into our budget. Yes. Thanks, Kyle. Thank you. Good morning, Walter. We think it will be relatively flat. I think it's such a difficult question, because of how States manage their reaction to somebody spikes in COVID. We're sitting here in Texas and I think Texas, whether you talk about the Mayor here in Houston or the Governor. I think Texas actually \u2013 we went through our own spike back in July and part of August, and the State managed its way, the city of Houston managed its way through that quite well. So we didn't re-shut down as we were in April and May, we just put stronger protocols in place and we're more \u2013 we were tougher on those who were offending, but we did not go back and shut down businesses. Now that's not my decision, that's the decision of the Governor of Texas and the Mayors of these cities. But I think Texas is a pretty good indicator of how to handle it without crushing businesses, but also making sure that we're keenly aware of the danger of spike in COVID. I don't know whether some of these other States will handle it the same way. So as a consequence, we're projecting relatively flat volume in Q4. I think Hamzah asked earlier, and I didn't really answer the question, how we're looking in October. And just as I said with the quarter, October is looking pretty similar to what September look like. So relatively flat, a few things are lower, a few things are higher. But overall, we expect that the volume will be flat from Q3 to Q4. Well, okay. We've said \u2013 John said in his scripts and he can add color here. But what \u2013 really are the big takeaway for us in \u2013 particularly in Q3, but also to a lesser extent in Q2 was that we now believe, we can truly operate this business at a lower operating cost structure. Devina also talked about SG&A. And so in all the obvious areas, things like travel and some of the discretionary spend, we know that we can run at SG&A that's lower than previously thought. But most importantly, when we look at what John discussed in his prepared remarks, we absolutely believe that as we climb back to volume break even and then start to accelerate again, that we've learned that we can operate at a operating cost structure. There are \u2013 as you mentioned, there are some things that will impact our operation such as traffic. But when I look at \u2013 I use Houston a lot because I sit here, but I look at charts for Houston traffic every week, put out by a group here in \u2013 of the greater Houston partnership. And Houston traffic is almost back to pre-COVID levels. When you look at the city of Houston for us, we are still looking similar to the rest of our business in terms of overtime. So it gives me confidence that while traffic will certainly create some snarls in our operations, that we'll be able to hang on to these efficiency gains that we're picking up. And then to add to that what we're doing with digitalization. And I believe that's why we firmly believe that this is a long-term sustainable approach to it, a new approach to our operations. John, anything to add on. You bet. Hi, Sean. So I think your question was largely around special waste and projects there. And so what we're seeing with special waste and to some degree C&D. C&D is a bit cloudy, the picture is cloudy because of last year and the fire volume from last year. And as John mentioned, if you normalize for that, it's maybe 7% down year-over-year, as opposed to 19% down. But primarily with special waste, what we're seeing is that these large companies that own these special waste projects, that there's some discretion in the timing of the initiation of those projects. So our pipeline looks quite good at this point. And the big question is when will they initiate those projects? Many of them as you might expect, have been delayed in 2020. And we expect that they will build those projects into their budgets for 2021, after this unpredictability goes away from 2020. I would add to that. Thanks Devina. I would add to that too, if you go back the last handful of years, which I've done over and over again, and look at CPI and our core price performance, you can see that they're not \u2013 there's a disaggregation there, and that's been strategic. We've talked about moving away from a traditional CPI to other rate setting mechanisms. And I think that's what you see. And as evidenced by what we're doing in residential and with some of the municipal customers in our landfills, that core price performance shows that we're moving further and further away from CPI because it's frankly not a rate setting mechanism that aligns as well as some others when it comes to the cost of our business. We figured that most of your questions have been asked. So yes, we win. I'm not sure I said, they even each other out. I mean, look, do you remember that a little bit of first quarter of 2020 was impacted not a lot but certainly two or three weeks of the first quarter was impacted. And then obviously, second quarter was a huge impact. So I wouldn't say they would even each other out, we haven't fully determined what our volume is going to look like for 2021 yet, but just based on what you were saying there, I think first quarter is going to be \u2013 certainly going to be less impacted than second quarter. So the year-over-year comp might be difficult in Q1. But we do have that second half of March that is an easy comp. And then obviously, you have a very easy comp when you get to Q2 and then Q3. I'm not sure we've done the math there, but look, there was \u2013 there were a lot of gifts to our customers for all the right reasons in Q2 and Q3. And that's why we've said we are confident in our ability to capture price going forward. Well, we provide, Michael, a lot, in addition to financial support for all of our teammates, we provide a lot through our HR group, we provide emotional support for employees. And then certainly we've seen an increased demand for that year-over-year. I think it's though \u2013 it's been amazing how our teams performed under these circumstances. And I do believe that by taking that financial, that big financial worry off the table for them, that has helped them emotionally as well. So but yes, you're right. I mean, we talked about the term people first all the time, and it is at the top of our list. Thanks, Michael. I think Michael, part of why this industry is such a great investment for shareholders is because we are so diversified that one sector going down doesn't really have a dramatic impact on us. So now obviously in April and May, when you had multiple, the entire economy going down, it was going to have an impact on us. But even then, you're still talking about a certain percentage of the economy being essential services and we provide service to them. So I think when we look at that piece that has lagged, it's probably, I mean, we talked about schools being 8% to 10% of our commercial business. And those have come back in many cases and in most cases, maybe not fully, some have come back fully. Some are coming back on a hybrid basis. The sports teams are trying, as we saw last night on the football game, the Pennsylvania teams have been at zero fans, look like last night, they had 7,500 fans. It was probably good for that game, but it's coming back slowly, but the beauty of this industry is that we represent all sectors of the economy, and many of those sectors are deemed essential and have been there since March. And those that are not essential are recovering reasonably quickly, some less than others. But we feel confident that as we showed in our volume numbers, that 2021 will be the eventual emergence of all of these businesses. Thank you. Yes, I mean, certainly when \u2013 as volumes continue to return, there's some incremental costs, but I think is what you've seen from us through Q2. And then in Q3, we've been able to certainly overcome that. And we've expanded margins the way we have and that's in light of us losing volume in our highest margin business. So the natural thought would be as that business starts to come back, we continue to keep a close eye on cost control, both in the operating side and on the SG&A side that we've got some more runway there. I think your question might be related to and in some ways related to what we're doing with our differentiation efforts. And so we believe that there's \u2013 not only is there this price strength that we've shown, which is in large part intended to recover cost increases, and at the same time expand margin. But there's also a piece of that now going forward, which we really haven't tapped into yet, that's really related to a differentiated service offering. And when you're differentiated, you can charge more for your services and your customers are willing to accept that because they truly view you as being differentiated. That's really what we hope to get out of customer service digitalization, and we are very much in the early innings there. Thank you. Well, thank you. In closing today, I'd like to recognize three of our areas that have had to contend with natural disaster after natural disaster. And in doing so, they've done it with amazing patience and professionalism. First off, our Gulf Coast area took a direct hit from three separate hurricanes this year. And many of our teammates were displaced from their homes and several of our facilities incurred pretty significant damage. But through all of that, they've persevered and they've gotten the job done, which was amazing in and of itself. And similarly, our Northern and Southern California areas have really almost had to come to accept that wildfires are just a devastating normal these days. We've had wildfires the last several years and certainly including last year, and then again this year, but the team hasn't wavered, they've provided outstanding service and really demonstrated that a love for their customers and their communities. In fact, you may have heard about the story of one of our drivers who literally saved the life of an elderly woman in Paradise, California, last year. So to those three areas, Northern California, Southern California, and Gulf Coast, they should be committed for the jobs that they've done through this really unfortunate series of natural disasters. Thank you to all of you. God bless you. And thank you to all of you for joining us this morning. And we will talk to you next quarter."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. As Jim and John have discussed, our third quarter 2020 results have demonstrated both the strong foundation provided by our essential services and resilient business model and the value created from the hard work of our team who are delivering each day in an increasingly cost-effective way. When we look at our third quarter operating and financial results, as John just said, virtually every metric exceeded the expectations we set just three months ago. Volumes have come back stronger than expected. We have flexed operating costs to drive improved margins, and that's far better than our targeted efforts to keep them flat. And we've seen improved customer account collection trends take hold. All of this positions us to finish the year strong with organic revenue down in the range of 3.25% to 3.75% versus the 4% to 5% we projected in July, targeted operating EBITDA margin of more than 28.5% and free cash flow in excess of $2 billion. With revenues down about 2.7% from the prior year quarter, our operating EBITDA was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. This strong result, underpinned net cash flow from operations, which was $1.29 billion, an increase of 8% compared to the same quarter last year. Over the course of the third quarter, we saw strong recovery in our customer collections and day sales outstanding, lessening the expected headwind from working capital. Additionally, our operating cash flow for the quarter includes the deferral of payroll tax payments under the CARES act, which provided a benefit of about $40 million. We continue to expect the full year benefit of payroll tax deferral to be $120 million. Third quarter capital spending was $343 million, a $140 million decrease from the same quarter in 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we took prudent steps to reduce and defer certain aspects of our capital spending until we had better visibility into the pace of volume recovery. The majority of the targeted reductions were the results of adjustments and landfill cell construction schedules and a decrease in the purchase of steel containers. We expect full year capital expenditures to be between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Our business generated free cash flow of $691 million in the third quarter, through the first nine months of the year free cash flow was 1.432 billion, a conversion of cash from operating EBITDA of [Technical Difficulty]. And as I just mentioned for the full year, we expect our strong operating performance, effective management of working capital and disciplined capital spending to yield free cash flow an excess of $2 billion, excluding the impacts of ADS. Our strong free cash flow positions as to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the third quarter, we paid $230 million in dividends. We remain fully committed to our dividend program, solid balance sheet and balanced allocation of remaining available cash to strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. With the recent closing and funding of the ADS acquisition, our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong and we are well positioned to continue our practices of sound investment and strong shareholder returns. We financed the $4.6 billion acquisition of ADS net of the $856 million in proceeds from the divestiture to GFL Environmental with a combination of our credit facilities and commercial paper. We continue to look for the right window to access the capital markets for long-term financing alternatives. Current and forecasted leverage ratios are well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facilities, and we expect to quickly return to our targeted total debt to EBITDA of 2.5 to 3 times. Turning to SG&A costs. There is no doubt that the lessons we're taking to heart from the pandemic have extended to SG&A as well. While third quarter SG&A was slightly above prior year at $389 million, that increases due to an accrual for long-term incentive compensation, as well as an intentional acceleration in technology and investments that Jim mentioned earlier. Absent these two items, our SG&A would have been down nearly $30 million from the third quarter of 2019, demonstrating our collective commitment to reduce discretionary spending. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.1% despite the revenue decline in the quarter. And we continue to target SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 10%. Before turning the call over for questions, I want to provide an overview of our planned approach to updating financial guidance post ADS. With the close of the acquisition just behind us, the entire team is focused on welcoming ADS employees and serving our new customers. Each company produced outstanding third quarter results and we are confident that we will finish 2020 strong, as a collective team. Our integration plans are robust and as John just mentioned, we're confident that we can achieve planned synergies. This is an integrated business model and for that reason developing estimates for the cost associated with routes from a partially divested hauling district can be difficult. We are well underway in analyzing and evaluating our financial plans for the year ahead and we will clearly delineate a plan with our fourth quarter 2020 results, that speaks to the top strategic priorities of Waste Management and the integrated value of ADS. Suffice it to say, we closed 2020 excited about the road ahead and prepared to make the value of the whole greater than the sum of its parts. In closing, I want to thank our team for all they have accomplished. Our strong results are a testament to the resilience of both our people and our business model. With that, Lindsay, let's open the line for questions. Good morning. Yes. You absolutely have those buckets right. Yes, that's correct. So the $120 million that we have reduced our 2020 cash outlay will repay all \u2013 we'll have a full year in the year ahead for normal course of business and then 50% of this year's outlay. Sure. Well, I think what John just mentioned should give everyone confidence that the 28.5% year-to-date EBITDA margin that we have produced through really tough circumstances, this isn't kind of indication of what we can achieve, it's an indication of what's yet to come in terms of additional incremental value that can be created from here, while we look at EBITDA margin for the year, there are always puts and takes. I think what's important to know is that in the current year, we look at those puts and takes and say sure, it's something like health and welfare expenses that were lower and the second quarter may work against us in the year ahead. But what's more important is that the operating performance and the ability to lever down on discretionary spending. Those things are indicative of long-term value creation on the margin front, and those will far outpace that health and welfare headwinds that we have in 2021. Thank you, Tyler. I'll speak quickly to the tax impacts. When we look at Biden win the thing that is most apparent there is federal tax rates could increase from 21% currently to 28%. That's about a 6.5% increase in our effective tax rate based on our current modeling. And that would be about $150 million increase in the provision and about $125 million in cash taxes. Really hard to predict further than that, we know that bonus appreciation is something that seems to have bipartisan support. And so therefore, we expect a 100% expensing to continue through 2022 and then the phase out to continue thereafter. Aside from that, I'll let Jim speak to the impacts to the rest of the business. Yes, Hamzah. I would say we absolutely expect the acquisition to be free cash flow accretive in the year ahead. The free cash flow impacts to the fourth quarter, we're expecting that to be more like a push even potentially a little bit on the downside, because of some of the cost to achieve and starting to make investments on the capital investment side as we integrate some of our sites. So I would say fourth quarter impacts is either flat to down on the free cash flow front. And then we really start to see the benefits of full run rate of the ADS EBITDA combined with early indications of our synergy capture and a lower capital cost as well, as we refinance the required indebtedness. I think it's equally important to think about how we responded with our employees. And it goes without saying that when you look at turnover, as well as employee morale and safety results, that our response on the employee front we think was exactly what it needed to be and we would repeat those steps. Some of the costs though that we incurred, particularly for the back office, as we moved folks into work from home mode, those were one-time and we wouldn't look to see those repeat. Sure. So I'll start with just where we were from a leverage perspective immediately following the close. And that's about 3.15 times, including pro forma EBITDA. So it really does speak to the solid financial position of Waste Management. And so when we look at that number, we think that both when you combine synergy capture, as well as growth in both businesses will be quickly to our targeted leverage ratios over the course of 2021. As it relates to ADS' debt that was immediately repaid upon close and simply by taking that indebtedness and replacing it with WM's debt. We see an immediate synergy value from that in the ballpark of $40 million on a gross basis, so after tax, clearly a lower number than that. That is not something that was specifically contemplated in the $100 million of synergies. That relates to operating performance and SG&A rationalization. And we'll be executing upon those strategies over the course of the next year. As I just mentioned, when we look at 2021 and see a clear path to leverage in our targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times, we're really optimistic that we'll be able to resume share repurchases at some point in 2021. We always revisit our capital allocation plans in the fourth quarter. And we'll do that again this year with expectations for clarity on the dividend in the extent of 2021 share buyback at that time. But we will remain focused on balanced allocation to a combination of the M&A and share buyback with excess free cash flow. I'll just quickly speak to and the impact of CPI, which is usually one of those pieces that can have some pressure. And that's about 35% to 40% of the revenue line. And so that is a place where we have our eye on, what we're going to do in pricing execution over the course of 2021 to overcome what may be mild pressure on that side. So the rollover is an interesting question, two months, we're looking at about $275 million of revenue on a gross basis; on a divested basis, we're in the ballpark of $225 million, but it's really hard for us to know for sure. On a rollover basis, you would just extend that off of the 10 months, but we're not yet speaking to expectations for yield and volume for their business because we're still in the planning processes. Yes. But we have yet to assess the intercompany impacts. So if you think about the integration of the sites that are in markets, where we will now take ADS volume into a Waste Management landfill, we don't know those impacts to the net revenue of the business. So we have \u2013 today that number is in the ballpark of $25 million, I believe. And we are on pace, the reason the number is lower than we had initially expected. It's not because we slowed anything down, it's actually, because we saw some ability to reduce our costs with T&E on the third-party support that we had. And so we have a lower cost in the current year. We do, at this point, expect to spend more in the coming year on acceleration of our work efforts both on the HR side and the finance side. When we looked at it, the cash flow from ops pieces, I would say, you kind of split it down the middle. You've got lift in operating EBITDA above expected levels, and that's both on the revenue side and the margin side. And then the remainder of it has to do with the cash collections taking hold that I mentioned earlier, we had projected an $80 million to $100 million headwind from DSO in the year. And we now have worked pretty hard to offset almost all of that. Though, at this point, we're projecting that we get that to a moderated level of say a headwind of $20 million to $40 million. That's right. I think that when we look at the incremental margin of the business, while the traditional returns from a margin perspective on LOB perspective are important, but what's equally important is our ability to get leverage on the cost side. And what you've seen strong execution on in 2020 is that getting the most expensive work hour out of the day and getting the most expensive mile off the road. And so both on the labor and maintenance front, we've seen really strong leverage. And that really does benefit us both on collection and disposal. John mentioned in his prepared remarks, disposal overtime hours being down, approaching 30%, so really strong results on the cost side, give us really a lot of confidence that we're going to have better incremental margins on the volume returns. Thank you. I'll speak to the first part. So our annual PIs for that part of our business are typically in July and October. And so really wasn't much of an impact in 2020, in terms of our deferred price increases because we defer those beginning in April and continued that through June. So our PI activity was normal course of business, beginning in July with the exception of the items that Jim mentioned. So when we think about the year ahead, that's when you can start to see those pressures take hold, and then with that, I'll turn the rest over to John. So with respect to whether or not you'll see a full set of ADS financials for the third quarter, the quick answer to that is no. What I would say is that when we give guidance in 2021 related to the combined business, we'll give a lot of transparency and color about the pieces of the puzzle that get to the combined outlook. Thank you. I think the additional leverage that you see is the continued execution on optimal work week, continued execution on maintenance, service delivery optimization, and then the cost reductions that we should get in the overall structure, whether it be back office or front-line, as a result of the technology investments that we're making taking hold. Now, Jim spoke fully to the fact that those will take some time, but we do expect to see those begin to take hold in 2021. And there's additional leverage from all of those initiatives combined. Yes. No, just to clarify, if I misspoke, the $40 million is incremental to the $100 million. The $100 million is from operating and SG&A as well as CapEx execution. That's correct. Thank you."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim and good morning. Our third quarter results showcase the strong execution of our front-line team members who are safely and efficiently servicing our customers each day, as well as the resilience of our business model as we manage costs and capital expenditures in this dynamic environment. The team's hard work paid off with tremendous results as we improved operating expenses as a percentage of revenue a 110 basis points and expanded operating EBITDA margins of 70 basis points. We saw a steady volume recovery across the collection and disposal business during the third quarter, improving volumes, coupled with collection and disposal yield returning to a healthy 2.6%, generated revenue above our expectations. We were anticipating a revenue decline of 3.5% to 5.5% in the second half of the year with the majority of that decline weighted toward the third quarter, yes, the third quarter revenue only declined 2.7%. Of the commercial volume suspended due to the pandemic, almost 70% have resumed service and there is further cause for optimism in the C&I business as net new business and service increases versus service decreases were both positive and showed significant sequential improvement in the third quarter. Residential container waste continued to be elevated mid-to-high single-digits compared to last year. Recovering the cost of increased waste as part of our conversation with municipalities as we work to improve the profitability of our residential business and change the structure of residential contracts. In the residential line of business, our yield improved to 3.5% as we make progress on this effort. External volumes for the third quarter were down \u2013 external landfill volumes for the third quarter were down just over 8% with special waste volumes down about 12% and C&D volumes down about 19%, on a tough comparison in part due to wildfire cleanup last year. Without the cleanup from last year, C&D volumes declined about 7%. Landfill volumes improved sequentially each month in the quarter with total landfill volumes in September down less than 4% and C&D and special waste each down about 8%. Notably MSW volume was flat for the quarter and September volumes increased nearly 2% year-over-year, a powerful indicator of the progress of economic recovery. Moving to pricing. Third quarter core price was 3.2%, adjusted for the impact of lower volume core price would be 4.1%. As expected, pricing metrics are trending back toward pre-pandemic levels following the intentional customer focused steps we took to support our small business customers during spring shutdowns. We're confident in helping our customers during a difficult economic climate was the right step and we continue to see increased loyalty from our customers. Third quarter churn improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 8.8% and we saw another boost in our net promoter scores for all business lines we measure. In particular, our commercial business scored more than doubled, driven by higher scores for reliability, flexibility and improved online resources. Our pricing results reflect 3.3% core price in both landfill and transfer businesses as we continue the positive momentum with post collection pricing initiatives. We've been disciplined with our post collection pricing and we remain committed to staying the course. Turning to ADS. No one has been more eager than me to welcome the ADS team to Waste Management. And with the closing behind us, we're extremely confident in the value this deal will deliver. We've gotten significant clarity on the ADS business and are pleased with the recovery the business has shown as the economy has reopened. We work closely with the ADS team for many months and are hard at work on integration, giving us confidence that we will exceed $100 million synergy target, despite higher than originally expected divestitures. As Jim mentioned, 2020 has taught us we can operate our business with a much lower cost structure than we have historically. And we're holding on to operating efficiencies and cost savings as volumes return. The 110 basis point improvement in operating expense as a percentage of revenue in a third quarter is evidence of our success. When volumes began to decline in March, we aggressively flexed our routes and trucks parking more than 800 vehicles at peak declines. This lowered maintenance costs and allowed us to optimize volumes across the younger and lower cost portion of the fleet. Throughout the pandemic route reductions have outpaced volume declines in the commercial and industrial lines of business. As volumes have returned, we have been extremely disciplined in bringing back trucks into service, driving improved asset utilization and helping to keep maintenance costs low. In the third quarter, lower maintenance spending resulted in a 70 basis point improvement in operating expense as a percentage of revenue. We've also been successful in improving efficiency as each week since February, we service more yards, homes and halls per hour than in the same period in 2019. Increased efficiency was a key driver of less overtime in the quarter, while volume decreases across the collection and disposal business were in the mid single-digits, over time was down 21% in the commercial and industrial lines of business and over time was down 27% in the disposal business. The team is doing an exceptional job of managing expenses and I'm confident we are carrying forward the lessons we've learned on safely operating our business at a lower cost structure. In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team, including our new advanced disposal team members for their hard work and dedication during trying times. Third quarter results exceeded our expectations on virtually all measures as we continue to demonstrate our ability to manage our operations in an uncertain environment. I will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss her financial results in further detail. No, I think Tyler, I mean, listen, we're very pleased with what the teams have been able to do to control cost and a lot of that's been done through efficiency over time, better maintenance and repair results, et cetera. So we've taken full advantage of it, but that's not to suggest that we don't have some more opportunity within the operating expense categories. I think the second part of the question with regard to ADS, we've obviously had a good bit of time to study their capital structure in the business. And the short answer is we don't see that as a capital drag. They've been very deliberate and intentional on how they've capitalized the business and we feel comfortable that they're in a good spot as we start the integration. Yes. I mean, listen, Kyle, we've been talking about residential loan before COVID and I think if you look at the results that Jim commented on what we've done on the core price and yield side with regard to residential. I think and I said this on the last call that the additional pressure, if you will that the volumes because of people working from home, it does present another challenge and we're having those conversations with municipalities and with the franchises. What I'm really happy about is if you look at even the margins in residential now, even with what's gone on recycling and to some extent what's going on with this pandemic in the additional ways, we're still showing margin progress there. I think the conversation around the pandemic and the weights and whatnot. It seems to have leveled out and as we said kind of the mid-to-high single-digits depending on where you are in the country and that's a conversation we're going to continue to have. And it's a challenging conversation, a lot of these municipalities are facing budget constraints or whatnot, but I would tell you where we're having success is getting the price up, being paid adequately for the service we're providing. But our public sector team has really done a nice job of really partnering with these municipalities and working with them on ways where they can streamline maybe some of the service offerings, still achieve what they need for their residents and still allow us to be compensated at an inappropriate level. No. Kyle, I would tell you we're very happy with where we are on our CNG conversion. We're running right now because we've taken some trucks off the street, we're actually running close to 70% right now of our routed vehicles. And I think part of what you're seeing in our improved maintenance and repair numbers and whatnot is due to us running a younger more efficient fleet, that's the majority of which CNG. I will tell you on the other alternatives, electric vehicles in particular, we've got a number of pilots going on with different vendors. I mean, that's still a developing technology, I think for the heavy duty vehicle class that was really a focus for us, there is still a little bit of wood to chop there. And I think, when we get to the point where it's advanced, we're going to have to be very careful with who we picked in terms of the technology leader. Thank you. Good morning. The only thing our used coverage. And the only thing I'd add Walter is, we do have a lot of granular data on the density of volumes we're picking up and how that's been eroded and now come back. And to Jim's point, we're talking about 70% give or take of our C&I business coming back that was eroding yet you still see a very wide gap in the efficiency and the overtime ratio. So we're almost back to kind of a normal traffic pattern in a lot of places, and then some of that friction's return yet the operating folks are doing a great job of hanging on to the savings. Yes, Sean. That's a good question, a couple of questions in there. One is, if you \u2013 obviously, in our prepared remarks, we reiterated again, how confident we feel about exceeding to $100 million synergy target. And that's obviously in a sort of post-COVID environment. I think Richard and the team have done a really nice job in the first half of the year as evidenced by their results and their recovery especially in the geographies that they were in the 16 States that advanced was in. And as Jim mentioned in his comments, we've been comparing those recovery rates and those geographies and the advanced portfolio came back nicely. And as Devina mentioned in her comments the third quarter both companies perform really well. So if you think about \u2013 even though we're in a COVID environment, even though the divestitures were higher, we're still very confident in our synergy number as we roll into Q4 and into 2021. So the short answer to the second part is yes. I think what we've talked about as we went through Q2 and into Q3 is that those delivered concessions were going to have an impact, but we thought making a one quarter concession to those customers was the right thing to do. And honestly, from everything we've seen from the feedback from our customers around Net Promoter Score, I commented on. That it's absolutely been the right move. I think what you're seeing from Q2 to Q3, in particular in commercial and industrial where most of those concessions were made, as you saw a nice recovery. We're not all the way back up to where we were, but what we've all said throughout this pandemic when we've been chatting with you folks is that this is not a change in our strategy or our philosophy, but it was a short-term decision made to ease some of the \u2013 what was going on with our customer. So I think when you look at the bridge between Q2 and Q3, we'll see continued momentum as we go into the fourth quarter and into next year. Well, clearly originally we talked about it going through 2021 and into 2022, and that was before maybe the delay. So the short answer is we won't get it all in 2021, we feel like we've got great integration plans. The teams hit the ground running on Friday. Things are going exceptionally smooth. I looked at our \u2013 talk to our team this morning and customers are getting serviced. So we feel very pleased about where we sit. And I think we're going to make a lot of ground up in 2021. We won't get it all though. So, Michael, I would tell you, listen, the vast majority, you mentioned essential workers. The vast majority of our folks have never gone home. And we have \u2013 are certainly following all of the safety protocols as they ebbed and flowed. And I think the proof is, is that when you look at where some of our employees have been affected by and large, it's not been from inside the workplace, it's been from outside the workplace. So the protocols we've put in place have clearly been helped to prevent any spread within our districts. I would say in terms of fatigue, I certainly think in the beginning, there was a lot more unknown than there is today. I think with all the assistance we've provided to the field, I think the field would tell you now that we're operating a little bit of a new normal, but as evidenced by turnover, Devina mentioned morale operating \u2013 I mean, when you look at all of this, it would suggest that our teams continues to perform really well and not really be fatigued if you will. I know it is certainly a stress on everybody, but I think our teams done an excellent job of managing through it. The leadership has done a great job at the field level and here in Houston have managing through it. So I would tell you, it's the new normal for now until we get a solution for this. Yes, Michael, I would say, I think you said it well as we've got some pockets that Jim referenced, lodging, some parts of education, travel, et cetera, restaurants that are still in some form of business slow down, if you will. And I think that's right. I mean, Jim said, what we did in Q2 is not necessarily what we're going to repeat, but I think going forward that is a case-by-case basis on understanding what's going on with each of those customers, no segments and making the appropriate long-term decision."

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames Fish: Thanks, Ed and thank you for joining us. The strength and resilience of our business was clearly demonstrated in the second quarter as our results exceeded our expectations. At the outset of the quarter governments and businesses across the continent were responding to the pandemic with stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of broad sections of the economy resulting in sharp volume declines in our collection and disposal business. Our immediate priorities were protecting our employees and providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. With a framework in place to achieve those early priorities we then focus on optimizing our business for the new environment and we saw measurable improvements as we progressed through the quarter. Year-over-year declines in operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business improved each month of the quarter as we were able to successfully flex down our operating costs, eliminate discretionary spending and improved productivity. I am extremely proud of our team. Clearly the shutdown of the entire economy had a dramatic impact on the top line of our business. Yet even with a 10% decline in our second quarter revenues our team was able to improve operating expenses as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points, hold SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue relatively flat and most importantly deliver 10 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As we progress through the third quarter we are firmly confident in our operating model and are well-positioned to deliver on the revised expectations we have for the remainder of the year. Our second quarter results prove that putting our people first so they can take care of our customers communities and the environment is the right approach to ultimately rewarding our shareholders. Putting people first is fundamental not just to our ESG philosophy but to our business strategy. On our first quarter call, we discussed the actions we took to protect our employees\u2019 health, safety and financial well-being. We also took steps to support our customers particularly the small and medium-sized businesses that have been impacted most adversely during the COVID-19 pandemic. We helped our customers right-size their service levels, temporarily paused price increases, extended payment terms and gave a free month of service to qualifying open market small and medium business customers. While these actions had a short-term impact on our price metrics, we've strengthened our customer relationships and increased customer loyalty. Our customer churn for the second quarter was our lowest on record at 6.9%. We've also seen significant increases in our net promoter scores; a measure of customer loyalty. Overall, second quarter net promoter scores increased 82% and our commercial line of business score tripled. We are now turning our focus to the longer term to ensure that we come out of this pandemic a stronger more differentiated company. At our investor day last year we laid out our plan to continue to invest in technology to enhance our customers experience with us and increase the lifetime value of a WM customer. At that time we felt we had a strong plan to achieve some big technology wins over the next several years. However, during this pandemic several things have become abundantly clear to us. First, our customer service digitalization investment otherwise referred to as CSD is unquestionably the right approach. This end-to-end digitalization of our entire customer experience from the first customer contact to the service confirmation will be unmatched and as we've seen during COVID-19, the companies with a superior end-to-end online model will truly be differentiated in the post-COVID world. Second, it became very clear to us early in this pandemic that when we all move in unison as one organization towards the accomplishment of a goal. There is nothing we can't accomplish and accomplish quickly. No one within waste management thought we could move thousands of employees to a work from home environment in one week's time but we did it. This gave us confidence that we can be more ambitious and agile when it comes to technology advances. That's why we are now accelerating our efforts around CSD. Using the onboard units, the smart truck platform and our data analytics capabilities all of which we've discussed for several years, we will seamlessly connect all the WM functions required to service our customers, so we can give them a completely digitalized customer experience. This will put us on par with other great companies and other industries who have separated themselves through their own digitalization efforts. We'll have more details as we roll this out but we expect to see some early wins this year. And finally we're excited about the milestone we reached on the advanced disposal acquisition last month. At the end of June we announced a revised agreement with ADS. Additionally, earlier this week we and ADS entered into an agreement to an amendment to the previously announced agreement with GFL environmental and GFL is now contracted to purchase all anticipated regulatory divestitures for $863.5 million. We expect both transactions to close by the end of the third quarter of 2020 once we receive regulatory approval and the approval of the ADS shareholders. With all the additional work we've done since the deal was announced in April of 2019 we're confident in our projection to achieve more than $100 million in synergies even though divestitures are greater than we originally expected. We are looking forward to completing this transaction, integrating the ADS team and operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders as we add 3 million additional customers to our platform and service capabilities. Turning to our full year outlook, our second quarter results combined with the early stages of economic recovery provided greater clarity for our 2020 financial results. This has allowed us to again provide full year guidance based on current economic conditions and before the contribution from ADS. We now expect a revenue decline of between 4% and 5% when compared to 2019, adjusted operating EBITDA margin in the range of 28% and 28.5% and free cash flow approaching $2 billion; again completely exclusive of the impact from ADS. Our impressive cost flexing in the second quarter combined with the recovery from the reopening of North America both of which we anticipate will carry into the back half of the year mitigates what certainly would have been a more significant impact from the pandemic. In closing, despite the challenging backdrop we're confident in our ability to continue to meet our commitments to our customers and deliver solid 2020 results. During these unprecedented times our business model has once again proven its resilience and we remain focused on using this opportunity and our technology investments to create a differentiated customer experience that puts our customers at the center of everything we do to increase workplace flexibility for our people. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim and good morning everybody. Our team has remained focused on the fundamentals of providing safe, reliable and efficient service to our customers despite the challenging backdrop. Our focus on execution paid off in the second quarter as we improved efficiency across the commercial, industrial and residential lines of business. By calibrating our cost to the current volume environment we achieved total company operating EBITDA of 28.8%, a 10 basis point improvement over 2019. The volume recovery trend we are seeing is encouraging. Volume declines in the collection and disposal business improved throughout the second quarter. Through the first few weeks of July we've seen further volume improvements despite certain areas of the country slowing their plans to reopen. We've adopted a proactive approach to service restoration and to-date we have resumed service for more than half of the commercial and industrial volumes that were suspended with the March shutdowns. While we are seeing some markets recover faster than others we are encouraged that commercial businesses, the backbone of the U.S., economy are showing strong signs of recovery. While residential container weights have declined from their peak increases they are still elevated by mid single digits when compared to last year. This strengthens our case with municipalities as we work to improve the profitability of our residential business and change the structure of residential contracts. It'll take some time to reshape this business but we are making headway. Turning landfill volume, external volumes for the quarter were down a little more than [18%] or around 13% if you adjust for natural disaster volumes in 2019 similar to what we experienced with our collection volumes our landfill volumes improved throughout the quarter with June being the best month down 11% compared to June of 2019 adjusted for work days and natural disasters. Looking specifically at MSW volume which tends to be the most resilient and a good indicator of trends particularly during a recovery the quarter was downright at 9 % while June improved to a 3.5% decline. Moving to pricing, we have taken intentional customer focus steps to help our small business customers in this tough economic climate which we believe will generate long-term customer loyalty and we're already seeing signs of it in our numbers. As Jim mentioned our net promoter score has increased. We took these steps knowing that there would be downward pressure on pricing metrics in the second quarter but we see these consequences as short term as we stay disciplined in executing our pricing programs. Second quarter core price was 1.3%. This includes almost 3% core price in the landfill business and 3.1% in the transfer business as we continue the positive momentum with post-collection pricing initiatives. We remain committed to the pricing discipline we have worked hard to instill to cover our rising costs and protect our margins. In July court prices started to trend back toward pre-pandemic levels. Our impressive cost pricing drove the solid results for the quarter. We improved operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. The team increased efficiency across all collection lines of business along with significantly decreasing overtime hours, reducing routes and optimizing the fleet. Overtime costs decreased 30% in the collection line of business in the second quarter driven by reductions in the commercial and industrial businesses. With regard to maintenance, our focus on asset utilization for our fleet is yielding results. We reduced downtime by 23% the second quarter achieving 99% fleet availability. Year-to-date the improvement in downtime hours has resulted in $5 million of savings. We're also flexing down our post-collection operating costs by reducing variable expenses such as overtime and heavy equipment operating hours. Second quarter overtime costs decreased by 39% across the landfill, transfer and recycling businesses. The team has done a good job of managing costs through this pandemic and we expect that to continue through the second half of 2020. And lastly, let me briefly touch on recycling. The good news that in the second quarter we continue the trend of approving operating EBITDA for the business. For the quarter we improve the bottom line by nearly $8 million driven by a stronger blended commodity rate of $57 ton; our focus on operating expenses and continued progress toward a fee for service model. We remain confident that our strategy for recycling including our recent investment in MRF technology in Chicago is pushing our recycling business toward operational, environmental and economic sustainability. So overall our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as we demonstrated our ability to proactively manage our operations in uncertain times. I am extremely proud of the hard work of the men and women on the front lines who were instrumental in flexing costs down while continuing to provide high quality service to our customers. And with that I will now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our second quarter financial results and full year outlook.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks John and good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter financial results which reflect the resilience of our business model, the strong execution of our front line team members who safely and efficiently serve our customers and communities each day and the solid proactive steps our team has taken to manage costs and capital expenditures in this dynamic environment. Our strong performance in the second quarter positioned us to deliver on our top financial priorities of strong adjusted EBITDA margins and robust net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. As we started to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on our business several months ago we quickly focused on the EBITDA margin impacts that revenue declines in our highest margin industrial, commercial and landfill lines of business might have on our near-term results. We initially estimated that 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins could be impacted by as much as 100 basis points. In the second quarter of 2020 which we expect to have the toughest revenue comparisons of the year we managed costs to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin that meaningfully exceeded those initial expectations. With the benefit of this strong performance in our economic outlook we now expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% or flat to down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Our strong adjusted EBITDA result is the largest single contributor to our cash flow results in the second quarter. Our net cash flow from operations was $856 million or about 24% of revenue in the quarter. As we saw at the end of March there is pressure on working capital from slowdown in customer receipts which we attribute to customers taking steps to protect their own financial positions. We are taking proactive steps to work with our customers to ensure that these pressures on working capital are managed and balances are collected for services provided. In spite of these efforts, we expect that a delay in the timing of cash receipts from customers could create an $80 million to $100 million headwind in the working capital contributions to free cash flow in 2020. Our operating cash flow for the quarter also reflects the impact of the deferral of payroll tax payments as provided for by the CARES Act. This deferral benefited our current quarter cash flow by about $40 million and we expect the full year benefit to be $125 million. Second quarter capital spending was $436 million, $142 million lower than the second quarter of 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we have decreased our capital spending to align with the current economic outlook. The majority of the targeted reductions were the result of adjustments in landfill cell construction schedules and a decrease in the purchase of steel containers. We will not reduce the amount of capital allocated to our fleet in 2020 but are considering the current volume environment as we finalize our planning for truck builds and deliveries in 2021. At the beginning of the second quarter we targeted a 10% decrease in capital spending from the initial range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion for 2020. The team has worked hard to execute on this plan for focused and disciplined reductions in capital expenditures and in spite of the volume recovery that's tracking above our prior expectations and our plan to accelerate the pace of CSD we expect to deliver on this goal and have revised our 2020 outlook for full-year capital expenditures to between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion. In the second quarter of 2020 our business generated $423 million of free cash flow. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 our cash conversion was in the low 40% range an increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the full year, we expect our solid operating performance and disciplined capital spending to yield free cash flow approaching $2 billion excluding the impacts of ADS. As a reminder when we originally established our 2020 free cash flow outlook we excluded impacts of ADS including advisory and integration planning costs from the target. We plan to provide a more complete view of the free cash flow impacts of the acquisition post close. Through June 30th our operating cash flow and free cash flow included $45 million paid for integration planning efforts. Our strong free cash flow positions us to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we pay $230 million in dividends. We remain fully committed to our dividend program, a strong balance sheet that provides certainty through any economic cycle and balanced allocation of remaining available cash to strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. In the near term, as we further develop our outlook for volume recoveries and position ourselves for a successful close of the ADS acquisition, we will continue to conserve cash and focus on a modest deleveraging towards our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times total debt to EBITDA. Turning to SG&A costs. Second quarter SG&A was $353 million, a decrease of $32 million compared to the same period last year. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 9.9% despite the significant revenue decline in the quarter. These results include lower incentive compensation accruals as well as the steps we have taken to reduce discretionary spending in response to business impacts related to COVID-19. Even as the business environment begins to improve we're maintaining extreme discipline and evaluating our ongoing level of spending for non-essential costs such as consulting, travel and entertainment. Our cost management actions were partially offset by an increase in our bad debt expense of $12 million in the quarter. In light of the trend we have seen in our receivables and the acceleration of CSD which will increase SG&A spending in the back half of the year, we expect full year adjusted SG&A to be slightly higher than 10% of revenue. We're confident we're on the right path with CSD to continue to differentiate our service and provide long-term value to our customers and shareholders. Finally, our strong balance sheet and liquidity position us well for the current economic environment as well as funding the acquisition of ADS. Current and forecasted post-acquisition leverage ratios are well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facilities and we have more than $3 billion of available capacity under our primary revolving credit facility. Additionally, this week we closed on a $3 billion, 364 day revolving credit facility that positions us to immediately fund the transaction it closed and then look for the right window to access the capital markets for long-term financing alternatives. Our solid financial results this quarter demonstrate both the resiliency of our business and the success we are having in dynamically managing our costs. I want to thank the entire Waste management team for their hard work which allows us to deliver on our commitments to our customers, communities and shareholders. With that Marianne let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire, Goldman Sachs. \nJames Fish: Good morning Brian.\nJohn Morris: Good morning.\nUnidentified Analyst: Good morning. This is [indiscernible] for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. Appreciate the color and the details you provided so far on the exit rate volumes for 2Q and how things were looking in June and it sounds like things maybe are still sequentially improving through the first two weeks of July but just something maybe if you could quantify any of those numbers and amongst the different lines of business if you could.\nJames Fish: Sure I mean we are to your point seeing July continue to accelerate albeit at a slightly slower pace. I mean look at this kind of went from zero to not 70 miles an hour but probably zero to 60 miles an hour pretty fast and now we're moving back towards 70 miles an hour. The one area that John focused on was really MSW that has really been impressive. The second area that's and we're down 3.5% in MSW. The other one that was surprising to us because we expressed some concern about it in the first quarter was commercial and at its low point the commercial line of business was down as much as 15% even more in some areas and that has returned to down kind of 5% or 6%. So it's really rebounded and it continues now through July to show improvement. The one that kind of is starting to jump a bit right now that's good for us is special waste. It had been down even through June it had been down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis and when I looked at the rolling week numbers which compared to prior year just yesterday those numbers are starting to really show improvement in special ways. So we're now actually up double digits there in special waste where we have been down deep in the double digits previously. So we are pleased with the progress we're showing on virtually all of our waste streams and our collection lines of business.\nUnidentified Analyst: I appreciate those details. Certainly it's encouraging. And then maybe if I could just get just the updated guidance for the year for 2020 with the revenues expected to be down 4% to 5%, just hoping maybe if you could help us better understand kind of the moving parts there. Does that basically assume that pricing yields or holds flat from 2Q levels for the rest of the year and maybe just the moving parts between pricing yield and volume and what your expectations are there? Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. It's a great question. We're not specifically giving outlook for the back half of the year on the price and volume components but what I would say Jim just gave tremendous color with regard to the improving volume outlook and I think that coupled with the fact that the Q2 execution on pricing was intentional and focused on being customer-centric and so we certainly expect an improving result in the back half of the year on price. So you can expect that the yield component gets back to closer to normal levels or outlook for 2020 and an improving volume trend. When we look at the back half specifically we're projecting that you have a decline in revenue of in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% and that's more significant in Q3 and then tapers in Q4 to about half the Q3 levels what we're projecting. I do want to point out particularly given what we're seeing in the market today that fuel prices did have a 2% impact on the revenue line in Q2; difficult to predict that specifically. We weren't predicting any added pressure on the top line from fuel in the back half of the year but that's certainly out of our control and not necessarily representative of the strong execution of the business which we're really encouraged to see the momentum that we saw at the end of Q2 and beginning into Q3.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. I appreciate all the details. Thanks. Good looking quarter.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin, RBC Capital Markets.\nJames Fish: Hi Walter.\nJohn Morris: Good morning.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. So I'd like to start with margins obviously you've guided two impressive cost control doing much better than what you had thought you would be able to do which is great. Just curious on the structural nature of this when volumes start to come back can we see operating leverage such that you can maintain and you alluded to a better organization or a strong organization post-COVID. Does that mean you can run and you expect to run at margins above historical trends once advanced disposal is integrated or would you see that when volumes come back resources would have to come back as well and get you back to more normalized kind of historical levels?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, Walter I will start this one. I think it's a really interesting question rather than specific on post ADS margin, I am going to focus really on WM based business because we're going to wait to give any financial outlook for the integration of ADS until post-closed but when we think about the strong margin execution in the second quarter, I mean hats off to our operators and the front line for doing a tremendous job and I think what you saw in those results is that we got the most expensive hour out of the route and we got the most expensive truck off of the street and so through efficiency, through improved maintenance, improved downtime there were really fundamental tremendous improvements in the operating nature of the business and those are things that the team is working hard to see how we hold on to in a post-COVID environment with improvement in volume outlook in commercial and industrial collection. I do think the residential collection margin impacts that we've talked about we're focused more on the price side of that equation to be sure that we recover the increase in our cost to serve but looking for efficiency in that part of the business as well. In terms of the strong execution in Q2 and how we think about that for the remainder of the year, I think the improving volume trends and price, price is really an important piece of that because we delivered this margin result in spite of having lower contributions from core price which we see really flow all the way through on margin. So particularly impressive when you consider that aspect. There are certain elements of the cost structure that increase in the back half of the year as an example fuel tax credits were something that we got a benefit for in the fourth quarter of 2019 instead of that being a second half of the year phenomenon this year those are spread, those benefits are spread over the course of the year. So that has some margin pressure in the back half as does the increased acceleration of spend on CSD which Jim spoke about. So really strong execution in operations and we expect that to continue particularly with the improving volume backdrop.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. That's great and encouraging as well. So moving on to price I know you just alluded to it. Can you speak to what happened with core price as you mentioned you did not get the benefit of core price and what is the risk and how does it work that, you implied here that it is going to come back. Does that just come back because of the overall macro environment and easier to drive forward or is there something more detailed to that in addition to what you had mentioned with regards to residential and recapturing some of those higher volume through higher pricing.\nJames Fish: Yes. I mean I think there's a couple of points to make here with respect to price and maybe the first one would be to your last point there I mean there is this price discipline that we've talked about this morning that remains. We certainly haven't lost any price discipline but we felt like that it was absolutely the right approach to take during the quarter to pause on these price increases and some fees and also to really help small business emerge out of this by giving them a free month of service. I mean I can't imagine if I were a small business owner sitting in my living room opening my mail and getting my big price increase from waste management. I mean that would not have gone over well with me as a small business owner. So it was unquestionably the right approach to take in Q2 and honestly into Q3 that will persist to a to a lesser degree because some of these small businesses have not reopened and what we told them with respect to the free month of service was that we would give you a free month of service once you reopen. So I'm sitting in downtown Houston and there are a lot of small businesses that have not opened in the central business district here. I suspect it's the same in other big cities. So we will still see some of that weakness in pricing but point that I think Devina was really touching on was that when you think about price discipline and once we get past this short-term [COVID] effect, the price discipline is still there. John talked about it too in terms of landfills and transfer. That is something that is truly ingrained in our culture and so we don't kind of kick that to the curb when COVID goes away that becomes immediately reestablished but there was of course in Q2 a big impact from this more kind of sympathetic approach to these customers and we'll see some of that in Q3 as well.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. Makes a lot of sense. Appreciate the time as always. Thanks.\nJames Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman, KeyBanc Capital.\nJames Fish: Hi Sean. \nSean Eastman: Thanks for taking my questions. So compliments on a good second quarter performance here. I just wanted to drill in on the second half. I mean, I am just trying to understand where you see the big swing factors in the second half \u201820. So visibility clearly improved around the volumes but I am just curious where you think some conservatism is still warranted in that second half outlook and just maybe where you guys don't want to get over your skis just yet as we think about trajectory here from a revenue margin perspective in the second half.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, Sean I will start that and then I think the others can add some color. I think the place that we start that discussion is on the top line and as I mentioned the outlook for the back half of the year is currently revenues being down 3.5% to 5.5%. When you look at how we finish June and see July coming together we do think that there is some potential for optimism in the top line results for the back half of the year but it's appropriate for us to be reserved and going too far in terms of how quickly we start to see the recovery certainly with the number of case increases that have been seen across the southern part of the United States and so that's really where that back half question mark starts but we feel really good that 4% to 5% is representative of how we'll finish the year. In terms of the cost part of the equation it really does come down to the operating cost leverage as the biggest driver. There are certain elements of cost over time being one of them which John spoke a lot about in terms of our ability to flex the number of overtime hours. That translated into $45 million dollars of operating cost savings in the second quarter and that's a tremendous result but ensuring that as we see volumes grow back and whether it be the efficiency part of the business, increased traffic on the roads, thinking about how we manage the work day that $45 million of savings is something that we have our eye on. Other elements of the labor line which is the biggest single component of our cost structure is really where we're focused. The pieces that are in SG&A we have at hand. I would tell you that the results that you saw in the second quarter we're confident that we can continue to deliver. As I mentioned, the increased investment in CSD in the back half of the year means that those costs will increase but that's an intentional investment for the long-term growth and customer-centric nature of our business.\nJames Fish: Yes and one quick thing and I think John wants to touch on OpEx too but Sean, when you think about the conversation we just had about price, obviously it was uniquely soft. I mean -- but that softness dissipates over the next quarter or two back to much more of a normalized level of price increases and where we've been prior to COVID. So that certainly is upside for us but we knew the downside was going to be there and it was the right thing to do and then of course volume which we talked about earlier early on in this call and we think that volume while it has started to slow from the really steep increase that we saw in June it still is increasing and I talked about special waste showing some really nice improvement and then MSW and commercial industrial has lagged a little bit It showed a nice pick up but we are seeing some differences by geography and it's interesting when you look at the kind of the southern part of our network versus the northern part of our network, the northern part of our network whether it was the U.S. or Canada tended to shut down a bit more quickly and reopen a little later and so we think there is some real opportunity. I was in Boston a couple of weeks ago and honestly Boston for the first time since COVID really started -- is starting to feel open. I mean we were in restaurants eating inside and so those businesses are starting to reopen and so while  Boston and our New England area is still down relative to some of the areas in the south that will provide more of a kind of a spike upturn in volume for markets like New England, New Jersey, New York, those Pennsylvania.\nJohn Morris: Sean, the only thing I would add to your point about getting over our skis, I think when you look at and as Jim mentioned we're looking at this literally on a daily basis by region by line of business is making sure that we continue to hold tight on the reins in terms of adding costs back and I think when you look at some of the numbers we all referenced in our prepared remarks and even as late as yesterday looking at the ratio volume coming back and what we're still able to do on the cost side specifically over time as Devina mentioned that's the area where we are absolutely focused and I will tell you the ratios of volumes coming back versus overtime is still favorable. I think that's why when you think about us having the margins we had in Q2 compared to where we lost the volume which was really landfill, commercial and industrial for the team to hold those margins and there is puts and takes Devina mentioned some of them is really impressive but I think getting out over our skis that we are absolutely focused on making sure we keep the reins very tight on OpEx as we watch this volume shift.\nSean Eastman: Got it. Super helpful. Next one for me hopefully a little quicker, could you help bridge us from the down 100 basis points year-over-year margin outlook you provided on the 1Q call to the revised flat to down 50 basis points? Just any granularity between the volume recovery, cost control in that bridge would be appreciated.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. I don't know that I can get super granular for you but what I would tell you is you've hit on two of the primary factors. So volume recovery outpaced our expectations and so that certainly had some upside impact on the margin decremental impact that we had originally predicted and then cost control particularly on the operating line was even better than expected based on what we know the margins of these lines of business to be. I mentioned over time specifically health and welfare costs are another example where we saw some value to the results from a granularity perspective I guess what I would tell you is that health and welfare by itself as an example is just one of those cost categories that's difficult to predict but it had a marked contribution and around 25 to 50 basis points is what we see as a benefit for the year in health and welfare costs alone.\nSean Eastman: Appreciate it. Very helpful. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari, Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Good morning. Thank you. My first question is just around the election. If U.S. tax reform goes away, is that a $300 million headwind to you. I guess, pre-tax reform, the free cash flow base I think was close to 1.7 billion then it went to 2 billion. There was a big step change and then you also have bonus depreciation potentially going away too. So maybe if you could frame for us how to think about that potential tax headwind clearly we don't know what will happen with the election.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. I think Hamzah that last point is really the most important one for us and rather than get too granular in terms of specifically measuring what we think tax reform could do. I think we all know that we went from a 35% rate to 22% and so that dramatic change in the tax rate to ongoing business that's going to have consequences the bonus depreciation that you mentioned could have consequences but just none of us are going to be able to predict the outcome of the election or then any follow-on impacts to tax policy should there be a change in a significant shift in and who's in office. So I think you've framed it well. I think all of the pieces that you mentioned are the ones that we are paying attention to and the level of impact to cash is something that is significant and therefore we'll have a close eye on that but not trying to predict it at this point.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Understood and then just on customer churn was pretty good. Traditionally, half of customer churn for the sector has been bankruptcies and so with stimulus running out, I appreciate your guided revenue growth down 4% to 5% but do you think that we're out of the words on commercial? Specifically do you think that small business bankruptcies are going to be a potential risk as you think about your revenue growth over the next 12, 13 months? Anything you're hearing from your customers or I realize you don't have a crystal ball but so any comments you can make high level would be appreciated.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Hamzah, this is John. So we've mentioned in early on when we were in the Q1 and the early innings of this that we were seeing cancellations just under 1%. We're seeing that numbers crept up to about 2.5, a little bit north of that but it's leveled out there. So we're not seeing big numbers in terms of cancellations. What we have seen what we talked about is obviously folks turning off their service or pausing their service and then gradually turning it back on. I think the one number we can center around is whether it's commercial or industrial we are over 50% recovered in terms of units and honestly if you look at commercial we all know education is a fairly good size chunk of our of the portfolio there and with the uncertainty there are actually our commercial recovery is over 60% if you net out the education facilities which we all know is kind of a moving target at this point.\nHamzah Mazari: Good. Got it. Lastly I'll turn it over just on the ADSW transaction, synergy is over $100 million on a smaller revenue base maybe you could just frame for us where you're seeing the upside come from and the $100 million does not include revenue synergies correct? Thank you.\nJames Fish: That's correct. What I would tell you Hamzah is obviously this process particularly around COVID is taking a little bit longer and I guess the silver lining is it's afforded us the opportunity to do that much more work and we have that much more confidence in our integration plans and it's given us the opportunity to look more closely at a granular level not just about kind of the normal SG&A corporate overhead synergies but really get in a little bit further into the details and have that much more confidence in what we're going to be able to execute against in the field and that's really what's driving that number.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, Hamzah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle White, Deutsche Bank.\nKyle White: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to some of the regional differences that you briefly touched on. Is it possible to describe how the recovery has progressed and some of the states that were first reopened and now are seeing a bit of rising COVID cases states such as Florida, Georgia or Texas. Have you seen any stalling in the recovery in these states? Any service declines in recent weeks?\nJames Fish: So it's an interesting question that we expected to be asked today. When I look at our commercial line of business and I look at those states that you just mentioned so the big four kind of in terms of spike, case spike have been Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Florida and so when I look at three of those are our best three in terms of year-over-year comparisons. Our best three in terms of year-over-year comparisons right now are Texas, Georgia and Arizona. Those are the best three out of 17 areas. Those are the top three in terms of commercial yards year-over-year comparison. So I would tell you that the spike and when you walk around Houston what's happening is that everybody's wearing a mask but businesses have not all of a sudden gone back to April or May. They're staying open but people are just more diligent about wearing masks and we're starting to see those cases level off. I heard Scott Godley last week on a business council called Talk About the fact that you're starting to see it particularly in Arizona, Texas those cases level off. So our business is actually quite strong there and as I said just a few minutes ago where we've seen a little bit of a lag are in those areas that that closed pretty quickly and then have stayed closed the longest such as New England, such as kind of the greater mid-Atlantic area, Pennsylvania but those are also starting to show some rebounds as well particularly as they start to move where some of these other states already are which is a reopening of businesses just with kind of a mask rule in place. So we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing with respect to commercial reopenings. It's the one thing that probably stood out to us the most because we were least certain about it when we discussed it at the end of Q1.\nKyle White: That's very helpful. I wanted to also go back to the pricing discussion a bit and just I'm curious if you could talk about the competitive environment and pricing behavior especially among some of the smaller players. Anything notably different recently as a result of the kind of volume impact that some of these players may be experiencing?\nJames Fish: I mean look, we haven't seen anything over the last couple of months but I really can only speak to our own price discipline and I would tell you as I said earlier that we haven't lost an ounce of price discipline. What you've seen in terms of price erosion if you want to call it that was intentional and that we will recover. It's just we're getting ourselves to get through this hopefully this short-term impact from COVID.\nKyle White: Sounds good. I'll leave there. Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown, Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Hey good morning everyone.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey Devina, I hate to beat on the pricing optics here but can you isolate the revenue dollar impact that the price increase in fee suspensions had in the quarter?\nDevina Rankin: We hadn't specifically quantified that. I mean, I think the best way to think about it is the delta between the yields that we reported and the 2.5% guide that we would have given for the year and I think that delta is pretty representative of what you could say that the price impact was for the quarter.\nTyler Brown: Okay. So not only, yes. Sorry go ahead.\nJohn Morris: I was just going to say the only thing, this is John, I would add is if you look at landfill and transfer station I would point you to that in terms of the where we've remained disciplined, I mean so the impact has really been commercial and industrial but the other lines of business we continue to show [white] performance.\nTyler Brown: Right. So not only was there a dollar contribution that was unusually low but and correct me if I'm wrong here but you also had a bit of a denominator problem. I mean your volumes were down 10%. So I'm guessing that was also a driver in the pricing optics. So I mean just to be I mean I know there's been a lot of talk about this but to be just crystal clear there has not been a change in your fundamental pricing strategy?\nJohn Morris: Not at all.\nJohn Morris: Absolutely not.\nTyler Brown: Okay. And then John, so I appreciate the resi container weight comments and I know we talked about this last quarter but what is the level of urgency around resi pricing specifically? I know you talked that it will take time but if I take a walk back in history, didn't you guys meaningfully move resi pricing? I think it was around the financial crisis if I recall. So can this be a material driver in \u201821?\nJohn Morris: Listen Tyler. I mean, we've talked about the added weights and the pressure that's put on the line of business. Here's what I can tell you is that, the additional weights that have come via this pandemic are certainly another discussion point we need to have with some of those residential customers but we started this program before that. Now I can't speak to what happened back the financial crisis. I'll trust you on that one I'm sure we probably had some efforts at the time. What I can tell you is that and Jim has mentioned this a few times we've seen obviously a lot of pressure on the residential line of business. We've seen margin erosion. My plan with the team and we have this down to the contract by region, by area to execute against long before this pandemic started. I will tell you what this pandemic has certainly helped us with is when you talk about further moving that line of business to automation containerizing being able to capture the waste, being able to price and get paid for the services including disposal that you provide for this is certainly an opportunity to highlight that.\nTyler Brown: Right. Okay. Yes. No, that's fantastic and then just my last one here Devina. So I know 2021 seems like it's a long way away but will the CARES Act represent call it an idiosyncratic headwind to cash flow next year? Is that something that we need to start contemplating?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, that's definitely something that we've got our eye on. The $125 million that I talked about for the CARES Act deferral, payroll taxes that's something that hits us in 2021 because you effectively have a doubling of that obligation in the year ahead but I think that, yes it's half of next year, half in 2021 and then another half in 2022. What I think is really important though is that the flow through impacts, the really strong revenue acceleration that you should start to see in 2021 as some of the COVID-19 volume impacts and those pricing policy decisions that we made in the second quarter, we anniversary those. I think the flow through of that to cash flow should help us to offset that year-over-year headwind but you're exactly right Tyler.\nJames Fish: There is also somewhat of a corollary there on to the CARES Act with working capital on DSO. I mean we're obviously seeing an impact this year and that's not unexpected at all or not surprising at all. So you'd like to think that as we get into 2021 that DSO starts to normalize.\nTyler Brown: Right. Okay. No, that's very helpful. Thanks guys. \nDevina Rankin: Yes, thank you Tyler.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Manthey, Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Building on a previous comment last quarter you detailed the weekly upward trajectory of your roll off business as sort of evidence of the improvement you were starting to see and based on your comments I assumed that trend continued but in the geographies like there in Texas or here in Florida where the COVID cases have worsened, are you seeing actual declines in any lines of business or were you indicating you're just seeing a leveling off in the pace of recovery?\nA - James Fish: Yes. It's really the latter. We're not seeing declines in any line of business. We're seeing as I mentioned a nice increase in special waste some of that's through our couple of combustion residual projects but not seeing declines anywhere. It's just by geography, it's a leveling a little bit where we saw big big spikes up in June and it's starting to accelerate a little bit in some of those places that were slower to reopen.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you and last quarter you said that 10% of your commercial customers had a change in service and less than 1% canceled. Could you give us an update on those data points for the second quarter or in the same ballpark?\nJames Fish: Yes. I mentioned earlier that the 1% number crept up to about 2.5% and is leveled off. There is a little higher than that to be exact but what we've seen is that is and those are the customers that have been impacted and identified as having a COVID impact. So 2.5%, 2.6%, I think is about right where we leveled off at in terms of cancellations.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you very much. \nJames Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye, Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. To start with Jim, you mentioned I think expecting to see I think you said some early wins from the CSD effort as you engage in an investment development but what types of customers do you expect are likely to value those offerings more any way to dimension out as well what you think this could contribute to organic growth?\nJames Fish: Yes. I think there's going to be in the near term more of a cost impacts, bottom line impact and then more of a topline impacts longer term as we truly kind of differentiate ourselves and by the way it's why we kind of chose to accelerate is we have talked about, we talked about it in investor day last year. So this isn't a strategy that's unfamiliar to you. It's just one that we've chosen to accelerate for a couple of reasons. One is that we really felt like we learned that when we do accelerate something we can make it happen quickly for all as I said my script all in unison behind it. So I do think there will be some changes in how our customer does business with us and that will impact us a bit on the cost side and then over time we think that really starts to separate us from the pack.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. Thanks Jim and then just go back to the residential line of business, John I appreciate your commentary round levers for both pricing and technology investment but since you have got it's very granular plant, can you just maybe share with us the target or [indiscernible] profitability improvement in the residential line of business?\nDevina Rankin: I think what Jim has mentioned and Devina in another calls is that we have been sub 10% from an EBIT line and clearly getting well above that is the direction we are going to go. I certainly see opportunities to get into the high teens or 20% over time and we're making some headway and to be real specific I probably when Tyler asked the question. When I looked at even for Q2 with the elevated weights we still on the same store sales comparison made margin improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2. So we feel really confident about that plan and I think the granularity is going to helpful for us as we look at the investment opportunities at residential line of business going forward to make sure we're deploying the dollars the right way and I've said on other calls we don't want to do it for practice. We're going to make sure you get the right returns, the right margins and the right protections in those agreements and in some cases we are going to have to make some tough decisions. We are fully going to do that.\nNoah Kaye: Perfect. Thanks. I will turn it over.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Silber, BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: Thanks so much. [indiscernible] I will ask just a couple of quick ones. You talk a little bit about pricing from a competitor's perspective. I'm just wondering are you seeing any smaller haulers close or under pressure that might provide some M&A tuck-in opportunity?\nJohn Morris: I don't know that I have seen or I haven't heard of any that of closed. I have heard of some places where they're running short on drivers. So that's not necessarily a great indication for them and that and I can't tell you whether that is a longer term trend which we've talked a lot about previously that Gen Z and millennials don't want to drive trucks and so therefore there's this pressure on the pool. I don't know whether that's it or whether it is or what the pressures are coming from but I have heard that. I have not heard though of any closures.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay. That's very interesting on the drivers. One number you'll talk about much is internalization. I know it picks up the last couple quarters. Is that because we're seeing less third-party disposal coming in or are you truly disposing more of your own collected waste? Thanks.\nJohn Morris: It's probably a bit of both Jeff, this is John. I think at the table was up about 200 basis points given 180 basis points for the quarter, 190 year-to-date might have the inverted but almost 200 basis points. So clearly when we're seeing some volume pressure at the landfill we're always reevaluating what's the best use of our network and those landfill assets. So without having a number in front of me it's probably a combination of both some third-party volumes that went out in Q2 and our decision to backfill some of those volumes where it made sense for us.\nJeffrey Silber: Okay. That's really helpful. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman, Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you Jim, Devina and John for the questions. Hope all of you and your families are well.\nJames Fish: Thanks Michael.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: So I am going to ask the question different way Devina. Your original guidance was 2.5 for the year yield. You did two in the first quarter. If you hadn't have the pandemic what was the budget for a second quarter yield? And is that \u2013\nDevina Rankin: Yes. We don't necessarily budget. We don't necessarily budget Michael our yield quarter-to-quarter. We certainly have that 2.5%. You saw some of the early impacts on the Q1 results that you just mentioned from COVID-19 because there were some early steps on fees as an example to proactively engage with the customers in the right way given what we were seeing. I would tell you we've tried to estimate where we think the yield number ends up coming in for 2020 and it's just a really difficult number because of the impact of units on the measure. So what we focus more on is that core price execution and we expect healthy recovery in core price execution in the back half of the year.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. John, on recycling if the trend holds there's $80 million year-over-year gain in revenue in that business. But what I'm thinking about the 4% to 5% down revenue, I got to account for that and then there is a follow-on question about fuel. I got to account for to sort of think about the down revenue?\nJohn Morris: Well, I think Michael certainly there was a bit of a tailwind in Q2 with fiber prices specifically OCC going up but as you probably know we've already seen that retract back and while we had a good quarter in Q2 I would tell you just a little bit under half of that was driven by price the rest of it was really Brent and team doing a great job on managing operating expenses in SG&A and other ancillary costs. So that's what drove the other half of that improvement. So we're not, we still think recycling is going to be a tailwind in the back half of the year, not as big though because that revenue number is not going to hold through the balance of the year. We don't think.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then could you share with us what your fuel, average fuel cost was in 2Q, \u201820 versus \u201819 and then what it was in 3Q, \u201819 so we can try and accurately model that we can move that much.\nDevina Rankin: I can get you those specifics after the call Michael but what I would tell you is the fuel impact to the quarter was $60 million to the revenue line.\nMichael Hoffman: In 2Q?\nDevina Rankin: Yes.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then just the point of clarification on the synergies just to be clear it's a free cash flow number and it's a mixture of OpEx saving, interest expense savings, capital spending. We presume the interest expense number is up because rates are down versus the expectation and then there's some incremental gains we gathered in the OpEx or CapEx that's the way to think about the pieces. That's what I understand by it.\nJames Fish: I would tell you Michael that obviously when we recut the deal which was really a month ago obviously there's a reduced purchase price. There is higher synergies that we commented on despite over $100 more million of divestitures and certainly there's going to be a lower cost to the CapEx but I will let Devina speak to the financing piece.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. I think what's really important Michael is that the $100 million in the confidence in the more than $100 million of synergies is not reflecting our savings in the interest line. The savings in the interest line is what we were thinking about in terms of the returns on disinvestment getting over our hurdle rate and cost of capital. It's early for us to be able to speak to specifically how much of an interest savings there might be but certainly when we look at the requirement to redeem the bonds and on a weighted average basis those were above 3.6% and if you compare that to current interest rates there certainly is some value to be had there. It's just too early for us to say. We are really excited to be in a position to be able to fund the transaction at close but this will be a phased process for us and we can't yet tell you what the long-term financing might look like.\nMichael Hoffman: Fair enough. And then a mechanical question on the [vtoes] on the 25th assume DOJ gets that, so there's a consent order not far behind that or about the same time. What happens after that? Do you close it right away or is there, is this like dry and clean clothes at the end of September but just mechanically what are we looking at?\nJohn Morris: I mean, I am not sure I know the answer to that. I mean because there is a number of pieces here involved but well what we did say was that this would be the end of Q3 which basically means sometime between the August 25 and September 30 which is a pretty narrow window and it's hard though to say well we want to do it on a certain date because we just don't have enough certainty to say what we're going to do it at the end of a month or at the end of a quarter. That's not our objective. Our objective is to work through with the DOJ and of course with ADS and get this final.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you, Michael.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning, Michael.\nMichael Feniger: Good morning. I will try to keep it short. Jim, I know you guys have moved away from CPI over the years. Can you just remind us on the CPI exposure? I understand you're driving at the residential level and different contracts but I'm just curious with the CPI? How much of that in your control really in the next 6 to 12 months?\nJohn Morris: Well, Michael it's John. I would tell you that if you look at our pricing performance regardless of what CPI has done over the last quarters, handful of years, we've moved further and further away from that I think the example he gave is probably the best one which is historically the residential or franchise pieces of the business have been tied to CPI or some fraction of that and I think our ability to drive 3% core price in residential especially in this quarter is evidence that we're moving further and further away from that.\nMichael Feniger: Got it and just like help me understand like when we talked about the top line, you guys provided a lot of color on Q3 versus Q4. How should we think of the business as we kind of like exit 2020 with the first half ? What we think is your mix of your businesses is when residential right now being your highest yield? How does that kind of impact the overall profitability going forward?\nJames Fish: Well, it's a bit of a hard question because there is a lot in the mix here. I mean it is interesting though because in terms of a true kind of year-over-year comparative basis whether you're looking at EBITDA or whether you're looking at revenue or whatever you're looking at, I honestly don't think we get to a fair apples-to-apples year-over-year comparison until the first quarter \u201822 because I think \u201920. Obviously, \u201820 is disadvantaged and then \u201821 will be greatly advantaged versus prior year. So what we're kind of looking at is when do we get to a true positive comparison versus 2019 and I think that probably happens sometime maybe as early as Q2 of next year, probably won't be Q1 but certainly Q2 looks like it could happen or Q2 or Q3 is when I think we truly get to a positive comparison versus the same quarter in 2019 and then to your question about what pieces are going to be moving in the right direction we've talked about a whole lot of along the call this morning definitely residential John talked about kind of sub-10% EBITDA margins and a lot of work being applied to that. CPI is not representative really of our cost structure anymore and so starting to move municipalities away from that price metric for us, some of which John's talked a lot about I would tell you this is kind of all in John's court but start starting to institutionalize some of the changes that we've seen on the operations side and maybe the same is true for SG&A. There is some expense that we just don't need. We don't need to have as much travel expenses as we thought we did. The Teams product that we use a lot the Microsoft product is a very-very good product and so I think that'll be a replacement for that and then as we think about some of these wins that we've discussed with customer service digitalization that will start to really have positive impact on us. So there's a whole lot of pieces here that go into this but we think by the time we get to 2021 kind of mid-2021 we're going to start seeing some positive comparisons to that 2019 period.\nMichael Feniger: Understood. I will leave it there. Thanks Jim.\nJames Fish: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang, CIBC. Please go ahead.\nKevin Chiang: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just one quick one for me. I noticed that you changed your methodology for core price and that did result in a revision to your Q1 numbers. I was wondering it was this purely a methodology change or did this brings to light any untapped opportunities that you might not have been harvesting before in terms of pricing opportunities as you look ahead here and as volumes continue to recover?\nDevina Rankin: This was purely a measurement change and we had actually made the decision in the fourth quarter and then just made an error in reporting our Q1 with everyone in the work from home mode and forgot that we had made the change in the fourth quarter and reverted to our old measure but the only difference in this is we've got more precise data as we've been able to use technology more effectively across the network to measure units and as we got more precise we were able to give you a more accurate and representative measure of core price and that's what we're using today.\nKevin Chiang: Perfect. Thanks for the clarification.\nOperator: At this time there are no further questions. I would now like to turn the conference over to James Fish for any closing remarks.\nJames Fish: Thank you. So in closing today, I really want to reiterate what both John and Devina have said. I want to recognize the men and women in our operations around North America they have not missed a single day since the start of this pandemic and they are of course absolutely essential to keeping all of our streets clean, ensuring that we are good stewards of our environment through recycling, providing a safe reliable service that is absolutely critical to all citizens. So thank you to all of our men and women on our operations. And thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's Waste Management Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Release Conference Call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks John and good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter financial results which reflect the resilience of our business model, the strong execution of our front line team members who safely and efficiently serve our customers and communities each day and the solid proactive steps our team has taken to manage costs and capital expenditures in this dynamic environment. Our strong performance in the second quarter positioned us to deliver on our top financial priorities of strong adjusted EBITDA margins and robust net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow. As we started to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on our business several months ago we quickly focused on the EBITDA margin impacts that revenue declines in our highest margin industrial, commercial and landfill lines of business might have on our near-term results. We initially estimated that 2020 adjusted EBITDA margins could be impacted by as much as 100 basis points. In the second quarter of 2020 which we expect to have the toughest revenue comparisons of the year we managed costs to deliver an adjusted EBITDA margin that meaningfully exceeded those initial expectations. With the benefit of this strong performance in our economic outlook we now expect 2020 adjusted EBITDA margin to be in the range of 28% to 28.5% or flat to down 50 basis points on a year-over-year basis. Our strong adjusted EBITDA result is the largest single contributor to our cash flow results in the second quarter. Our net cash flow from operations was $856 million or about 24% of revenue in the quarter. As we saw at the end of March there is pressure on working capital from slowdown in customer receipts which we attribute to customers taking steps to protect their own financial positions. We are taking proactive steps to work with our customers to ensure that these pressures on working capital are managed and balances are collected for services provided. In spite of these efforts, we expect that a delay in the timing of cash receipts from customers could create an $80 million to $100 million headwind in the working capital contributions to free cash flow in 2020. Our operating cash flow for the quarter also reflects the impact of the deferral of payroll tax payments as provided for by the CARES Act. This deferral benefited our current quarter cash flow by about $40 million and we expect the full year benefit to be $125 million. Second quarter capital spending was $436 million, $142 million lower than the second quarter of 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we have decreased our capital spending to align with the current economic outlook. The majority of the targeted reductions were the result of adjustments in landfill cell construction schedules and a decrease in the purchase of steel containers. We will not reduce the amount of capital allocated to our fleet in 2020 but are considering the current volume environment as we finalize our planning for truck builds and deliveries in 2021. At the beginning of the second quarter we targeted a 10% decrease in capital spending from the initial range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion for 2020. The team has worked hard to execute on this plan for focused and disciplined reductions in capital expenditures and in spite of the volume recovery that's tracking above our prior expectations and our plan to accelerate the pace of CSD we expect to deliver on this goal and have revised our 2020 outlook for full-year capital expenditures to between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion. In the second quarter of 2020 our business generated $423 million of free cash flow. Despite the challenges from COVID-19 our cash conversion was in the low 40% range an increase compared to the second quarter of 2019. For the full year, we expect our solid operating performance and disciplined capital spending to yield free cash flow approaching $2 billion excluding the impacts of ADS. As a reminder when we originally established our 2020 free cash flow outlook we excluded impacts of ADS including advisory and integration planning costs from the target. We plan to provide a more complete view of the free cash flow impacts of the acquisition post close. Through June 30th our operating cash flow and free cash flow included $45 million paid for integration planning efforts. Our strong free cash flow positions us to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the second quarter, we pay $230 million in dividends. We remain fully committed to our dividend program, a strong balance sheet that provides certainty through any economic cycle and balanced allocation of remaining available cash to strategic acquisitions and share repurchases. In the near term, as we further develop our outlook for volume recoveries and position ourselves for a successful close of the ADS acquisition, we will continue to conserve cash and focus on a modest deleveraging towards our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times total debt to EBITDA. Turning to SG&A costs. Second quarter SG&A was $353 million, a decrease of $32 million compared to the same period last year. SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 9.9% despite the significant revenue decline in the quarter. These results include lower incentive compensation accruals as well as the steps we have taken to reduce discretionary spending in response to business impacts related to COVID-19. Even as the business environment begins to improve we're maintaining extreme discipline and evaluating our ongoing level of spending for non-essential costs such as consulting, travel and entertainment. Our cost management actions were partially offset by an increase in our bad debt expense of $12 million in the quarter. In light of the trend we have seen in our receivables and the acceleration of CSD which will increase SG&A spending in the back half of the year, we expect full year adjusted SG&A to be slightly higher than 10% of revenue. We're confident we're on the right path with CSD to continue to differentiate our service and provide long-term value to our customers and shareholders. Finally, our strong balance sheet and liquidity position us well for the current economic environment as well as funding the acquisition of ADS. Current and forecasted post-acquisition leverage ratios are well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facilities and we have more than $3 billion of available capacity under our primary revolving credit facility. Additionally, this week we closed on a $3 billion, 364 day revolving credit facility that positions us to immediately fund the transaction it closed and then look for the right window to access the capital markets for long-term financing alternatives. Our solid financial results this quarter demonstrate both the resiliency of our business and the success we are having in dynamically managing our costs. I want to thank the entire Waste management team for their hard work which allows us to deliver on our commitments to our customers, communities and shareholders. With that Marianne let's open the line for questions. Yes. It's a great question. We're not specifically giving outlook for the back half of the year on the price and volume components but what I would say Jim just gave tremendous color with regard to the improving volume outlook and I think that coupled with the fact that the Q2 execution on pricing was intentional and focused on being customer-centric and so we certainly expect an improving result in the back half of the year on price. So you can expect that the yield component gets back to closer to normal levels or outlook for 2020 and an improving volume trend. When we look at the back half specifically we're projecting that you have a decline in revenue of in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% and that's more significant in Q3 and then tapers in Q4 to about half the Q3 levels what we're projecting. I do want to point out particularly given what we're seeing in the market today that fuel prices did have a 2% impact on the revenue line in Q2; difficult to predict that specifically. We weren't predicting any added pressure on the top line from fuel in the back half of the year but that's certainly out of our control and not necessarily representative of the strong execution of the business which we're really encouraged to see the momentum that we saw at the end of Q2 and beginning into Q3. Thank you. Yes, Walter I will start this one. I think it's a really interesting question rather than specific on post ADS margin, I am going to focus really on WM based business because we're going to wait to give any financial outlook for the integration of ADS until post-closed but when we think about the strong margin execution in the second quarter, I mean hats off to our operators and the front line for doing a tremendous job and I think what you saw in those results is that we got the most expensive hour out of the route and we got the most expensive truck off of the street and so through efficiency, through improved maintenance, improved downtime there were really fundamental tremendous improvements in the operating nature of the business and those are things that the team is working hard to see how we hold on to in a post-COVID environment with improvement in volume outlook in commercial and industrial collection. I do think the residential collection margin impacts that we've talked about we're focused more on the price side of that equation to be sure that we recover the increase in our cost to serve but looking for efficiency in that part of the business as well. In terms of the strong execution in Q2 and how we think about that for the remainder of the year, I think the improving volume trends and price, price is really an important piece of that because we delivered this margin result in spite of having lower contributions from core price which we see really flow all the way through on margin. So particularly impressive when you consider that aspect. There are certain elements of the cost structure that increase in the back half of the year as an example fuel tax credits were something that we got a benefit for in the fourth quarter of 2019 instead of that being a second half of the year phenomenon this year those are spread, those benefits are spread over the course of the year. So that has some margin pressure in the back half as does the increased acceleration of spend on CSD which Jim spoke about. So really strong execution in operations and we expect that to continue particularly with the improving volume backdrop. Yes, Sean I will start that and then I think the others can add some color. I think the place that we start that discussion is on the top line and as I mentioned the outlook for the back half of the year is currently revenues being down 3.5% to 5.5%. When you look at how we finish June and see July coming together we do think that there is some potential for optimism in the top line results for the back half of the year but it's appropriate for us to be reserved and going too far in terms of how quickly we start to see the recovery certainly with the number of case increases that have been seen across the southern part of the United States and so that's really where that back half question mark starts but we feel really good that 4% to 5% is representative of how we'll finish the year. In terms of the cost part of the equation it really does come down to the operating cost leverage as the biggest driver. There are certain elements of cost over time being one of them which John spoke a lot about in terms of our ability to flex the number of overtime hours. That translated into $45 million dollars of operating cost savings in the second quarter and that's a tremendous result but ensuring that as we see volumes grow back and whether it be the efficiency part of the business, increased traffic on the roads, thinking about how we manage the work day that $45 million of savings is something that we have our eye on. Other elements of the labor line which is the biggest single component of our cost structure is really where we're focused. The pieces that are in SG&A we have at hand. I would tell you that the results that you saw in the second quarter we're confident that we can continue to deliver. As I mentioned, the increased investment in CSD in the back half of the year means that those costs will increase but that's an intentional investment for the long-term growth and customer-centric nature of our business. Yes. I don't know that I can get super granular for you but what I would tell you is you've hit on two of the primary factors. So volume recovery outpaced our expectations and so that certainly had some upside impact on the margin decremental impact that we had originally predicted and then cost control particularly on the operating line was even better than expected based on what we know the margins of these lines of business to be. I mentioned over time specifically health and welfare costs are another example where we saw some value to the results from a granularity perspective I guess what I would tell you is that health and welfare by itself as an example is just one of those cost categories that's difficult to predict but it had a marked contribution and around 25 to 50 basis points is what we see as a benefit for the year in health and welfare costs alone. Yes. I think Hamzah that last point is really the most important one for us and rather than get too granular in terms of specifically measuring what we think tax reform could do. I think we all know that we went from a 35% rate to 22% and so that dramatic change in the tax rate to ongoing business that's going to have consequences the bonus depreciation that you mentioned could have consequences but just none of us are going to be able to predict the outcome of the election or then any follow-on impacts to tax policy should there be a change in a significant shift in and who's in office. So I think you've framed it well. I think all of the pieces that you mentioned are the ones that we are paying attention to and the level of impact to cash is something that is significant and therefore we'll have a close eye on that but not trying to predict it at this point. Thanks, Hamzah. Thank you. Good morning Tyler. We hadn't specifically quantified that. I mean, I think the best way to think about it is the delta between the yields that we reported and the 2.5% guide that we would have given for the year and I think that delta is pretty representative of what you could say that the price impact was for the quarter. Yes, that's definitely something that we've got our eye on. The $125 million that I talked about for the CARES Act deferral, payroll taxes that's something that hits us in 2021 because you effectively have a doubling of that obligation in the year ahead but I think that, yes it's half of next year, half in 2021 and then another half in 2022. What I think is really important though is that the flow through impacts, the really strong revenue acceleration that you should start to see in 2021 as some of the COVID-19 volume impacts and those pricing policy decisions that we made in the second quarter, we anniversary those. I think the flow through of that to cash flow should help us to offset that year-over-year headwind but you're exactly right Tyler. Yes, thank you Tyler. I think what Jim has mentioned and Devina in another calls is that we have been sub 10% from an EBIT line and clearly getting well above that is the direction we are going to go. I certainly see opportunities to get into the high teens or 20% over time and we're making some headway and to be real specific I probably when Tyler asked the question. When I looked at even for Q2 with the elevated weights we still on the same store sales comparison made margin improvement quarter-over-quarter in Q2. So we feel really confident about that plan and I think the granularity is going to helpful for us as we look at the investment opportunities at residential line of business going forward to make sure we're deploying the dollars the right way and I've said on other calls we don't want to do it for practice. We're going to make sure you get the right returns, the right margins and the right protections in those agreements and in some cases we are going to have to make some tough decisions. We are fully going to do that. Thank you, Michael. Yes. We don't necessarily budget. We don't necessarily budget Michael our yield quarter-to-quarter. We certainly have that 2.5%. You saw some of the early impacts on the Q1 results that you just mentioned from COVID-19 because there were some early steps on fees as an example to proactively engage with the customers in the right way given what we were seeing. I would tell you we've tried to estimate where we think the yield number ends up coming in for 2020 and it's just a really difficult number because of the impact of units on the measure. So what we focus more on is that core price execution and we expect healthy recovery in core price execution in the back half of the year. I can get you those specifics after the call Michael but what I would tell you is the fuel impact to the quarter was $60 million to the revenue line. Yes. Yes. I think what's really important Michael is that the $100 million in the confidence in the more than $100 million of synergies is not reflecting our savings in the interest line. The savings in the interest line is what we were thinking about in terms of the returns on disinvestment getting over our hurdle rate and cost of capital. It's early for us to be able to speak to specifically how much of an interest savings there might be but certainly when we look at the requirement to redeem the bonds and on a weighted average basis those were above 3.6% and if you compare that to current interest rates there certainly is some value to be had there. It's just too early for us to say. We are really excited to be in a position to be able to fund the transaction at close but this will be a phased process for us and we can't yet tell you what the long-term financing might look like. Thank you, Michael. Good morning, Michael. This was purely a measurement change and we had actually made the decision in the fourth quarter and then just made an error in reporting our Q1 with everyone in the work from home mode and forgot that we had made the change in the fourth quarter and reverted to our old measure but the only difference in this is we've got more precise data as we've been able to use technology more effectively across the network to measure units and as we got more precise we were able to give you a more accurate and representative measure of core price and that's what we're using today."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim and good morning everybody. Our team has remained focused on the fundamentals of providing safe, reliable and efficient service to our customers despite the challenging backdrop. Our focus on execution paid off in the second quarter as we improved efficiency across the commercial, industrial and residential lines of business. By calibrating our cost to the current volume environment we achieved total company operating EBITDA of 28.8%, a 10 basis point improvement over 2019. The volume recovery trend we are seeing is encouraging. Volume declines in the collection and disposal business improved throughout the second quarter. Through the first few weeks of July we've seen further volume improvements despite certain areas of the country slowing their plans to reopen. We've adopted a proactive approach to service restoration and to-date we have resumed service for more than half of the commercial and industrial volumes that were suspended with the March shutdowns. While we are seeing some markets recover faster than others we are encouraged that commercial businesses, the backbone of the U.S., economy are showing strong signs of recovery. While residential container weights have declined from their peak increases they are still elevated by mid single digits when compared to last year. This strengthens our case with municipalities as we work to improve the profitability of our residential business and change the structure of residential contracts. It'll take some time to reshape this business but we are making headway. Turning landfill volume, external volumes for the quarter were down a little more than [18%] or around 13% if you adjust for natural disaster volumes in 2019 similar to what we experienced with our collection volumes our landfill volumes improved throughout the quarter with June being the best month down 11% compared to June of 2019 adjusted for work days and natural disasters. Looking specifically at MSW volume which tends to be the most resilient and a good indicator of trends particularly during a recovery the quarter was downright at 9 % while June improved to a 3.5% decline. Moving to pricing, we have taken intentional customer focus steps to help our small business customers in this tough economic climate which we believe will generate long-term customer loyalty and we're already seeing signs of it in our numbers. As Jim mentioned our net promoter score has increased. We took these steps knowing that there would be downward pressure on pricing metrics in the second quarter but we see these consequences as short term as we stay disciplined in executing our pricing programs. Second quarter core price was 1.3%. This includes almost 3% core price in the landfill business and 3.1% in the transfer business as we continue the positive momentum with post-collection pricing initiatives. We remain committed to the pricing discipline we have worked hard to instill to cover our rising costs and protect our margins. In July court prices started to trend back toward pre-pandemic levels. Our impressive cost pricing drove the solid results for the quarter. We improved operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 30 basis points compared to the prior year. The team increased efficiency across all collection lines of business along with significantly decreasing overtime hours, reducing routes and optimizing the fleet. Overtime costs decreased 30% in the collection line of business in the second quarter driven by reductions in the commercial and industrial businesses. With regard to maintenance, our focus on asset utilization for our fleet is yielding results. We reduced downtime by 23% the second quarter achieving 99% fleet availability. Year-to-date the improvement in downtime hours has resulted in $5 million of savings. We're also flexing down our post-collection operating costs by reducing variable expenses such as overtime and heavy equipment operating hours. Second quarter overtime costs decreased by 39% across the landfill, transfer and recycling businesses. The team has done a good job of managing costs through this pandemic and we expect that to continue through the second half of 2020. And lastly, let me briefly touch on recycling. The good news that in the second quarter we continue the trend of approving operating EBITDA for the business. For the quarter we improve the bottom line by nearly $8 million driven by a stronger blended commodity rate of $57 ton; our focus on operating expenses and continued progress toward a fee for service model. We remain confident that our strategy for recycling including our recent investment in MRF technology in Chicago is pushing our recycling business toward operational, environmental and economic sustainability. So overall our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as we demonstrated our ability to proactively manage our operations in uncertain times. I am extremely proud of the hard work of the men and women on the front lines who were instrumental in flexing costs down while continuing to provide high quality service to our customers. And with that I will now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our second quarter financial results and full year outlook. Good morning. Good morning. Sean, the only thing I would add to your point about getting over our skis, I think when you look at and as Jim mentioned we're looking at this literally on a daily basis by region by line of business is making sure that we continue to hold tight on the reins in terms of adding costs back and I think when you look at some of the numbers we all referenced in our prepared remarks and even as late as yesterday looking at the ratio volume coming back and what we're still able to do on the cost side specifically over time as Devina mentioned that's the area where we are absolutely focused and I will tell you the ratios of volumes coming back versus overtime is still favorable. I think that's why when you think about us having the margins we had in Q2 compared to where we lost the volume which was really landfill, commercial and industrial for the team to hold those margins and there is puts and takes Devina mentioned some of them is really impressive but I think getting out over our skis that we are absolutely focused on making sure we keep the reins very tight on OpEx as we watch this volume shift. Yes, Hamzah, this is John. So we've mentioned in early on when we were in the Q1 and the early innings of this that we were seeing cancellations just under 1%. We're seeing that numbers crept up to about 2.5, a little bit north of that but it's leveled out there. So we're not seeing big numbers in terms of cancellations. What we have seen what we talked about is obviously folks turning off their service or pausing their service and then gradually turning it back on. I think the one number we can center around is whether it's commercial or industrial we are over 50% recovered in terms of units and honestly if you look at commercial we all know education is a fairly good size chunk of our of the portfolio there and with the uncertainty there are actually our commercial recovery is over 60% if you net out the education facilities which we all know is kind of a moving target at this point. I was just going to say the only thing, this is John, I would add is if you look at landfill and transfer station I would point you to that in terms of the where we've remained disciplined, I mean so the impact has really been commercial and industrial but the other lines of business we continue to show [white] performance. Not at all. Absolutely not. Listen Tyler. I mean, we've talked about the added weights and the pressure that's put on the line of business. Here's what I can tell you is that, the additional weights that have come via this pandemic are certainly another discussion point we need to have with some of those residential customers but we started this program before that. Now I can't speak to what happened back the financial crisis. I'll trust you on that one I'm sure we probably had some efforts at the time. What I can tell you is that and Jim has mentioned this a few times we've seen obviously a lot of pressure on the residential line of business. We've seen margin erosion. My plan with the team and we have this down to the contract by region, by area to execute against long before this pandemic started. I will tell you what this pandemic has certainly helped us with is when you talk about further moving that line of business to automation containerizing being able to capture the waste, being able to price and get paid for the services including disposal that you provide for this is certainly an opportunity to highlight that. I don't know that I have seen or I haven't heard of any that of closed. I have heard of some places where they're running short on drivers. So that's not necessarily a great indication for them and that and I can't tell you whether that is a longer term trend which we've talked a lot about previously that Gen Z and millennials don't want to drive trucks and so therefore there's this pressure on the pool. I don't know whether that's it or whether it is or what the pressures are coming from but I have heard that. I have not heard though of any closures. It's probably a bit of both Jeff, this is John. I think at the table was up about 200 basis points given 180 basis points for the quarter, 190 year-to-date might have the inverted but almost 200 basis points. So clearly when we're seeing some volume pressure at the landfill we're always reevaluating what's the best use of our network and those landfill assets. So without having a number in front of me it's probably a combination of both some third-party volumes that went out in Q2 and our decision to backfill some of those volumes where it made sense for us. Well, I think Michael certainly there was a bit of a tailwind in Q2 with fiber prices specifically OCC going up but as you probably know we've already seen that retract back and while we had a good quarter in Q2 I would tell you just a little bit under half of that was driven by price the rest of it was really Brent and team doing a great job on managing operating expenses in SG&A and other ancillary costs. So that's what drove the other half of that improvement. So we're not, we still think recycling is going to be a tailwind in the back half of the year, not as big though because that revenue number is not going to hold through the balance of the year. We don't think. I mean, I am not sure I know the answer to that. I mean because there is a number of pieces here involved but well what we did say was that this would be the end of Q3 which basically means sometime between the August 25 and September 30 which is a pretty narrow window and it's hard though to say well we want to do it on a certain date because we just don't have enough certainty to say what we're going to do it at the end of a month or at the end of a quarter. That's not our objective. Our objective is to work through with the DOJ and of course with ADS and get this final. Well, Michael it's John. I would tell you that if you look at our pricing performance regardless of what CPI has done over the last quarters, handful of years, we've moved further and further away from that I think the example he gave is probably the best one which is historically the residential or franchise pieces of the business have been tied to CPI or some fraction of that and I think our ability to drive 3% core price in residential especially in this quarter is evidence that we're moving further and further away from that."

            "content": "Thanks, Ed and thank you for joining us. The strength and resilience of our business was clearly demonstrated in the second quarter as our results exceeded our expectations. At the outset of the quarter governments and businesses across the continent were responding to the pandemic with stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of broad sections of the economy resulting in sharp volume declines in our collection and disposal business. Our immediate priorities were protecting our employees and providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. With a framework in place to achieve those early priorities we then focus on optimizing our business for the new environment and we saw measurable improvements as we progressed through the quarter. Year-over-year declines in operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business improved each month of the quarter as we were able to successfully flex down our operating costs, eliminate discretionary spending and improved productivity. I am extremely proud of our team. Clearly the shutdown of the entire economy had a dramatic impact on the top line of our business. Yet even with a 10% decline in our second quarter revenues our team was able to improve operating expenses as a percent of revenue by 30 basis points, hold SG&A expenses as a percent of revenue relatively flat and most importantly deliver 10 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As we progress through the third quarter we are firmly confident in our operating model and are well-positioned to deliver on the revised expectations we have for the remainder of the year. Our second quarter results prove that putting our people first so they can take care of our customers communities and the environment is the right approach to ultimately rewarding our shareholders. Putting people first is fundamental not just to our ESG philosophy but to our business strategy. On our first quarter call, we discussed the actions we took to protect our employees' health, safety and financial well-being. We also took steps to support our customers particularly the small and medium-sized businesses that have been impacted most adversely during the COVID-19 pandemic. We helped our customers right-size their service levels, temporarily paused price increases, extended payment terms and gave a free month of service to qualifying open market small and medium business customers. While these actions had a short-term impact on our price metrics, we've strengthened our customer relationships and increased customer loyalty. Our customer churn for the second quarter was our lowest on record at 6.9%. We've also seen significant increases in our net promoter scores; a measure of customer loyalty. Overall, second quarter net promoter scores increased 82% and our commercial line of business score tripled. We are now turning our focus to the longer term to ensure that we come out of this pandemic a stronger more differentiated company. At our investor day last year we laid out our plan to continue to invest in technology to enhance our customers experience with us and increase the lifetime value of a WM customer. At that time we felt we had a strong plan to achieve some big technology wins over the next several years. However, during this pandemic several things have become abundantly clear to us. First, our customer service digitalization investment otherwise referred to as CSD is unquestionably the right approach. This end-to-end digitalization of our entire customer experience from the first customer contact to the service confirmation will be unmatched and as we've seen during COVID-19, the companies with a superior end-to-end online model will truly be differentiated in the post-COVID world. Second, it became very clear to us early in this pandemic that when we all move in unison as one organization towards the accomplishment of a goal. There is nothing we can't accomplish and accomplish quickly. No one within waste management thought we could move thousands of employees to a work from home environment in one week's time but we did it. This gave us confidence that we can be more ambitious and agile when it comes to technology advances. That's why we are now accelerating our efforts around CSD. Using the onboard units, the smart truck platform and our data analytics capabilities all of which we've discussed for several years, we will seamlessly connect all the WM functions required to service our customers, so we can give them a completely digitalized customer experience. This will put us on par with other great companies and other industries who have separated themselves through their own digitalization efforts. We'll have more details as we roll this out but we expect to see some early wins this year. And finally we're excited about the milestone we reached on the advanced disposal acquisition last month. At the end of June we announced a revised agreement with ADS. Additionally, earlier this week we and ADS entered into an agreement to an amendment to the previously announced agreement with GFL environmental and GFL is now contracted to purchase all anticipated regulatory divestitures for $863.5 million. We expect both transactions to close by the end of the third quarter of 2020 once we receive regulatory approval and the approval of the ADS shareholders. With all the additional work we've done since the deal was announced in April of 2019 we're confident in our projection to achieve more than $100 million in synergies even though divestitures are greater than we originally expected. We are looking forward to completing this transaction, integrating the ADS team and operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders as we add 3 million additional customers to our platform and service capabilities. Turning to our full year outlook, our second quarter results combined with the early stages of economic recovery provided greater clarity for our 2020 financial results. This has allowed us to again provide full year guidance based on current economic conditions and before the contribution from ADS. We now expect a revenue decline of between 4% and 5% when compared to 2019, adjusted operating EBITDA margin in the range of 28% and 28.5% and free cash flow approaching $2 billion; again completely exclusive of the impact from ADS. Our impressive cost flexing in the second quarter combined with the recovery from the reopening of North America both of which we anticipate will carry into the back half of the year mitigates what certainly would have been a more significant impact from the pandemic. In closing, despite the challenging backdrop we're confident in our ability to continue to meet our commitments to our customers and deliver solid 2020 results. During these unprecedented times our business model has once again proven its resilience and we remain focused on using this opportunity and our technology investments to create a differentiated customer experience that puts our customers at the center of everything we do to increase workplace flexibility for our people. With that, I will turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Good morning Brian. Sure I mean we are to your point seeing July continue to accelerate albeit at a slightly slower pace. I mean look at this kind of went from zero to not 70 miles an hour but probably zero to 60 miles an hour pretty fast and now we're moving back towards 70 miles an hour. The one area that John focused on was really MSW that has really been impressive. The second area that's and we're down 3.5% in MSW. The other one that was surprising to us because we expressed some concern about it in the first quarter was commercial and at its low point the commercial line of business was down as much as 15% even more in some areas and that has returned to down kind of 5% or 6%. So it's really rebounded and it continues now through July to show improvement. The one that kind of is starting to jump a bit right now that's good for us is special waste. It had been down even through June it had been down pretty significantly on a year-over-year basis and when I looked at the rolling week numbers which compared to prior year just yesterday those numbers are starting to really show improvement in special ways. So we're now actually up double digits there in special waste where we have been down deep in the double digits previously. So we are pleased with the progress we're showing on virtually all of our waste streams and our collection lines of business. Hi Walter. Yes. I mean I think there's a couple of points to make here with respect to price and maybe the first one would be to your last point there I mean there is this price discipline that we've talked about this morning that remains. We certainly haven't lost any price discipline but we felt like that it was absolutely the right approach to take during the quarter to pause on these price increases and some fees and also to really help small business emerge out of this by giving them a free month of service. I mean I can't imagine if I were a small business owner sitting in my living room opening my mail and getting my big price increase from waste management. I mean that would not have gone over well with me as a small business owner. So it was unquestionably the right approach to take in Q2 and honestly into Q3 that will persist to a to a lesser degree because some of these small businesses have not reopened and what we told them with respect to the free month of service was that we would give you a free month of service once you reopen. So I'm sitting in downtown Houston and there are a lot of small businesses that have not opened in the central business district here. I suspect it's the same in other big cities. So we will still see some of that weakness in pricing but point that I think Devina was really touching on was that when you think about price discipline and once we get past this short-term [COVID] effect, the price discipline is still there. John talked about it too in terms of landfills and transfer. That is something that is truly ingrained in our culture and so we don't kind of kick that to the curb when COVID goes away that becomes immediately reestablished but there was of course in Q2 a big impact from this more kind of sympathetic approach to these customers and we'll see some of that in Q3 as well. You bet. Hi Sean. Yes and one quick thing and I think John wants to touch on OpEx too but Sean, when you think about the conversation we just had about price, obviously it was uniquely soft. I mean -- but that softness dissipates over the next quarter or two back to much more of a normalized level of price increases and where we've been prior to COVID. So that certainly is upside for us but we knew the downside was going to be there and it was the right thing to do and then of course volume which we talked about earlier early on in this call and we think that volume while it has started to slow from the really steep increase that we saw in June it still is increasing and I talked about special waste showing some really nice improvement and then MSW and commercial industrial has lagged a little bit It showed a nice pick up but we are seeing some differences by geography and it's interesting when you look at the kind of the southern part of our network versus the northern part of our network, the northern part of our network whether it was the U.S. or Canada tended to shut down a bit more quickly and reopen a little later and so we think there is some real opportunity. I was in Boston a couple of weeks ago and honestly Boston for the first time since COVID really started -- is starting to feel open. I mean we were in restaurants eating inside and so those businesses are starting to reopen and so while  Boston and our New England area is still down relative to some of the areas in the south that will provide more of a kind of a spike upturn in volume for markets like New England, New Jersey, New York, those Pennsylvania. That's correct. What I would tell you Hamzah is obviously this process particularly around COVID is taking a little bit longer and I guess the silver lining is it's afforded us the opportunity to do that much more work and we have that much more confidence in our integration plans and it's given us the opportunity to look more closely at a granular level not just about kind of the normal SG&A corporate overhead synergies but really get in a little bit further into the details and have that much more confidence in what we're going to be able to execute against in the field and that's really what's driving that number. So it's an interesting question that we expected to be asked today. When I look at our commercial line of business and I look at those states that you just mentioned so the big four kind of in terms of spike, case spike have been Texas, Arizona, Georgia, Florida and so when I look at three of those are our best three in terms of year-over-year comparisons. Our best three in terms of year-over-year comparisons right now are Texas, Georgia and Arizona. Those are the best three out of 17 areas. Those are the top three in terms of commercial yards year-over-year comparison. So I would tell you that the spike and when you walk around Houston what's happening is that everybody's wearing a mask but businesses have not all of a sudden gone back to April or May. They're staying open but people are just more diligent about wearing masks and we're starting to see those cases level off. I heard Scott Godley last week on a business council called Talk About the fact that you're starting to see it particularly in Arizona, Texas those cases level off. So our business is actually quite strong there and as I said just a few minutes ago where we've seen a little bit of a lag are in those areas that that closed pretty quickly and then have stayed closed the longest such as New England, such as kind of the greater mid-Atlantic area, Pennsylvania but those are also starting to show some rebounds as well particularly as they start to move where some of these other states already are which is a reopening of businesses just with kind of a mask rule in place. So we're pretty encouraged by what we're seeing with respect to commercial reopenings. It's the one thing that probably stood out to us the most because we were least certain about it when we discussed it at the end of Q1. I mean look, we haven't seen anything over the last couple of months but I really can only speak to our own price discipline and I would tell you as I said earlier that we haven't lost an ounce of price discipline. What you've seen in terms of price erosion if you want to call it that was intentional and that we will recover. It's just we're getting ourselves to get through this hopefully this short-term impact from COVID. There is also somewhat of a corollary there on to the CARES Act with working capital on DSO. I mean we're obviously seeing an impact this year and that's not unexpected at all or not surprising at all. So you'd like to think that as we get into 2021 that DSO starts to normalize. Yes. I mentioned earlier that the 1% number crept up to about 2.5% and is leveled off. There is a little higher than that to be exact but what we've seen is that is and those are the customers that have been impacted and identified as having a COVID impact. So 2.5%, 2.6%, I think is about right where we leveled off at in terms of cancellations. You bet. Yes. I think there's going to be in the near term more of a cost impacts, bottom line impact and then more of a topline impacts longer term as we truly kind of differentiate ourselves and by the way it's why we kind of chose to accelerate is we have talked about, we talked about it in investor day last year. So this isn't a strategy that's unfamiliar to you. It's just one that we've chosen to accelerate for a couple of reasons. One is that we really felt like we learned that when we do accelerate something we can make it happen quickly for all as I said my script all in unison behind it. So I do think there will be some changes in how our customer does business with us and that will impact us a bit on the cost side and then over time we think that really starts to separate us from the pack. Thanks Michael. I would tell you Michael that obviously when we recut the deal which was really a month ago obviously there's a reduced purchase price. There is higher synergies that we commented on despite over $100 more million of divestitures and certainly there's going to be a lower cost to the CapEx but I will let Devina speak to the financing piece. Well, it's a bit of a hard question because there is a lot in the mix here. I mean it is interesting though because in terms of a true kind of year-over-year comparative basis whether you're looking at EBITDA or whether you're looking at revenue or whatever you're looking at, I honestly don't think we get to a fair apples-to-apples year-over-year comparison until the first quarter \u201822 because I think '20. Obviously, \u201820 is disadvantaged and then \u201821 will be greatly advantaged versus prior year. So what we're kind of looking at is when do we get to a true positive comparison versus 2019 and I think that probably happens sometime maybe as early as Q2 of next year, probably won't be Q1 but certainly Q2 looks like it could happen or Q2 or Q3 is when I think we truly get to a positive comparison versus the same quarter in 2019 and then to your question about what pieces are going to be moving in the right direction we've talked about a whole lot of along the call this morning definitely residential John talked about kind of sub-10% EBITDA margins and a lot of work being applied to that. CPI is not representative really of our cost structure anymore and so starting to move municipalities away from that price metric for us, some of which John's talked a lot about I would tell you this is kind of all in John's court but start starting to institutionalize some of the changes that we've seen on the operations side and maybe the same is true for SG&A. There is some expense that we just don't need. We don't need to have as much travel expenses as we thought we did. The Teams product that we use a lot the Microsoft product is a very-very good product and so I think that'll be a replacement for that and then as we think about some of these wins that we've discussed with customer service digitalization that will start to really have positive impact on us. So there's a whole lot of pieces here that go into this but we think by the time we get to 2021 kind of mid-2021 we're going to start seeing some positive comparisons to that 2019 period. Yes. Thank you. So in closing today, I really want to reiterate what both John and Devina have said. I want to recognize the men and women in our operations around North America they have not missed a single day since the start of this pandemic and they are of course absolutely essential to keeping all of our streets clean, ensuring that we are good stewards of our environment through recycling, providing a safe reliable service that is absolutely critical to all citizens. So thank you to all of our men and women on our operations. And thank you all for joining us."

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Given the significant and widespread disruptions caused by COVID-19, we will use our time on the call to discuss our response strategy rather than focus on first quarter results. Our immediate priorities going into the shutdown were protecting our employees and providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. Having established a framework to achieve those early priorities, we're now focused on optimizing our business for the new environment, preserving our financial strength and flexibility and progressing towards closing the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. We're taking steps to use the crisis to create a new normal. We're focused on opportunities to enhance our business, attracting top-quality talent and developing customer-centric solutions. I'm extremely proud of how our team has worked together proactively to address the challenges we faced during the last 2 months and how our frontline teammates continue to diligently provide essential services to our customers. As I've said many times, at Waste Management, we put our people first, so they can take care of our customers, communities and the environment, which will, in turn, benefit our shareholders. It should be no surprise that our top priority as a leadership team has been the health, safety and financial well-being of our 45,000 team members. We wanted to ensure that our employees could focus on continuing to provide exceptional customer service and not worry about whether they'd be able to pay their bills. So the first and probably easiest decision we made was to indefinitely guarantee 40 hours of pay for full-time employees through the duration of the pandemic, so that they know their jobs and pay will be secured even if COVID-19 reduces the number of routes or hours needed to service our customers. Of course, it's important to point out that we took immediate steps to protect the jobs of - while we took immediate steps to protect the jobs of 45,000 employees, we're managing the labor components of operating costs through significant reductions in overtime hours. Regarding health and safety, we're also working with vendors to make sure that we had appropriate personal protective equipment for frontline employees, including masks, gloves and a hand sanitizer. We quickly made strict changes to our daily processes to follow social distancing guidelines for our frontline employees, and we transitioned about 20,000 of our office employees to a work-from-home environment in one week's time. This has been a massive change to how our team performs their jobs, and overall, it's been a very successful transition. We're also providing paid sick leave for our COVID-19-related absences for employees and have extended benefits for backup childcare in light of school closures. The team has responded commendably by continuing to provide essential services to customers and communities across North America. Our team has also been focused on supporting customers, especially small and medium commercial businesses that are the lifeblood of our economies. Even with the substantial support packages, small businesses will certainly need a helping hand coming out of the shutdowns. Given that, we've helped our customers rightsize their service levels, reducing service where necessary, temporarily pausing price increases and extending payment terms. In addition, as I've said publicly, in an effort to support those small businesses, Waste Management is giving a free month of service to qualifying open-market small business customers as they resume their normal waste service and restart their businesses in a post-COVID-19 economy. Our customer teams are proactively contacting these small business customers in an effort to show our support and will continue to do so as states and provinces reopen across North America. We see this as the right thing to do and believe it will result in greater customer loyalty over the long term. We're optimistic that this enhanced customer loyalty, combined with the fact that we've seen less than 1% service cancellations in our commercial line of business since the start of the pandemic, are good signs for how our business will recover as businesses reopen and need our services. We're also working with our municipal customers to address increased residential waste per unit and helping them manage recycling challenges in areas where there have been processing disruptions. Turning to our financial results. For the first quarter, our business generated operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion. For the first 2.5 months of the quarter, our operations were performing extremely well, putting us on track to exceed our first quarter goals. Of course, the whole world changed during the second half of March, and we swiftly began to adapt our business and identify cost-saving opportunities. John and Devina will give more color on cost reductions, but I can assure you that we are maximizing our asset utilization and looking at all discretionary costs and capital spending. Maybe even more importantly, we're looking at this unprecedented event as an opportunity to permanently change our business processes, our customer service offering, our work, our office work model and application of digital business solutions, to name a few. WM has always been a very resilient business model, and we will make sure we come out of this pandemic stronger, more differentiated and even more resilient than we were going in. Finally, it's been about 1 year since we announced our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Despite the general business disruption caused by COVID-19, we continue to make progress and currently anticipate being in a position to receive final antitrust regulatory approval and proceed towards closing by the end of second quarter of 2020. We're looking forward to completing this transaction, integrating the ADS team and operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders. In closing, despite the fact that solid waste is an essential service and many parts of the business remain recession-resilient, we are suspending financial guidance we provided in February given the uncertainty around the unprecedented impact of COVID-19. At this time, we cannot forecast with reasonable accuracy the duration of the COVID-19 disruptions or the pace of recovery, particularly for small businesses. There are just too many unknowns, and any guidance at this time would be an educated guess at best. Poor short-term visibility does not, however, alternate the very strong cash-generating ability of our business model. In past downturns, we've demonstrated the ability to flex spending, manage capital and maintain solid pricing discipline, all in order to generate strong free cash flow and strong return to our shareholders. We expect to continue to do that in today's economic environment. And most notably, now more than ever has been the right time to stand firmly behind our 45,000 team members and our small business partners to do our part to protect their futures. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter as well as additional color on the impacts to our business from the pandemic.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. First, I can't emphasize enough how proud I am of the WM team. Our team members have stayed focused on safely serving our customers and communities during a time of extreme uncertainty and distraction. Despite the volatile backdrop, our frontline employees have reported to work, taking great pride in their role of providing an essential service to our cities and towns across the U.S. and Canada. While many companies are facing challenges to their supply chains in this environment, I want to take - I want to recognize the fantastic work that our supply chain team has done to keep our operations running smoothly. They've been able to continue to meet the needs of our business and the safety of our employees, including being able to secure personal protective equipment to protect our frontline employees for the next several months. There's no doubt that we have a dedicated team of men and women who are committed to providing the waste and recycling services our communities depend on. Turning to our results. Operating EBITDA grew 2.6% for the quarter with COVID-19 impacting our business in the second half of March where we saw revenue negatively impacted by $40 million. We've positioned ourselves to be responsive to the volume changes in our business and properly adjust our costs. I'll first spend some time talking about some of the specific ways that we are flexing our costs to respond to this decreasing volume environment. In our collection line of business, technology and analytical tools such as M100 provide data and visibility into our drivers' routes that enable us to swiftly remove overtime hours and optimize or eliminate routes when customers reduce or suspend service. These insights have allowed us to flex our labor costs in this rapidly evolving environment. For example, we've been able to reduce overtime hours by half compared to prepandemic. In addition, we've reduced commercial routes by almost 6% and industrial routes by almost 13%. And overall, we've parked almost 6% of our routed vehicles, allowing us to reduce fuel and maintenance costs. In our post-collection operations, we're flexing costs commensurate with this volume environment. These results are evident in our reduction of heavy equipment operating hours, overtime and other variable expenses. With most communities we serve under stay-at-home orders, we've seen a significant increase in residential container weights, and our disposal costs are increasing, putting pressure on margins. But as we discussed last quarter, improving the profitability of our residential business is one of our key focus areas in 2020, so that put us ahead of the game in initiating conversations with our municipal customers on price increases that keep pace with rising costs. We're having these conversations as contracts come up for renewal as well as proactively discussing the changing dynamics with our customers. Given the fluid environment we are in, I also want to provide some color on the volume declines that we've seen during the month of April. At the peak, we saw more than 20% declines in third-party landfill tons and industrial hauls and close to 16% declines in the commercial line of business, while our residential line of business has seen about a 25% increase in the amount of waste disposed. A large portion of our landfill business over the last several years has been driven by big businesses, C&D contractors and special waste volumes, and they account for much of the decline that we've seen. We expect that these volumes should rebound fairly quickly as the economy reopens and as our pipelines remain strong. On a positive note, as we progress through the month, the rate of volume decline improved, and we had 2 areas actually show positive net service changes at the end of April. However, we still saw low double-digit volume declines in our overall business. In order to help our customers recover post-COVID, we have internal task force teams to focus on proactive restoration efforts to facilitate volume increases for restaurants, retail and offices, which make up 60% of the commercial revenue impact. The extreme volatility that we've seen in our volumes and the uncertainty in knowing how quickly those volumes return are the primary reasons we decided to suspend our guidance. Turning to price. In the first quarter of 2020, core price was 5.5% versus 4.5% in the first quarter of 2019 with all lines of business greater than 4%. Landfill core price remained strong at 4.3% with collection and disposal yield of 2.2% in the first quarter. As a reminder, yield is calculated using current period volume, and as a result, in a declining volume environment, there will be downward pressure on yield, but that does not indicate we are lowering prices. As Jim mentioned, we have taken thoughtful, proactive customer-focused steps to help our small business customers in this tough economic climate and to generate long-term customer loyalty. These actions do not indicate we're abandoning our pricing discipline. We remain committed to recovering the increased cost of our business through pricing actions. While we aggressively address cost reductions related to our volume trends, we also remain focused on meeting our customers' needs. Our operations and customer experience teams are partnered to ensure we can swiftly respond to service increase requests and ramp our operations back up to meet their demands. We've developed a proactive approach to service restorations for customers adversely affected by the COVID crisis. Our goal is to ensure that reinstating their environmental services is seamless, so they can focus on getting their business back up and running. We're in a great position to do this as our 40-hour guarantee was the right thing to do for our team members, allowing us to remove overtime while retaining our frontline employees for the next phase, ramping our operations back up as efficiently and swiftly as possible to meet our customers' needs. In addition, our emerging self-service capabilities as well as the technology on our vehicles will help us support their needs as their businesses come back online. And finally, our recycling business performed well, considering further erosion in recycled commodity prices in the first quarter. Our average commodity price fell nearly 30% to $40 per ton. Despite a decline in revenue of about $60 million in the first quarter, the operating EBITDA contribution from the business increased modestly. These results demonstrate the success we continue to have in restructuring our recycling business to a fee-for-service model. Throughout the COVID crisis, we've been able to continually to safely process most recyclables as we encourage everyone to continue to recycle right. As a result of the demand created for materials we collect, we have seen an increase in OCC prices in April. While we are encouraged by the increase in demand and recovered prices, there are some challenges with other commodities like steel, aluminum and plastics as we've seen the prices for these commodities decline. Despite all these movements and restrictions in the marketplace, our team continues to be able to consistently move all the tons we process. I am proud of how we navigated the COVID crisis, in particular, how we've taken care of our people. This will no doubt help us with employee retention and ultimately help differentiate Waste Management as a great place to work. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our first quarter financial results and capital allocation priorities.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we have temporarily suspended our 2020 guidance, a step we view as prudent due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19. With that said, one of the strengths of our business model is that in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we provide our constituents, employees, customers, communities and shareholders with a great deal of certainty. Waste Management provides essential services to a diverse customer base across the U.S. and Canada. Our business is recession-resilient with more than 75% of revenues having annuity-like characteristics. We have experienced and dedicated team members who are focused on safely serving our customers, and we are finding them more dedicated than ever. We've implemented tools and practices that drive disciplined pricing, cost control and capital spending across our network, and so we are well positioned to flex our business with changing volumes. All of this comes together to position Waste Management to generate strong and consistent free cash flow and return value to our shareholders. We are certainly seeing declines in revenue related to COVID-19. And to partially offset the impact of the anticipated revenue decline, we're taking steps to manage costs and capital spending without compromising our long-term strategic priorities or growth opportunities. Some of these steps include limiting hiring, reducing or eliminating discretionary spending in travel and entertainment and consulting costs and reducing incentive compensation costs. We have proven in the past that we are very good at flexing our spending when facing challenging economic conditions, and we want to assure you that we will continue to manage our business to maximize cash generation and returns over the long term. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow in 2020, positioning us to pay our dividend, make opportunistic investments and bolster our liquidity. We're extremely well positioned financially to manage our business through COVID-19 impacts. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position with our current and forecasted leverage ratio well within our revolving credit facility financial covenant. Our liquidity is the strongest it has been in the company's history, bolstered by the recent upsize in our revolving credit facility to $3.5 billion. We took proactive steps to fund the ADS acquisition. So when you consider our cash on hand with our expectations for access to both short-term and long-term financing options, we are confident that our liquidity and financial position will remain strong through the acquisition close and the most significant challenges presented by the pandemic. Turning briefly to our first quarter 2020 results. I want to highlight how we see SG&A, capital spending and cash flows. Results that we saw in the first quarter is important indicators for what we expect for the remainder of the year. First quarter SG&A was $390 million, a decrease of 4.6% compared to the same period last year. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.5%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year. These results include benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals as well as steps we have taken to quickly reduce discretionary spending in response to business impacts related to COVID-19. The continuous improvement mindset we have fostered over the last several years is serving us well as we rationalize and optimize costs across the organization. As a result, we expect to reduce SG&A spending by about 10% of COVID-related revenue declines. Net cash provided by operating activities was $765 million in the first quarter. The strong start to the year was driven by operating EBITDA growth, but that growth was more than offset by higher cash interest and adviser costs associated with the pending ADS acquisition as well as a sharp decline in customer receipts in late March, which we attribute to customers taking steps to protect their own financial position. We are seeing this trend continue into April and are paying close attention to how this impacts our revenue, bad debt reserves and working capital outlook. Capital spending in the first quarter was $459 million, which is down modestly when compared to the same quarter in 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we are now flexing our capital spending to align with current volumes and expect to see a significant decline in capital spending beginning in the second quarter of 2020. For the full year, we are targeting capital spending reductions of about 10% from planned levels. Landfill capital makes up about 1/3 of our overall capital spending, and we expect most of the reductions in this category as we adjust cell construction schedules with declines in volumes. We also see opportunities to flex spending for containers and heavy equipment. Free cash flow was $318 million in the first quarter of 2020. It's important to highlight that our first quarter 2020 cash flow included over $55 million related to our pending acquisition of ADS and the ERP implementation. When we consider these items and the uncharacteristic customer receipt slowdown we saw at the end of March, combined with our intentional focus on flexing SG&A and capital spending, we're satisfied that we remain on track to deliver another year of strong free cash flow. The cash that we generate positions us to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we paid $236 million in dividends and repurchased $402 million in shares. We remain fully committed to our dividend program. However, as a prudent step to preserve cash in this uncertain environment, we decided at the end of March to temporarily suspend our share repurchases. In closing, I want to echo what both Jim and John have said. I could not be prouder of how our employees have responded to this unprecedented pandemic. I want to thank every one of our 45,000 employees. The work they have done and continue to do will make Waste Management a stronger and more resilient company as the economy emerges from the pandemic impact. With that, Blue, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital.\nWalter Spracklin: First, starting here on pricing. I guess I recognize that you will be taking some actions here, perhaps deferring any price increases given the environment. But overall, can you speak to the pricing behavior among your competitors especially smaller players and whether you are losing business due to some of that price action, particularly since the April period? That'd be great.\nJames Fish: Yes. I think - Walter, I think the business that we've lost, which John can go into in more detail, it's a very small amount of commercial business that we've lost so far has strictly been due to the pressure of this COVID shutdown, not due to pricing in any way. We have not seen anybody out there slashing pricing. I think most companies are out there really focused on the cost side of their income statement. And I think for us, specifically for all the right reasons, we put our price increase program to our small businesses on hold until they can restart those. I mean as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, small business is truly the group that is at greatest risk here and, hence, our program to try and help them reemerge. But as John said and I'll say, we're not - we've gone for a long time building this kind of price discipline muscle here. And just because it's got a 2-month or 3-month break does not mean it's going to atrophy. We're going to continue to make sure that we increase price to offset cost increases that we've seen and - but we are going to take a break with those small businesses until they get back on their feet.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay, that makes sense. My follow-up here is on just the understanding that your - you have less visibility into the full year. But just looking into - you mentioned April and as we model for Q2 here, I heard you mentioned low double-digit volumes and pressure on pricing or pressure on yields, I guess. If that kind of - if we were to kind of take the low double-digit volume and negative pricing as our Q2 and then decide where we go from there, would there be anything that we'd be missing or you would highlight that would either cause us to reexamine that assumption here for the second quarter?\nJames Fish: Yes. I mean the - there is a bit of - there is some good news here and - when we look at our numbers. And it's primarily on the roll-off and landfill side of our business. Those, as John mentioned - and good news on the - a bit of reason for optimism on the commercial line of business, although that one is the one that is less clear. We just don't have as good of an idea about what happens with commercial business, what happens with retail, restaurants, all the sporting-related businesses, office space. That is really virtually impossible to predict. There's no historical evidence for us to kind of look back into. But as we just look at our own numbers, I'll give you a couple here with roll-off. And roll-off, as John mentioned, was down, at its low point, in the 20% range. So I'll read off a couple of those numbers, starting with the week of the 15th of March. We were down 4.6%. That's compared to a pre-COVID week just a couple of weeks before but down 4.6%. So all of a sudden, the week of the 22nd of March down 11.6%, down 14.6% the week of the 29th; first week of May, down 17.7%; down 19.6% the week of the 12th. All of that is not surprising, not unexpected and not great. But then all of a sudden, the week of the 19th, so the next week, we went from down 19.6% to down 15.1%. The week of the 26th, we went from down 15.1% to down 11.8%. So a fairly sharp rebound in the roll-off line of business. And when we look at the waste streams within our landfill line of business that are most driven by big business, we're seeing a similar rebound. Where we're not seeing necessarily a big rebound we are seeing some signs that we've bottomed and starting to climb out gradually, and let me stress, gradually, is the commercial line of business because so much of that is driven by small business. And I just think small business themselves don't know what the rebound is going to look like. This is driven by geography. It's driven by mix of business. There - I mean, the small businesses that are tied to health care probably didn't even see a downturn. But a fairly significant percentage of our business is schools, for example. Schools obviously have been shut down. And there's conversation in Houston that they might do every other day in the fall. So we just don't have a good - we don't have good visibility with respect to small business. But the good news is that big business that's not in any kind of liquidity - doesn't have any liquidity concerns or going concern issues, that is starting to rebound. And when we look at those numbers, I just read you for roll-off, it looks encouraging.\nJohn Morris: Maybe, Walter, just a little more color on the landfill side. When we look and we strip it out by waste stream, what we've seen is looks like our landfill volumes on the MSW side bottomed out between like the first and second week of April, and we're starting to see not big improvements, but it's improving week over week. So we are seeing volume come back on the MSW line. Special waste, a little bit later. It looks like it bottomed out in the last week or 2, and that is starting to turn positive. And then lastly, C&D was obviously down pretty significantly, but we've also in the back half of April seen signs that that's flattened and started to turn positive. So there are some signs of optimism in our landfill volumes. And most importantly, the one we pay, obviously, particular attention to is MSW, and we've seen that turn positive here in the last few weeks.\nJames Fish: Well, and John and Walter, the - when John talked about 25% down at its low point for all landfill tons, heavily weighted there with the C&D and special waste, and those are really big customers. Those are big contractors. Special waste is almost exclusively big customers, and they're not going out of business. They just kind of went into a wait-and-see mode. Our pipeline, as John mentioned in his remarks, is strong. And so I think what you're starting to see with that roll-off and some of those waste streams at the landfill returning is big business starting to kind of turn things back on.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kyle White from Deutsche Bank.\nKyle White: Hope everyone is doing well. Just focusing on residential. Obviously, with the uptake in volumes on the collections side given the shelter-in-place orders, can you just talk about your ability to potentially increase pricing in order for it to be more appropriate for the increased volume levels? Have you had any success doing this to date?\nJohn Morris: Well, yes. I mean, first and foremost, I think our strategy on residential before this pandemic was obviously a focal area for us. We've talked about our plans to improve margins there. And I think if you look at our core price results in Q1, they're strong and stronger quarter-over-quarter from '19 to '20. On the volume side, certainly, we've seen plus-20% increases in the volume on a per-unit basis, and we've kind of broken that down. About 25% of it is open market, and the balance of it really is municipal and franchise business. So we are really focused on going back to all those municipal and franchise customers and having some conversations about what's going on in the volume. I mean look, nobody signed up for 25-plus-or-minus percent increases in residential volumes. And I'm sure, as you folks know and can assume, some of that is going to remain because I think what Jim mentioned in his opening remarks is there's going to be a change in the work environment. And I think we're going to see more people stay and work from home. So we're - that is a key focal area for us.\nKyle White: Got you. And then just follow-on. Can you provide similar level of details on the commercial line of business similar to what you just did for the roll-off and how the month of April looked? How is the beginning relative to exit rate of April in terms of servicing clients?\nJohn Morris: Yes. I mean Jim mentioned it. I think what we saw is it started moderated through the month of April. We had 2 of our areas or regions, depending on how you refer to them, actually show positive coming into the end of the month. And just in the - we're obviously like everybody watching us on a day-over-day basis, week over week. And I would tell you that each day, it's improving over the previous week. As Jim mentioned, it's not huge increases yet. But really, what's important for us is trying to figure out where the bottom of this thing is, and that's what we're focused on, and we feel like we've got a pretty good feel for it right now.\nJames Fish: I think the good news, John, on commercial, and Kyle, the good news on commercial, while we've said there's not a ton of visibility with small business, the good news is that we really have been diligent in trying to determine which customers are not going to make it out of this. And so John talked about that 1%. Well, we've scrubbed that number. That's not just customers calling us and saying, \"Hey, cancel our service. We're not going to continue.\" That is us proactively, through an enhanced process made possible, by the way, through our onboard systems, going back to them and saying, this is a driver, for example, identifying - through an enhanced call process, identifying a customer that looks like the doors are closed. And so - but it's still on their route sheet. And so that would all be included in that 1%. So 1% is a very encouraging number. That tells us that of all these small businesses, the large, large majority are going to try and make a go of this coming out of COVID-19. Now what we don't know is how many of them actually make it. We don't know. I mean you can read 100 articles on what the risk is to small business if this thing lasts 6 months or 12 months. It differs from New Jersey and New York to Texas and Arizona. So the other thing, I think, John, that you were going to touch on was the number of service reductions that we see.\nJohn Morris: Yes. No, fair, Jim. Thanks. I mean we went back and looked, and just under about 10% of our 1.3 million commercial customers have said have had some change in their service. The vast majority, as Jim mentioned, only about less than 1% have actually canceled service. The rest are either reduced or suspended service. And I think what's important to note there is about 80% of those customers came to us as their business has started to decline. But to Jim's point, we've been very proactive with our ops team, our customer experience team to use the tools we have, both on the truck and back in the office to be able to identify and work proactively with these customers. And granted, we might be reducing some yards, if you will, in this example, a little quicker than otherwise may have happened. But listen, this is the - we're playing the long game here. This is certainly about working with our customers, especially the small business customers, through a really tough time. I think the upside for us is that 20% I referred to that our folks identified as service reductions also provide a little risk mitigation because one of the things, we're talking about is what the financial position are these small businesses going to be in the past, et cetera. So what's gotten out in front of this and reducing those yards in a proactive fashion also protects us, we think, a little bit from bad debt and allowances for doubtful accounts in the future.\nJames Fish: Yes. It may - Kyle, it may end up giving - it gives us the best information right now, which actually maybe - may mean the number is a little bit lower for commercial yards because we're proactively addressing it with customers where they haven't reached out to us but where it appears there's a problem. But it also then, once we emerge from COVID-19, will give us a much more accurate number there. We won't be billing somebody with the expectation that we're going to collect and find out after the fact that, \"Uh-oh, they're out of business.\" We believe it gives us a much more accurate number during COVID-19, and then maybe, as importantly, a much more accurate number when we emerge from COVID-19.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Hope everybody is safe and healthy. My first question is, maybe you could touch on what you're seeing in container weights in commercial in April. And any thoughts as to - historically, the sector has lagged going into a downturn and coming out of a downturn. Maybe if you could talk about how the dynamics maybe different this time given this pandemic.\nJohn Morris: Maybe Hamzah, I'll take the first part of that. I think what we've seen in terms of container weights has been generally commensurate with the volume decline. We've paid a lot of attention not only to the volume and the container, but obviously, the weight per unit because, obviously, as businesses slow down, we're seeing less waste in the containers. So I think overall, what we've seen is volume declines or weight declines commensurate with volume in our front-load containers.\nJames Fish: Yes. Hamzah, with respect to kind of historical downturns, I mean, as you know, I mean, this is not - there's no precedence for this because typically, whether it's '08, '09 or whether it's 2000 or any downturn that you look at, there - the economy starts to - there are signs that this is happening, and the economy starts to ramp down into a recession. There was no ramp-down here. There was no ramp to this. This - literally, in a matter of days, the entire North American economies and the world economies, for that matter, shut down. And so there wasn't a ramp for this, which is - hopefully, we'll never see this ever again, but no ramp. And then the ramp coming out is less about kind of macroeconomics and more about geographies and cities and more about the virus itself and the phases that the White House put out. So it is so hard to know. I mean I would tell you with respect to commercial that we don't - I can't tell you when football stadiums or broadway shows or office complexes, I mean, we're in a Phase 1 status in the State of Texas, but I would tell you, it is a ghost town downtown. So there are no office buildings. They're open, but there's - but our office building here might have, I don't know, 3,000 or 4,000 people in it, and I bet you, there aren't more than 75 people in this office. So - and I just don't know. I couldn't tell you when the Houston Astros or all the little ancillary businesses around the Astros or any other sports team, for that matter, are going to play ball again. Don't know. So it is very, very different and trying to compare it to a previous recession just kind of feels like it's not applicable.\nHamzah Mazari: Got you. And Jim, you talked about potentially using this pandemic to make some permanent changes in the business. What do you see as sort of the big structural changes coming out of COVID-19? Clearly, work-from-home population could double, if not triple. You have to manage your residential business and your mix change there. You referenced that a little bit. But maybe if you could talk about what you see as sort of the 1, 2 or 3 big dynamics that will change your business coming out of this would be helpful.\nJames Fish: Yes. Absolutely, Hamzah. Look, I mean, one of the things that this taught us was that if we really narrow our focus and put our full efforts behind something, we can get it done quickly and we can get it done well. I mean you mentioned work from home. I would tell you, if I'd asked Nikolaj Sjoqvist, our Chief Digital Officer, if I'd asked him back in November, \"Hey, what's it going to take to do a full work-from-home solution?\" I promise you, he would have said 12 months. And we did it in 7 days. So - and we've done it well. We've really - may have been a few hiccups early on, but at this point, we're running smoothly. So to give you a - we did sit down as an SLT and talked about, all right, so let's say we put everything on the table, and then we pick 3 projects that we're going to get done or at least put a huge amount of focus into, and everything else is going to get - put on the back burner. And so what we came out of that meeting with a few weeks ago was a work-from-home solution. The good news about that is we've already invested in the technology. We - there's no pilot involved. We piloted all 20,000 people. So this is really just Tamla and her team making sure that we set up the right performance management metrics and that we look at all of the supervisory considerations and that we consider internal controls and those types of things. That, we expect to be up and running by June 1. We did talk about ERP, and that's something we've talked to you about and talked on this call about. And that was one we felt, look, we have 2 systems that have been - that aren't supported at this point, that are almost 20 years old. We have to move forward with that. That, by the way, is not going to be completed by the end of 2020, but it will stay on the schedule that we laid out, which is kind of a 2022, 2023 completion there for that. So that was number two. And then number three is really a - when we looked at who the winners are coming out of this, and there aren't a whole lot, but if I were to ask you, Hamzah, who's the big winner, not necessarily in our industry but just overall, my guess is that you'd say probably Amazon is a big winner. Well, you're right. Amazon has been a big winner, and then it's because they're the king of self-service. And so how do we digitize our self-service offering? It's something we talked about at Investor Day last May. And how do we expedite that? How do we expedite the digitization, the self-service customer experience and get that done in a very quick but very well-done manner? And that's - and those are really the 3 projects that we identified and said we're going to move forward with all 3 of those, and we're going to expedite it, at least two of them, while staying on schedule with ERP.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber from BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: I've had a number of investors asked me this question, so I'll just ask it to you. One of your larger competitors reported last night, seemed to be a little bit less impacted by COVID last quarter. And I think the near-term outlook, while dollar was a little bit, I guess, less worse than what you might be looking at. I don't know if you've looked at their numbers. I'm assuming you have. Any reason for those differences?\nDevina Rankin: What I would say, we certainly listened to that call and have done what we can, the same that all of you and your investors have done, to digest what we heard. And we would tell you that we think that we're going to focus on Waste Management and our outlook. And what we see is that the $40 million impact that we gave you in terms of revenue in the two weeks of March is not anything that we can use to say that that's representative of what you should extrapolate for the full year, which is why we've suspended guidance. We would tell you that what the company has been focused on and as we've talked about is responding well and taking care of our customers and our employees. We are controlling our costs and ratcheting back capital spending where appropriate. And all in all, we remain very confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow for the year. And all those things together give us great confidence that we will respond as well as we should in this environment and certainly as well as we expect the industry as a whole will.\nJohn Morris: Hey, Jeff, I think that one important point that we've all made through this conversation is trying to dictate where the bottom is. And we spent a good bit of time talking around whether it's landfill or collection volumes on some of the positive signs that we're seeing there as we came into the last couple of weeks of April.\nJames Fish: Yes. I think that - look, I mean, I didn't listen to their call. I mean Republic always does a nice job managing their business, so credit to them for that. I mean I do think we all are facing very similar challenges. I know they're trying to take overtime out, just like we are. We may be handling it slightly differently in some respects. But for the most part, the industry is, I think, doing a really good job of handling this. I do think and I don't know what they said about their commercial business, but I - as I've said several times on this call, look, commercial is - that's the big unknown. That's the question. How are they going to - how are these small businesses going to recover from this? Are they going to recover? How many of them will choose to just throw in the towel? When do all these schools open back up? Do they open back up the same way they went in? I mean we're hearing that - I read an article that said that as many as 40% of outgoing seniors from high school are going to take a gap year. That's going to affect colleges, and that affects our business. So I can't really answer your question specifically about how Republic is doing, managing theirs versus managing ours. I would say that for us, there are certainly some reasons for optimism, which we've gone into, specifically landfill and roll-off, which are really related to big business. But the piece that I think all waste companies are going to really have to kind of get our heads around is what happens to small business because it is unprecedented that you take the entire $23 trillion U.S. economy and shut it down. And so these small businesses are going to be impacted by that. And that's - honestly, that's why we didn't give guidance because we just don't - it's a big piece of our collection. It's a big piece of our disposal. And we just don't have good visibility. We hope that by the end of Q2, enough of these states will be kind of back up and running and into Phases 2 and 3 and on, that we'll be able to give you a better insight into what happened with small business. But I can't really say why their picture was rosier than ours. I can just tell you that I'm feeling pretty good about some parts of our business, and I'm not feeling pessimistic about others. I just don't know. I just don't know about small business right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Hope you're all doing well, and thanks for all the detail this morning. I guess first, just to touch on the question of decremental margins here. Devina, you walked through some of the cost levers that you have and expectations for SG&A. I guess is there a good sort of high-level way that we should be thinking about your decrementals here? Your margins, as you manage through some mix shift and an overall volume decline, is 35% to 40% kind of the right level for how we should be thinking?\nDevina Rankin: So we've historically talked about incremental margins being around that 40% that you identified. What I would say in this environment that makes giving you a decremental margin number to model or project that's particularly difficult is mix of business. And we've talked about the fact that our volume declines are coming in our highest-margin businesses. And we also identified that we think in the first quarter, we saw about 40 basis points of degradation in margin as a result of that high-margin business volume decline. We currently - based on our outlook, we think that 40 basis points - that 40 basis points will continue into the remainder of the year. And then when you combine that with the fact that we had expected 50 basis points of margin expansion in 2020, we think the full year impact to margin could be around 100 basis points as a result of COVID-19. That said, it's really difficult for us to know the answer to that question because I think what you've heard consistently today is just the level of uncertainty makes some of that difficult to predict. And what we're seeing is a great level of ability to flex the business in the industrial line of business as an example. But in the landfill line of business, if we see volume declines there continue, that's a line of business that has very good flow through traditionally, and the variable cost, the ability to reduce variable cost there is just negligible in relation to the rest of our business. So we would say that the best way to think about that is about 100 basis points of margin decline from our previous estimates.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just on receivables buildup that you mentioned, can you give some color on where in the business that occurred, if you can talk by sector or line of business? Or was that really concentrated?\nDevina Rankin: It really was across the board. We look at our cash receipts for our customer base really in totality. And what we saw at the end of March was an estimate of $60 million to $80 million of pullback in cash receipts from our customers, and we've seen that continue into April. We can only attribute that to our customers taking steps to slow things down. But also, we take into account the fact that we were all moving ourselves to a work-from-home environment, and we expect that they were doing the same. So we would expect that as businesses find their way back to finding a way to work in this new normal environment that we'll see a healthy bounce-back there and want to view that more as timing. We've got our eyes on it, and we will be watching it through the year. We did - just for additional color, we took about a $5 million charge to SG&A during the quarter for bad debt reserves because that's our best estimate of what we think that, that might mean to - that slowdown in customer receipts might mean.\nJames Fish: Yes, I might just add one thing to that, I mean, look to Devina's point about slowdown of cash payments from customers. I mean that is not in any way surprising to us. I mean, I can't imagine that these small businesses or big business in the month of April are rushing to pay their bill, if they even got their bill, if it went to their office and they're not at the office. So I mean, it's not surprising in any way that you would see that effect from this. And by the way, we think that the Olive branch, I guess, that we're extending to small business will actually have a positive effect on that. We think it's a sign of our commitment to them. And we think that, in return, it's a much easier call for an accounts receivable clerk to call after we've given a free month of service to a small business and say, \"Hey, just want to remind you that you're in your second month coming back. Hope all is well. By the way, you're a little late on your payment. We need to make sure that gets paid.\" That's an easier conversation than if we never changed anything. And certainly, I don't want to be that receivables clerk calling them right now and saying, \"Hey, haven't seen your payment yet.\" They're going to hang up the phone on me. So I think every company will see some type of impact on DSO. I can't imagine a day where you don't see an impact on DSO coming out of 100% economic shutdown. But the goal for Devina and her team is to be in a position to recover that as quickly as we can. And just like pricing discipline, we have working capital discipline here that we will not lose focus on.\nNoah Kaye: I appreciate that. Can I sneak one more in? Just, I wanted to clarify from the prepared remarks on the ADSW timing, you said you're expecting receipt of regulatory approvals by the end of the second quarter and then moving to closing. Did you say you expect closing to occur in - by the end of the second quarter or subsequent to that? I just wanted to understand.\nJames Fish: Well, no, I just said we anticipate being in a position to close by the end of the second quarter. I think it's important to point out that, look, when we first announced this deal, I don't remember the exact day but it was like the middle of April, at 19 or something of - what was it, John?\nJohn Morris: 14.\nJames Fish: 14. 14th of April, that we said it feels like the 14th of April 1990, honestly, because of this pandemic. But we said that it would take, we thought, between 12 and 15 months to close. We're at 13.5% or we will be, next week, so - or 12.5%. So we're within that window in terms of this being in anticipation or anticipating being in a position to close, so we're not worried about that. By the way, certainly, and I'm not going to blame anything on this pandemic, but look, we were moving 20,000 people to work from home. That included Chuck's attorneys who were working on this. That included DOJ attorneys. Credit to both sides for doing a nice job continuing to work even though we weren't traveling anymore. But no question, there was some impact from COVID-19 on this. We did not contemplate, when we closed this deal, any type of major economic disruption when we went about this in April of '19.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: John, could I get a clarification? What was the percent change in your total yards and service in the commercial business in April?\nJohn Morris: I think - I think we said 16%, Michael, was the high point.\nMichael Hoffman: So 16% actually is the actual yard change or is it the volume change?\nDevina Rankin: No, that was the yard change.\nJohn Morris: That was the yard exchange.\nMichael Hoffman: Yard exchange, okay. And that's the low point, and it's improved from there. Is that - that's the point you've made?\nJohn Morris: I would say it's improving, although as Jim said, it hasn't been as significant. It's kind of more flat in that.\nJames Fish: Yes, I looked at the number this morning, Michael. I think it was 15.2% this morning so it is improving. I think we've actually had a couple of areas. And I think maybe, John, you mentioned that, but it had gone positive, but it's creeping back.\nJohn Morris: Michael, I also mentioned, though, specific to we're looking at this day by day, week over week, so my comments are really - are that granular as we're looking for the bottom and looking for signs of improvement. But it's only been in the last week or two that we've really seen it bottom out start to show signs of some positive movement.\nMichael Hoffman: And I know somebody wanted to put you in a comparison test, but that's consistent with what we're hearing is that there's this gradual rolling reopening and so you should start to see some leveling off?\nJohn Morris: Yes. No, I agree. And as Jim said, I think the big question is what's going to happen in those handful of buckets we spoke to, retail, public sector, et cetera, and how they're - what rate they're going to reopen.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then there was a number given and I'm not sure I heard it correctly so I want to ask the question. If I use 2019's commercial revenue of $3.47 billion, what percent - there was a 60% number you said somewhere in the call today. But what percent of that is deemed small business versus larger business?\nDevina Rankin: Commercial, we actually look at more by customer type rather than size, so that's a difficult number to provide. But John can you give a little more color there.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Michael, we looked at it from a revenue and unit perspective. And what we said was is that if you look at office retail, the restaurants and the education bucket, that was about 65% to 70% of where we've seen the degradation in revenue and volume.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, all right. That helps. And then, Devina, I apologize. I'm not sure I totally understood your SG&A comment about how you're adjusting. Would you mind explaining to me? This dumb country boy didn't quite get it.\nDevina Rankin: No. So our objective with SG&A, as with most of our discretionary cost categories and places that we know that we should be flexing, is to flex in response to the change in revenue that we see. And with SG&A, we think that given the mix between what we view as controllable versus what we view as required in order to run the business, we think that for every $1 decline in revenue that we see versus our planned levels, we can take out $0.10 of that $1.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. That's what I thought I heard. I just wasn't sure. Okay. And then is the headquarter move still planned for the fourth quarter? Or does this throw a monkey wrench into that?\nJohn Morris: No. It's still planned. I mean, we have a signed agreement with them and so we're still planning on moving. And I think the interesting part will be, as we look at kind of a new normal with work-from-home, is do we use all the floors that we're committed to? You can imagine that Houston is not a great commercial property market right now, but we would - maybe we sublease out. We're not going to be able to sublease it out for top dollar but maybe we sublease out a floor. It really is going to be dependent on how many of our corporate office employees decide to or we decide that those jobs are better fit in a work-from-home environment.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then, Devina, of the total dollars of direct labor spent in 2019, what percent of that was overtime?\nDevina Rankin: It's about 15%. And based on what we got out, which John mentioned earlier, was 50%. We've actually seen it trend even higher with about a 60% reduction. We think if you held on to that level of cost reduction, you could see $150 million to $185 million of flex if for some reason you see this continue. I think what's most important there is that we've learned some things about how to optimize our driver hours in this pandemic, and we've learned things about what our drivers want as well. And whether it be trying to manage ourselves to more like a 45-hour work week so that overtime becomes less a part of our normal cost of doing business, there are steps that we can be taking to optimize the long-term cost structure.\nJames Fish: I think, Michael, the - yes, the interesting thing about - particularly about hourly labor and overtime is that we went through a fairly quick but thoughtful approach to the 40-hour backstop that we provided. And I think initially, there was some concern that, \"Oh, my gosh, what are you doing there?\" But interestingly, that has - there's been a pretty minimal cost of that backstop. Recognize what that is, it really is protecting their job, not protecting their paycheck where it was pre-COVID. So all this overtime that John and Devina have talked about, they recognize that, that would come out. As Devina just said, in some cases, drivers are saying, \"You know what, I actually would rather work 44 hours a week as opposed to 53 hours a week.\" So it has been interesting. And I think what we're seeing is that as opposed to just taking a - giving an hourly increase for all hourly employees, which, by the way, is going to be tough to get back once this thing ends, we decided that we would provide a backstop so it protects their jobs. It doesn't protect their pay. And it has been incredibly well received. I mentioned on an interview that - I mean, we've had some people that have sent notes to me that honestly, if they were - it felt like they were crying through their email. They were so happy that they at least knew that I have my job protected.\nJohn Morris: Michael, the last point I'd put on that with regard to 40 hours, the other thing it's going to do is as we start to recover, we've got capacity in this system with those employees where we flex down the overtime. And the thing that's been really interesting, attendance and morale have never been better. And frankly, our safety results have improved and we had a really good first quarter. And we've rolled in April and had even better results in April. You could argue, it's less traffic, all those other things. But I think we're seeing the best out of our employees and they're performing exceptionally well.\nDevina Rankin: Absolutely.\nJames Fish: So why don't we move on? We've got - it looks like we still have 6 or 7 folks left.\nMichael Hoffman: Can I just ask 1 last question, Jim, if I may?\nJames Fish: Sure.\nMichael Hoffman: Why pay terms for Advanced Disposal under the circumstance?\nJames Fish: Why - I'm sorry, say that again.\nMichael Hoffman: Why pay the current terms for Advanced Disposal, given what this pandemic has met? Why do that?\nJames Fish: Well, look, I mean, honestly, Michael, we really don't talk about those details on any acquisition, whether it's ADS or a $10 million acquisition. So I mean, I'd love to be able to answer that for you but we just don't talk about those, and we'll talk about that after the fact.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc.\nSean Eastman: I'll just ask one so we can - you guys can get back to work. I guess just going back to the Analyst Day last year, there was talk about the rise of cities, the rise of urban environments. Clearly, some of those population growth patterns could change coming out of this. And I'm just curious whether that's something you're thinking about. And just kind of how nimble you can be around how you strategize around that type of shift.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Sean. There's been a lot of talk about this urban versus rural kind of math, and we've certainly gone back and looked at it. And the interesting part of it is, is that we can certainly find correlations. You look at places like New York, New Jersey, Seattle that have been hit pretty hard by this pandemic. You can certainly see the impact it's had on volumes there and also maybe a little bit - they're going to be slower to recover, right, because they're still under these pretty strict stay-at-home orders or shelter-in-place. That really has been the learning for us. The learning has been not urban versus rural, but it's been about where have cities where municipalities gone into shelter-in-place orders earlier. And if you look at some of those, they've gone in earlier and that's where we've seen the volume. And I will tell you, we've looked to market by market. And where you would think there'd be a correlation, we've looked on the East Coast, the West Coast, Middle America, and what we have been able to correlate is it's really been about who went out early and how long they're going to stay out. And that's where we really see the shift in volume. It's been less about just strictly urban versus rural.\nJames Fish: Yes. I mean, I think there's been - I mean, we - as John said, we looked at it really market by market. I mean, there are some places where big cities are down less than rural areas. Philadelphia is an example of that, where when I looked at Philadelphia, it was down less than Gilbertsville or Scranton or Harrisburg. So it's - it really is more about the business itself. It's more about the shutdown and it's not just that the urban areas are down more than the rural areas. There are some urban areas that are down more than rural areas such as Seattle. But there are also - I just couldn't find a strong correlation either way, because as I went through probably 7 of our areas, I found big cities that were down more than rural areas, and I found rural areas that were down more than big cities, and there was no rhyme or reason to it other than just business mix.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs.\nBrian Maguire: Jim, I know you've talked in the past, I think, as recently as a quarter or two ago about one of the best barometers for the outlook for the industry being the health of the U.S. consumer. And we've gone from record maybe 40-, 50-year low unemployment rates to 60-, 70-year high unemployment rates. And hopefully, it's all temporary. But just wondering if you think that's still the case, if you still think that we could kind of draw some parallels and tangents to what's going on in the labor market and the consumer sentiment and outlook and use that as sort of predictive indicators for where you think the industry is going. And taking that a step further, as you look out to next year, if unemployment rates remain elevated like a lot of people are forecasting, do you think that it's just going to be a little bit more of a prolonged recovery than just reopening some of the businesses in these phase 1, 2 and 3 sort of rollouts getting completed?\nJames Fish: Yes. Boy, that's kind of a big crystal ball question, and I just don't know that I have a good answer for you. Here's what I would tell you as it relates to WM. I mean, I think that clearly, the consumers is going to be heavily impacted by this. My big worry, and this is just my own opinion, my big worry is that if we stay in this for too long, we are going to create some real long-term damage. And look, I'm not being insensitive to - I know you're in New York, and I'm not being insensitive to the people that have been affected by this virus, those families that have lost loved ones, I'm not. I'm just saying there is also a consideration on the other side, which is the long-term impact of this. Not just the long-term economic impact, but the long-term health impact, the long-term impact on things like clinical depression and things like that. So what it - how it relates to our business is that I do think those - this has been a pretty common theme this morning, but those that will be most impacted, the longer we go with this will be those small businesses because they - there was a report out yesterday that said, if this goes 6 months, that 40% of small business could be at risk of closure. Look, that's going to affect us. That's going to affect the Republic. That's going to affect everybody in every industry. I think as we think about our own business, the good news is that we do have a big landfill business that is largely driven by 2 groups, not exclusively, but largely driven by the residential business with third-party MSW and largely driven by special waste and C&D. And as I said earlier, those are big businesses. So I think the landfill business will emerge from this. How fast? I don't know, but it will emerge from this more quickly than other lines of business for us and other industries, honestly. And I think - I would say the same about the roll-off business for us for all the reasons that I just gave. As I've said several times this morning, the one that is going to be the most difficult one to predict is that commercial line of business. And I just don't know what happens with schools, what happens with airlines. And of course, that whole hospitality space is a massive question at this point. Does it ever return to where it was with rental cars and airlines and hotels? So I do think though that as cities and states start to reopen like Texas is reopening. We went to a restaurant on Saturday, pretty full. I mean, not inside. It was outside seating only but pretty full. And so I think you'll - those states that are able, from a health standpoint, to come out and emerge with kind of 2 months of damage, look, I think we can deal with a two month snowstorm. But if this thing is a 9-month snowstorm, boy, that's going to be hard to recover from. So I think the long answer to your very short question, it's really going to depend on these reemergence plans and how quickly we're able to reemerge, and that is going to most impact the commercial line of business. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nBrian Maguire: Yes, it's very helpful. I know we're running long. I just had one quick one just procedurally on how you're going to count some of the small business volume that's being suspended and some of the - I don't know if you call it a rent holiday for the month of April for folks. Is that coming in as a volume number or as a metric on yields? And any sense kind of how many - how much of the small container business might be able to apply for that sort of rent holiday?\nJames Fish: Are you talking about the month of service there, the free month of service?\nBrian Maguire: That's right.\nJames Fish: Yes, that's going to show up as price really. And that's why I said I want to caution about what it says with respect to price discipline. I mean, I don't want somebody to freak out in Q2 when we show a price number and it doesn't look very good because we've given a free month of service. By the way, just to give a little bit of context around that. It is not necessarily the month of April. It would be the first month that they come back and reestablish service. So - and it's not all small customers. It is - it's those customers that were forced into some type of impact by this. If your business had no impact, if you're a small health care facility and your business is up or if you're a small grocery store, then you're not - you don't participate in this because you weren't impacted by it. But if you come back and start your business back up as a restaurant, and you previously were 5-days-a-week service or - and now you're going to be 2 days a week, then we give you the 2-day-a-week service for that month in your first month. We're not going to give you a free month and a credit for whatever your bill was back in November.\nJohn Morris: Brian, I would just say we met - we said in the beginning, right now, a little bit less than 10% of our commercial customers, total commercial customers have been affected by this. So it would obviously be a subset, a small subset of that number.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Sorry, I was having a hard time getting on the call so if you addressed this, I'm sorry. But John, I do want to come back to the pricing commentary. I appreciate your philosophy hasn't changed. Are you seeing anything irrational from small haulers or other landfill operators? And are you hearing about service failures for small haulers are then simply exiting the market?\nJohn Morris: So Jim did comment on that specifically, Tyler, in the beginning. And again, we're 7 weeks into this and I don't think there's been anything out of the ordinary that we've observed. I'm not going to comment on what other folks are doing. I can just tell you that whether it's our collection pricing discipline. I spoke to our post-collection pricing discipline. By the way, the cost structure in those spaces has obviously has not subsided so we're going to continue. I think the way to look at this is you just heard the commentary from Jim about the small business. We're going to pause on a subsection of our customers to help them through this tough time. But our strategy around recovering costs to protect, in particular, our landfills and our collection lines of business is not changing.\nJames Fish: And Tyler, to your second question, I have not - I haven't heard of any small horse throwing in the towel. I mean I think because we're all considered an essential service, my guess is that it's not as if you're going from full revenue to 0 revenue like some of these businesses are.\nTyler Brown: Yes. Okay. So this is my big picture question. I hate to come back to residential, but is residential basically having a national sword moment? And what I mean by that is resi has already been struggling. The last call in Q4, you said it's your worst-performing collection line. Margins are down 50% from the past 5 to 10 years. Now you've got surge in container weights and it feels like that paradigm shifted. I know it's early, but why don't we need to go through a fundamental stair-step in resi pricing to relevel that field?\nJohn Morris: Tyler, I will tell you, you've heard me on the last 4 or 5 calls or since I've assumed this position, that is a focal area for me pre-pandemic. And obviously, we've got additional work to do now that we've referenced some of these container weights. And listen, we also - we're 7 weeks into this so a lot of what we're seeing is we're trying to see, as I mentioned earlier, where the bottom is or where the peak is on disposal volumes. And we're starting to see some signs that's going to mitigate. The real question is, how much is it going to be up permanently and how do we amend our strategy? What I can tell you is before this pandemic hit, we have dedicated resources around the organization that are focused on residential. What we've done is we've obviously had another chapter to their book here, that they've got to go have some difficult conversations with some municipalities.\nJames Fish: John told me he left his car running in the parking garage and as soon as we're done here, he's heading over to meet with some of our municipalities. That's how urgent this is. I mean, we - half kidding there but half not. I mean, we have to - we - you're right, Tyler. We really do have to look at how - I mean, there's no reason to believe that all of a sudden, we're going to go back to pre-COVID on this. I mean, there are going to be a lot of people that are working from home permanently and waits for the...\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC.\nKevin Chiang: Just one for me. Thanks for all the trend data. I just wondered if you could delineate that between urban, I guess, your rural markets. Are you seeing that broad-based in terms of a bottoming? Or urban markets may be showing a bottoming first? Because as you mentioned, they went down at the lockdown first, and rural markets are still trying to find the bottom. Just trying to get a sense of how you would maybe look at those two markets separately.\nJohn Morris: No. I would tell you that where the - the urban markets, obviously, we referenced a few of them where they've gone out earlier and so they got to their bottom quicker. And as I said, we're starting to see a flattening and some slight signs of improvement. In the rural markets, we've also seen some declines. And as Jim mentioned, he referenced a bunch of specific markets we've looked at. And there's no clear correlation that just because one is rural or one is urban, that the volume decline has been faster or longer in between those two. I think what we are confident in is I think we are - have found most of the bottoms and where we haven't, it looks like we're at least at the flat part of the curve. And we're optimistic we're going to start seeing volume increases there in the near term.\nJames Fish: Yes. I think kind of the same answer there that we gave before in terms of not seeing real trends that were discernible. I mean, I did look again at some data yesterday. I had a look at San Antonio and Austin. Those happen to be two big cities that are not down as much as some of their rural counterparts, at least for us. And so in terms of the bounce-back, because Texas is now in phase 1, I wanted to see whether these cities are coming back more quickly. Houston, which is down more than San Antonio, and Austin, does appear to be, at least for us, appear to have more bounce back to it. And when I looked at Houston versus some of its smaller rural counterparts, yes, I mean, I guess, in some cases, it's bouncing back quicker but it's just really hard to tell because Houston was - is a big city. San Antonio is a big city yet San Antonio was down barely double digits in some of these metrics, whereas Houston was down closer to the numbers that John gave.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Mark Neville from Scotiabank.\nMark Neville: I'll keep it to one. I guess my question, just around - I appreciate sort of the lack of visibility and the suspension of the outlook. Again, to your point, it sounds like some of the data is getting a little bit better. Devina, I think you referenced, just on the CapEx, was a 10% drop this year. So I guess my question, just curious how you got to that number. I guess what I'm thinking is if you were thinking earnings cash flow would be down something significantly more than that, maybe there's more room to flex that line or that spend. So yes, I guess I'm just curious around the CapEx, sort of how you got to the 10%, and that's sort of a fair way to think about your early thoughts on what the year might look like?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, sure. So what I want to start with is that the 10% isn't inclusive of intentional investments that we may make in advancing those initiatives that Jim spoke to earlier. That's more in our volume-oriented business. And so when we thought about how we targeted a capital expenditure reduction that we thought was appropriate based on what we were seeing for the year, we looked at those volume numbers that we've talked so much about over the course of the call. And so whether it be industrial volumes or landfill volumes, which we've talked about being down double digits, that was the barometer that we used to then pull back to the capital category and say what level of flex do we think is appropriate. If we see a rebound in industrial flex, we can turn it back up. What we want our shareholders to understand is that the company is going to be responsive and diligent in managing its cash flows, and that includes investing capital for the long term because these are long-term investments that need to be prudent, not just for today but for the foreseeable future. When we think about capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue, we think maintenance capital is in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%. We've trended higher in recent years because we've seen healthy volume growth. And so in this environment, what we thought was prudent is to look at a 10% target as kind of our baseline, and we'll adjust that as appropriate if we see volumes rebound quicker than we might project today.\nMark Neville: Okay, that's fair. And again, sort of the - I just want to clarify the point, the 10% down but there would be some special investments, sort of that would bring that - it would be down less than 10%, I guess? Is that correct?\nDevina Rankin: It could be, yes. We're in the early phases of evaluating those investments so I can't specifically quantify what we think that will be, but that 10% is exclusive of those investments.\nOperator: I'm seeing no more questions in queue. Please continue.\nJames Fish: Yes. Thank you very much, Blue. So lastly, I just want to say, as I always do, thanks to our 45,000 employees who really have continued to represent the best that this company is. And you've heard me speak about this many times. You've heard me speak about it today, but our commitment to putting our people first during this truly, truly unprecedented time has never wavered. And I think it's shown through during this - our leaders certainly have shown up in ways that I honestly had never seen and have really, I think, unified our efforts to just not compromise on our commitments to our people, to our customers and to our shareholders. And with that, I mean, I couldn't be prouder of our management team and of all of our 45,000 people. We're still working through what the new normal looks like, but I can assure you that Waste Management will come out of this stronger on the other side. Thank you very much for your time this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. Thank you for participating.",

            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As Jim mentioned, we have temporarily suspended our 2020 guidance, a step we view as prudent due to the uncertainty created by COVID-19. With that said, one of the strengths of our business model is that in the face of unprecedented uncertainty, we provide our constituents, employees, customers, communities and shareholders with a great deal of certainty. Waste Management provides essential services to a diverse customer base across the U.S. and Canada. Our business is recession-resilient with more than 75% of revenues having annuity-like characteristics. We have experienced and dedicated team members who are focused on safely serving our customers, and we are finding them more dedicated than ever. We've implemented tools and practices that drive disciplined pricing, cost control and capital spending across our network, and so we are well positioned to flex our business with changing volumes. All of this comes together to position Waste Management to generate strong and consistent free cash flow and return value to our shareholders. We are certainly seeing declines in revenue related to COVID-19. And to partially offset the impact of the anticipated revenue decline, we're taking steps to manage costs and capital spending without compromising our long-term strategic priorities or growth opportunities. Some of these steps include limiting hiring, reducing or eliminating discretionary spending in travel and entertainment and consulting costs and reducing incentive compensation costs. We have proven in the past that we are very good at flexing our spending when facing challenging economic conditions, and we want to assure you that we will continue to manage our business to maximize cash generation and returns over the long term. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow in 2020, positioning us to pay our dividend, make opportunistic investments and bolster our liquidity. We're extremely well positioned financially to manage our business through COVID-19 impacts. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position with our current and forecasted leverage ratio well within our revolving credit facility financial covenant. Our liquidity is the strongest it has been in the company's history, bolstered by the recent upsize in our revolving credit facility to $3.5 billion. We took proactive steps to fund the ADS acquisition. So when you consider our cash on hand with our expectations for access to both short-term and long-term financing options, we are confident that our liquidity and financial position will remain strong through the acquisition close and the most significant challenges presented by the pandemic. Turning briefly to our first quarter 2020 results. I want to highlight how we see SG&A, capital spending and cash flows. Results that we saw in the first quarter is important indicators for what we expect for the remainder of the year. First quarter SG&A was $390 million, a decrease of 4.6% compared to the same period last year. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 10.5%, an improvement of 60 basis points over last year. These results include benefits from lower incentive compensation accruals as well as steps we have taken to quickly reduce discretionary spending in response to business impacts related to COVID-19. The continuous improvement mindset we have fostered over the last several years is serving us well as we rationalize and optimize costs across the organization. As a result, we expect to reduce SG&A spending by about 10% of COVID-related revenue declines. Net cash provided by operating activities was $765 million in the first quarter. The strong start to the year was driven by operating EBITDA growth, but that growth was more than offset by higher cash interest and adviser costs associated with the pending ADS acquisition as well as a sharp decline in customer receipts in late March, which we attribute to customers taking steps to protect their own financial position. We are seeing this trend continue into April and are paying close attention to how this impacts our revenue, bad debt reserves and working capital outlook. Capital spending in the first quarter was $459 million, which is down modestly when compared to the same quarter in 2019. While we continue to prioritize investments in the long-term growth of our business, we are now flexing our capital spending to align with current volumes and expect to see a significant decline in capital spending beginning in the second quarter of 2020. For the full year, we are targeting capital spending reductions of about 10% from planned levels. Landfill capital makes up about 1/3 of our overall capital spending, and we expect most of the reductions in this category as we adjust cell construction schedules with declines in volumes. We also see opportunities to flex spending for containers and heavy equipment. Free cash flow was $318 million in the first quarter of 2020. It's important to highlight that our first quarter 2020 cash flow included over $55 million related to our pending acquisition of ADS and the ERP implementation. When we consider these items and the uncharacteristic customer receipt slowdown we saw at the end of March, combined with our intentional focus on flexing SG&A and capital spending, we're satisfied that we remain on track to deliver another year of strong free cash flow. The cash that we generate positions us to invest in our business and return cash to our shareholders. In the first quarter, we paid $236 million in dividends and repurchased $402 million in shares. We remain fully committed to our dividend program. However, as a prudent step to preserve cash in this uncertain environment, we decided at the end of March to temporarily suspend our share repurchases. In closing, I want to echo what both Jim and John have said. I could not be prouder of how our employees have responded to this unprecedented pandemic. I want to thank every one of our 45,000 employees. The work they have done and continue to do will make Waste Management a stronger and more resilient company as the economy emerges from the pandemic impact. With that, Blue, let's open the line for questions. What I would say, we certainly listened to that call and have done what we can, the same that all of you and your investors have done, to digest what we heard. And we would tell you that we think that we're going to focus on Waste Management and our outlook. And what we see is that the $40 million impact that we gave you in terms of revenue in the two weeks of March is not anything that we can use to say that that's representative of what you should extrapolate for the full year, which is why we've suspended guidance. We would tell you that what the company has been focused on and as we've talked about is responding well and taking care of our customers and our employees. We are controlling our costs and ratcheting back capital spending where appropriate. And all in all, we remain very confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow for the year. And all those things together give us great confidence that we will respond as well as we should in this environment and certainly as well as we expect the industry as a whole will. So we've historically talked about incremental margins being around that 40% that you identified. What I would say in this environment that makes giving you a decremental margin number to model or project that's particularly difficult is mix of business. And we've talked about the fact that our volume declines are coming in our highest-margin businesses. And we also identified that we think in the first quarter, we saw about 40 basis points of degradation in margin as a result of that high-margin business volume decline. We currently - based on our outlook, we think that 40 basis points - that 40 basis points will continue into the remainder of the year. And then when you combine that with the fact that we had expected 50 basis points of margin expansion in 2020, we think the full year impact to margin could be around 100 basis points as a result of COVID-19. That said, it's really difficult for us to know the answer to that question because I think what you've heard consistently today is just the level of uncertainty makes some of that difficult to predict. And what we're seeing is a great level of ability to flex the business in the industrial line of business as an example. But in the landfill line of business, if we see volume declines there continue, that's a line of business that has very good flow through traditionally, and the variable cost, the ability to reduce variable cost there is just negligible in relation to the rest of our business. So we would say that the best way to think about that is about 100 basis points of margin decline from our previous estimates. It really was across the board. We look at our cash receipts for our customer base really in totality. And what we saw at the end of March was an estimate of $60 million to $80 million of pullback in cash receipts from our customers, and we've seen that continue into April. We can only attribute that to our customers taking steps to slow things down. But also, we take into account the fact that we were all moving ourselves to a work-from-home environment, and we expect that they were doing the same. So we would expect that as businesses find their way back to finding a way to work in this new normal environment that we'll see a healthy bounce-back there and want to view that more as timing. We've got our eyes on it, and we will be watching it through the year. We did - just for additional color, we took about a $5 million charge to SG&A during the quarter for bad debt reserves because that's our best estimate of what we think that, that might mean to - that slowdown in customer receipts might mean. No, that was the yard change. Commercial, we actually look at more by customer type rather than size, so that's a difficult number to provide. But John can you give a little more color there. No. So our objective with SG&A, as with most of our discretionary cost categories and places that we know that we should be flexing, is to flex in response to the change in revenue that we see. And with SG&A, we think that given the mix between what we view as controllable versus what we view as required in order to run the business, we think that for every $1 decline in revenue that we see versus our planned levels, we can take out $0.10 of that $1. It's about 15%. And based on what we got out, which John mentioned earlier, was 50%. We've actually seen it trend even higher with about a 60% reduction. We think if you held on to that level of cost reduction, you could see $150 million to $185 million of flex if for some reason you see this continue. I think what's most important there is that we've learned some things about how to optimize our driver hours in this pandemic, and we've learned things about what our drivers want as well. And whether it be trying to manage ourselves to more like a 45-hour work week so that overtime becomes less a part of our normal cost of doing business, there are steps that we can be taking to optimize the long-term cost structure. Absolutely. Yes, sure. So what I want to start with is that the 10% isn't inclusive of intentional investments that we may make in advancing those initiatives that Jim spoke to earlier. That's more in our volume-oriented business. And so when we thought about how we targeted a capital expenditure reduction that we thought was appropriate based on what we were seeing for the year, we looked at those volume numbers that we've talked so much about over the course of the call. And so whether it be industrial volumes or landfill volumes, which we've talked about being down double digits, that was the barometer that we used to then pull back to the capital category and say what level of flex do we think is appropriate. If we see a rebound in industrial flex, we can turn it back up. What we want our shareholders to understand is that the company is going to be responsive and diligent in managing its cash flows, and that includes investing capital for the long term because these are long-term investments that need to be prudent, not just for today but for the foreseeable future. When we think about capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue, we think maintenance capital is in the range of 8.5% to 9.5%. We've trended higher in recent years because we've seen healthy volume growth. And so in this environment, what we thought was prudent is to look at a 10% target as kind of our baseline, and we'll adjust that as appropriate if we see volumes rebound quicker than we might project today. It could be, yes. We're in the early phases of evaluating those investments so I can't specifically quantify what we think that will be, but that 10% is exclusive of those investments."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. First, I can't emphasize enough how proud I am of the WM team. Our team members have stayed focused on safely serving our customers and communities during a time of extreme uncertainty and distraction. Despite the volatile backdrop, our frontline employees have reported to work, taking great pride in their role of providing an essential service to our cities and towns across the U.S. and Canada. While many companies are facing challenges to their supply chains in this environment, I want to take - I want to recognize the fantastic work that our supply chain team has done to keep our operations running smoothly. They've been able to continue to meet the needs of our business and the safety of our employees, including being able to secure personal protective equipment to protect our frontline employees for the next several months. There's no doubt that we have a dedicated team of men and women who are committed to providing the waste and recycling services our communities depend on. Turning to our results. Operating EBITDA grew 2.6% for the quarter with COVID-19 impacting our business in the second half of March where we saw revenue negatively impacted by $40 million. We've positioned ourselves to be responsive to the volume changes in our business and properly adjust our costs. I'll first spend some time talking about some of the specific ways that we are flexing our costs to respond to this decreasing volume environment. In our collection line of business, technology and analytical tools such as M100 provide data and visibility into our drivers' routes that enable us to swiftly remove overtime hours and optimize or eliminate routes when customers reduce or suspend service. These insights have allowed us to flex our labor costs in this rapidly evolving environment. For example, we've been able to reduce overtime hours by half compared to prepandemic. In addition, we've reduced commercial routes by almost 6% and industrial routes by almost 13%. And overall, we've parked almost 6% of our routed vehicles, allowing us to reduce fuel and maintenance costs. In our post-collection operations, we're flexing costs commensurate with this volume environment. These results are evident in our reduction of heavy equipment operating hours, overtime and other variable expenses. With most communities we serve under stay-at-home orders, we've seen a significant increase in residential container weights, and our disposal costs are increasing, putting pressure on margins. But as we discussed last quarter, improving the profitability of our residential business is one of our key focus areas in 2020, so that put us ahead of the game in initiating conversations with our municipal customers on price increases that keep pace with rising costs. We're having these conversations as contracts come up for renewal as well as proactively discussing the changing dynamics with our customers. Given the fluid environment we are in, I also want to provide some color on the volume declines that we've seen during the month of April. At the peak, we saw more than 20% declines in third-party landfill tons and industrial hauls and close to 16% declines in the commercial line of business, while our residential line of business has seen about a 25% increase in the amount of waste disposed. A large portion of our landfill business over the last several years has been driven by big businesses, C&D contractors and special waste volumes, and they account for much of the decline that we've seen. We expect that these volumes should rebound fairly quickly as the economy reopens and as our pipelines remain strong. On a positive note, as we progress through the month, the rate of volume decline improved, and we had 2 areas actually show positive net service changes at the end of April. However, we still saw low double-digit volume declines in our overall business. In order to help our customers recover post-COVID, we have internal task force teams to focus on proactive restoration efforts to facilitate volume increases for restaurants, retail and offices, which make up 60% of the commercial revenue impact. The extreme volatility that we've seen in our volumes and the uncertainty in knowing how quickly those volumes return are the primary reasons we decided to suspend our guidance. Turning to price. In the first quarter of 2020, core price was 5.5% versus 4.5% in the first quarter of 2019 with all lines of business greater than 4%. Landfill core price remained strong at 4.3% with collection and disposal yield of 2.2% in the first quarter. As a reminder, yield is calculated using current period volume, and as a result, in a declining volume environment, there will be downward pressure on yield, but that does not indicate we are lowering prices. As Jim mentioned, we have taken thoughtful, proactive customer-focused steps to help our small business customers in this tough economic climate and to generate long-term customer loyalty. These actions do not indicate we're abandoning our pricing discipline. We remain committed to recovering the increased cost of our business through pricing actions. While we aggressively address cost reductions related to our volume trends, we also remain focused on meeting our customers' needs. Our operations and customer experience teams are partnered to ensure we can swiftly respond to service increase requests and ramp our operations back up to meet their demands. We've developed a proactive approach to service restorations for customers adversely affected by the COVID crisis. Our goal is to ensure that reinstating their environmental services is seamless, so they can focus on getting their business back up and running. We're in a great position to do this as our 40-hour guarantee was the right thing to do for our team members, allowing us to remove overtime while retaining our frontline employees for the next phase, ramping our operations back up as efficiently and swiftly as possible to meet our customers' needs. In addition, our emerging self-service capabilities as well as the technology on our vehicles will help us support their needs as their businesses come back online. And finally, our recycling business performed well, considering further erosion in recycled commodity prices in the first quarter. Our average commodity price fell nearly 30% to $40 per ton. Despite a decline in revenue of about $60 million in the first quarter, the operating EBITDA contribution from the business increased modestly. These results demonstrate the success we continue to have in restructuring our recycling business to a fee-for-service model. Throughout the COVID crisis, we've been able to continually to safely process most recyclables as we encourage everyone to continue to recycle right. As a result of the demand created for materials we collect, we have seen an increase in OCC prices in April. While we are encouraged by the increase in demand and recovered prices, there are some challenges with other commodities like steel, aluminum and plastics as we've seen the prices for these commodities decline. Despite all these movements and restrictions in the marketplace, our team continues to be able to consistently move all the tons we process. I am proud of how we navigated the COVID crisis, in particular, how we've taken care of our people. This will no doubt help us with employee retention and ultimately help differentiate Waste Management as a great place to work. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Devina to further discuss our first quarter financial results and capital allocation priorities. Maybe, Walter, just a little more color on the landfill side. When we look and we strip it out by waste stream, what we've seen is looks like our landfill volumes on the MSW side bottomed out between like the first and second week of April, and we're starting to see not big improvements, but it's improving week over week. So we are seeing volume come back on the MSW line. Special waste, a little bit later. It looks like it bottomed out in the last week or 2, and that is starting to turn positive. And then lastly, C&D was obviously down pretty significantly, but we've also in the back half of April seen signs that that's flattened and started to turn positive. So there are some signs of optimism in our landfill volumes. And most importantly, the one we pay, obviously, particular attention to is MSW, and we've seen that turn positive here in the last few weeks. Well, yes. I mean, first and foremost, I think our strategy on residential before this pandemic was obviously a focal area for us. We've talked about our plans to improve margins there. And I think if you look at our core price results in Q1, they're strong and stronger quarter-over-quarter from '19 to '20. On the volume side, certainly, we've seen plus-20% increases in the volume on a per-unit basis, and we've kind of broken that down. About 25% of it is open market, and the balance of it really is municipal and franchise business. So we are really focused on going back to all those municipal and franchise customers and having some conversations about what's going on in the volume. I mean look, nobody signed up for 25-plus-or-minus percent increases in residential volumes. And I'm sure, as you folks know and can assume, some of that is going to remain because I think what Jim mentioned in his opening remarks is there's going to be a change in the work environment. And I think we're going to see more people stay and work from home. So we're - that is a key focal area for us. Yes. I mean Jim mentioned it. I think what we saw is it started moderated through the month of April. We had 2 of our areas or regions, depending on how you refer to them, actually show positive coming into the end of the month. And just in the - we're obviously like everybody watching us on a day-over-day basis, week over week. And I would tell you that each day, it's improving over the previous week. As Jim mentioned, it's not huge increases yet. But really, what's important for us is trying to figure out where the bottom of this thing is, and that's what we're focused on, and we feel like we've got a pretty good feel for it right now. Yes. No, fair, Jim. Thanks. I mean we went back and looked, and just under about 10% of our 1.3 million commercial customers have said have had some change in their service. The vast majority, as Jim mentioned, only about less than 1% have actually canceled service. The rest are either reduced or suspended service. And I think what's important to note there is about 80% of those customers came to us as their business has started to decline. But to Jim's point, we've been very proactive with our ops team, our customer experience team to use the tools we have, both on the truck and back in the office to be able to identify and work proactively with these customers. And granted, we might be reducing some yards, if you will, in this example, a little quicker than otherwise may have happened. But listen, this is the - we're playing the long game here. This is certainly about working with our customers, especially the small business customers, through a really tough time. I think the upside for us is that 20% I referred to that our folks identified as service reductions also provide a little risk mitigation because one of the things, we're talking about is what the financial position are these small businesses going to be in the past, et cetera. So what's gotten out in front of this and reducing those yards in a proactive fashion also protects us, we think, a little bit from bad debt and allowances for doubtful accounts in the future. Maybe Hamzah, I'll take the first part of that. I think what we've seen in terms of container weights has been generally commensurate with the volume decline. We've paid a lot of attention not only to the volume and the container, but obviously, the weight per unit because, obviously, as businesses slow down, we're seeing less waste in the containers. So I think overall, what we've seen is volume declines or weight declines commensurate with volume in our front-load containers. Hey, Jeff, I think that one important point that we've all made through this conversation is trying to dictate where the bottom is. And we spent a good bit of time talking around whether it's landfill or collection volumes on some of the positive signs that we're seeing there as we came into the last couple of weeks of April. 14. I think - I think we said 16%, Michael, was the high point. That was the yard exchange. I would say it's improving, although as Jim said, it hasn't been as significant. It's kind of more flat in that. Michael, I also mentioned, though, specific to we're looking at this day by day, week over week, so my comments are really - are that granular as we're looking for the bottom and looking for signs of improvement. But it's only been in the last week or two that we've really seen it bottom out start to show signs of some positive movement. Yes. No, I agree. And as Jim said, I think the big question is what's going to happen in those handful of buckets we spoke to, retail, public sector, et cetera, and how they're - what rate they're going to reopen. Yes, Michael, we looked at it from a revenue and unit perspective. And what we said was is that if you look at office retail, the restaurants and the education bucket, that was about 65% to 70% of where we've seen the degradation in revenue and volume. No. It's still planned. I mean, we have a signed agreement with them and so we're still planning on moving. And I think the interesting part will be, as we look at kind of a new normal with work-from-home, is do we use all the floors that we're committed to? You can imagine that Houston is not a great commercial property market right now, but we would - maybe we sublease out. We're not going to be able to sublease it out for top dollar but maybe we sublease out a floor. It really is going to be dependent on how many of our corporate office employees decide to or we decide that those jobs are better fit in a work-from-home environment. Michael, the last point I'd put on that with regard to 40 hours, the other thing it's going to do is as we start to recover, we've got capacity in this system with those employees where we flex down the overtime. And the thing that's been really interesting, attendance and morale have never been better. And frankly, our safety results have improved and we had a really good first quarter. And we've rolled in April and had even better results in April. You could argue, it's less traffic, all those other things. But I think we're seeing the best out of our employees and they're performing exceptionally well. Yes, Sean. There's been a lot of talk about this urban versus rural kind of math, and we've certainly gone back and looked at it. And the interesting part of it is, is that we can certainly find correlations. You look at places like New York, New Jersey, Seattle that have been hit pretty hard by this pandemic. You can certainly see the impact it's had on volumes there and also maybe a little bit - they're going to be slower to recover, right, because they're still under these pretty strict stay-at-home orders or shelter-in-place. That really has been the learning for us. The learning has been not urban versus rural, but it's been about where have cities where municipalities gone into shelter-in-place orders earlier. And if you look at some of those, they've gone in earlier and that's where we've seen the volume. And I will tell you, we've looked to market by market. And where you would think there'd be a correlation, we've looked on the East Coast, the West Coast, Middle America, and what we have been able to correlate is it's really been about who went out early and how long they're going to stay out. And that's where we really see the shift in volume. It's been less about just strictly urban versus rural. Brian, I would just say we met - we said in the beginning, right now, a little bit less than 10% of our commercial customers, total commercial customers have been affected by this. So it would obviously be a subset, a small subset of that number. So Jim did comment on that specifically, Tyler, in the beginning. And again, we're 7 weeks into this and I don't think there's been anything out of the ordinary that we've observed. I'm not going to comment on what other folks are doing. I can just tell you that whether it's our collection pricing discipline. I spoke to our post-collection pricing discipline. By the way, the cost structure in those spaces has obviously has not subsided so we're going to continue. I think the way to look at this is you just heard the commentary from Jim about the small business. We're going to pause on a subsection of our customers to help them through this tough time. But our strategy around recovering costs to protect, in particular, our landfills and our collection lines of business is not changing. Tyler, I will tell you, you've heard me on the last 4 or 5 calls or since I've assumed this position, that is a focal area for me pre-pandemic. And obviously, we've got additional work to do now that we've referenced some of these container weights. And listen, we also - we're 7 weeks into this so a lot of what we're seeing is we're trying to see, as I mentioned earlier, where the bottom is or where the peak is on disposal volumes. And we're starting to see some signs that's going to mitigate. The real question is, how much is it going to be up permanently and how do we amend our strategy? What I can tell you is before this pandemic hit, we have dedicated resources around the organization that are focused on residential. What we've done is we've obviously had another chapter to their book here, that they've got to go have some difficult conversations with some municipalities. No. I would tell you that where the - the urban markets, obviously, we referenced a few of them where they've gone out earlier and so they got to their bottom quicker. And as I said, we're starting to see a flattening and some slight signs of improvement. In the rural markets, we've also seen some declines. And as Jim mentioned, he referenced a bunch of specific markets we've looked at. And there's no clear correlation that just because one is rural or one is urban, that the volume decline has been faster or longer in between those two. I think what we are confident in is I think we are - have found most of the bottoms and where we haven't, it looks like we're at least at the flat part of the curve. And we're optimistic we're going to start seeing volume increases there in the near term."

Given the significant and widespread disruptions caused by COVID-19, we will use our time on the call to discuss our response strategy rather than focus on first quarter results. Our immediate priorities going into the shutdown were protecting our employees and providing safe and reliable service to our customers and communities. Having established a framework to achieve those early priorities, we're now focused on optimizing our business for the new environment, preserving our financial strength and flexibility and progressing towards closing the acquisition of Advanced Disposal. We're taking steps to use the crisis to create a new normal. We're focused on opportunities to enhance our business, attracting top-quality talent and developing customer-centric solutions. I'm extremely proud of how our team has worked together proactively to address the challenges we faced during the last 2 months and how our frontline teammates continue to diligently provide essential services to our customers. As I've said many times, at Waste Management, we put our people first, so they can take care of our customers, communities and the environment, which will, in turn, benefit our shareholders. It should be no surprise that our top priority as a leadership team has been the health, safety and financial well-being of our 45,000 team members. We wanted to ensure that our employees could focus on continuing to provide exceptional customer service and not worry about whether they'd be able to pay their bills. So the first and probably easiest decision we made was to indefinitely guarantee 40 hours of pay for full-time employees through the duration of the pandemic, so that they know their jobs and pay will be secured even if COVID-19 reduces the number of routes or hours needed to service our customers. Of course, it's important to point out that we took immediate steps to protect the jobs of - while we took immediate steps to protect the jobs of 45,000 employees, we're managing the labor components of operating costs through significant reductions in overtime hours. Regarding health and safety, we're also working with vendors to make sure that we had appropriate personal protective equipment for frontline employees, including masks, gloves and a hand sanitizer. We quickly made strict changes to our daily processes to follow social distancing guidelines for our frontline employees, and we transitioned about 20,000 of our office employees to a work-from-home environment in one week's time. This has been a massive change to how our team performs their jobs, and overall, it's been a very successful transition. We're also providing paid sick leave for our COVID-19-related absences for employees and have extended benefits for backup childcare in light of school closures. The team has responded commendably by continuing to provide essential services to customers and communities across North America. Our team has also been focused on supporting customers, especially small and medium commercial businesses that are the lifeblood of our economies. Even with the substantial support packages, small businesses will certainly need a helping hand coming out of the shutdowns. Given that, we've helped our customers rightsize their service levels, reducing service where necessary, temporarily pausing price increases and extending payment terms. In addition, as I've said publicly, in an effort to support those small businesses, Waste Management is giving a free month of service to qualifying open-market small business customers as they resume their normal waste service and restart their businesses in a post-COVID-19 economy. Our customer teams are proactively contacting these small business customers in an effort to show our support and will continue to do so as states and provinces reopen across North America. We see this as the right thing to do and believe it will result in greater customer loyalty over the long term. We're optimistic that this enhanced customer loyalty, combined with the fact that we've seen less than 1% service cancellations in our commercial line of business since the start of the pandemic, are good signs for how our business will recover as businesses reopen and need our services. We're also working with our municipal customers to address increased residential waste per unit and helping them manage recycling challenges in areas where there have been processing disruptions. Turning to our financial results. For the first quarter, our business generated operating EBITDA of more than $1 billion. For the first 2.5 months of the quarter, our operations were performing extremely well, putting us on track to exceed our first quarter goals. Of course, the whole world changed during the second half of March, and we swiftly began to adapt our business and identify cost-saving opportunities. John and Devina will give more color on cost reductions, but I can assure you that we are maximizing our asset utilization and looking at all discretionary costs and capital spending. Maybe even more importantly, we're looking at this unprecedented event as an opportunity to permanently change our business processes, our customer service offering, our work, our office work model and application of digital business solutions, to name a few. WM has always been a very resilient business model, and we will make sure we come out of this pandemic stronger, more differentiated and even more resilient than we were going in. Finally, it's been about 1 year since we announced our acquisition of Advanced Disposal. Despite the general business disruption caused by COVID-19, we continue to make progress and currently anticipate being in a position to receive final antitrust regulatory approval and proceed towards closing by the end of second quarter of 2020. We're looking forward to completing this transaction, integrating the ADS team and operations and creating long-term value for our shareholders. In closing, despite the fact that solid waste is an essential service and many parts of the business remain recession-resilient, we are suspending financial guidance we provided in February given the uncertainty around the unprecedented impact of COVID-19. At this time, we cannot forecast with reasonable accuracy the duration of the COVID-19 disruptions or the pace of recovery, particularly for small businesses. There are just too many unknowns, and any guidance at this time would be an educated guess at best. Poor short-term visibility does not, however, alternate the very strong cash-generating ability of our business model. In past downturns, we've demonstrated the ability to flex spending, manage capital and maintain solid pricing discipline, all in order to generate strong free cash flow and strong return to our shareholders. We expect to continue to do that in today's economic environment. And most notably, now more than ever has been the right time to stand firmly behind our 45,000 team members and our small business partners to do our part to protect their futures. With that, I'll turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter as well as additional color on the impacts to our business from the pandemic. Yes. I think - Walter, I think the business that we've lost, which John can go into in more detail, it's a very small amount of commercial business that we've lost so far has strictly been due to the pressure of this COVID shutdown, not due to pricing in any way. We have not seen anybody out there slashing pricing. I think most companies are out there really focused on the cost side of their income statement. And I think for us, specifically for all the right reasons, we put our price increase program to our small businesses on hold until they can restart those. I mean as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, small business is truly the group that is at greatest risk here and, hence, our program to try and help them reemerge. But as John said and I'll say, we're not - we've gone for a long time building this kind of price discipline muscle here. And just because it's got a 2-month or 3-month break does not mean it's going to atrophy. We're going to continue to make sure that we increase price to offset cost increases that we've seen and - but we are going to take a break with those small businesses until they get back on their feet. Yes. I mean the - there is a bit of - there is some good news here and - when we look at our numbers. And it's primarily on the roll-off and landfill side of our business. Those, as John mentioned - and good news on the - a bit of reason for optimism on the commercial line of business, although that one is the one that is less clear. We just don't have as good of an idea about what happens with commercial business, what happens with retail, restaurants, all the sporting-related businesses, office space. That is really virtually impossible to predict. There's no historical evidence for us to kind of look back into. But as we just look at our own numbers, I'll give you a couple here with roll-off. And roll-off, as John mentioned, was down, at its low point, in the 20% range. So I'll read off a couple of those numbers, starting with the week of the 15th of March. We were down 4.6%. That's compared to a pre-COVID week just a couple of weeks before but down 4.6%. So all of a sudden, the week of the 22nd of March down 11.6%, down 14.6% the week of the 29th; first week of May, down 17.7%; down 19.6% the week of the 12th. All of that is not surprising, not unexpected and not great. But then all of a sudden, the week of the 19th, so the next week, we went from down 19.6% to down 15.1%. The week of the 26th, we went from down 15.1% to down 11.8%. So a fairly sharp rebound in the roll-off line of business. And when we look at the waste streams within our landfill line of business that are most driven by big business, we're seeing a similar rebound. Where we're not seeing necessarily a big rebound we are seeing some signs that we've bottomed and starting to climb out gradually, and let me stress, gradually, is the commercial line of business because so much of that is driven by small business. And I just think small business themselves don't know what the rebound is going to look like. This is driven by geography. It's driven by mix of business. There - I mean, the small businesses that are tied to health care probably didn't even see a downturn. But a fairly significant percentage of our business is schools, for example. Schools obviously have been shut down. And there's conversation in Houston that they might do every other day in the fall. So we just don't have a good - we don't have good visibility with respect to small business. But the good news is that big business that's not in any kind of liquidity - doesn't have any liquidity concerns or going concern issues, that is starting to rebound. And when we look at those numbers, I just read you for roll-off, it looks encouraging. Well, and John and Walter, the - when John talked about 25% down at its low point for all landfill tons, heavily weighted there with the C&D and special waste, and those are really big customers. Those are big contractors. Special waste is almost exclusively big customers, and they're not going out of business. They just kind of went into a wait-and-see mode. Our pipeline, as John mentioned in his remarks, is strong. And so I think what you're starting to see with that roll-off and some of those waste streams at the landfill returning is big business starting to kind of turn things back on. I think the good news, John, on commercial, and Kyle, the good news on commercial, while we've said there's not a ton of visibility with small business, the good news is that we really have been diligent in trying to determine which customers are not going to make it out of this. And so John talked about that 1%. Well, we've scrubbed that number. That's not just customers calling us and saying, \"Hey, cancel our service. We're not going to continue.\" That is us proactively, through an enhanced process made possible, by the way, through our onboard systems, going back to them and saying, this is a driver, for example, identifying - through an enhanced call process, identifying a customer that looks like the doors are closed. And so - but it's still on their route sheet. And so that would all be included in that 1%. So 1% is a very encouraging number. That tells us that of all these small businesses, the large, large majority are going to try and make a go of this coming out of COVID-19. Now what we don't know is how many of them actually make it. We don't know. I mean you can read 100 articles on what the risk is to small business if this thing lasts 6 months or 12 months. It differs from New Jersey and New York to Texas and Arizona. So the other thing, I think, John, that you were going to touch on was the number of service reductions that we see. Yes. It may - Kyle, it may end up giving - it gives us the best information right now, which actually maybe - may mean the number is a little bit lower for commercial yards because we're proactively addressing it with customers where they haven't reached out to us but where it appears there's a problem. But it also then, once we emerge from COVID-19, will give us a much more accurate number there. We won't be billing somebody with the expectation that we're going to collect and find out after the fact that, \"Uh-oh, they're out of business.\" We believe it gives us a much more accurate number during COVID-19, and then maybe, as importantly, a much more accurate number when we emerge from COVID-19. Yes. Hamzah, with respect to kind of historical downturns, I mean, as you know, I mean, this is not - there's no precedence for this because typically, whether it's '08, '09 or whether it's 2000 or any downturn that you look at, there - the economy starts to - there are signs that this is happening, and the economy starts to ramp down into a recession. There was no ramp-down here. There was no ramp to this. This - literally, in a matter of days, the entire North American economies and the world economies, for that matter, shut down. And so there wasn't a ramp for this, which is - hopefully, we'll never see this ever again, but no ramp. And then the ramp coming out is less about kind of macroeconomics and more about geographies and cities and more about the virus itself and the phases that the White House put out. So it is so hard to know. I mean I would tell you with respect to commercial that we don't - I can't tell you when football stadiums or broadway shows or office complexes, I mean, we're in a Phase 1 status in the State of Texas, but I would tell you, it is a ghost town downtown. So there are no office buildings. They're open, but there's - but our office building here might have, I don't know, 3,000 or 4,000 people in it, and I bet you, there aren't more than 75 people in this office. So - and I just don't know. I couldn't tell you when the Houston Astros or all the little ancillary businesses around the Astros or any other sports team, for that matter, are going to play ball again. Don't know. So it is very, very different and trying to compare it to a previous recession just kind of feels like it's not applicable. Yes. Absolutely, Hamzah. Look, I mean, one of the things that this taught us was that if we really narrow our focus and put our full efforts behind something, we can get it done quickly and we can get it done well. I mean you mentioned work from home. I would tell you, if I'd asked Nikolaj Sjoqvist, our Chief Digital Officer, if I'd asked him back in November, \"Hey, what's it going to take to do a full work-from-home solution?\" I promise you, he would have said 12 months. And we did it in 7 days. So - and we've done it well. We've really - may have been a few hiccups early on, but at this point, we're running smoothly. So to give you a - we did sit down as an SLT and talked about, all right, so let's say we put everything on the table, and then we pick 3 projects that we're going to get done or at least put a huge amount of focus into, and everything else is going to get - put on the back burner. And so what we came out of that meeting with a few weeks ago was a work-from-home solution. The good news about that is we've already invested in the technology. We - there's no pilot involved. We piloted all 20,000 people. So this is really just Tamla and her team making sure that we set up the right performance management metrics and that we look at all of the supervisory considerations and that we consider internal controls and those types of things. That, we expect to be up and running by June 1. We did talk about ERP, and that's something we've talked to you about and talked on this call about. And that was one we felt, look, we have 2 systems that have been - that aren't supported at this point, that are almost 20 years old. We have to move forward with that. That, by the way, is not going to be completed by the end of 2020, but it will stay on the schedule that we laid out, which is kind of a 2022, 2023 completion there for that. So that was number two. And then number three is really a - when we looked at who the winners are coming out of this, and there aren't a whole lot, but if I were to ask you, Hamzah, who's the big winner, not necessarily in our industry but just overall, my guess is that you'd say probably Amazon is a big winner. Well, you're right. Amazon has been a big winner, and then it's because they're the king of self-service. And so how do we digitize our self-service offering? It's something we talked about at Investor Day last May. And how do we expedite that? How do we expedite the digitization, the self-service customer experience and get that done in a very quick but very well-done manner? And that's - and those are really the 3 projects that we identified and said we're going to move forward with all 3 of those, and we're going to expedite it, at least two of them, while staying on schedule with ERP. Yes. I think that - look, I mean, I didn't listen to their call. I mean Republic always does a nice job managing their business, so credit to them for that. I mean I do think we all are facing very similar challenges. I know they're trying to take overtime out, just like we are. We may be handling it slightly differently in some respects. But for the most part, the industry is, I think, doing a really good job of handling this. I do think and I don't know what they said about their commercial business, but I - as I've said several times on this call, look, commercial is - that's the big unknown. That's the question. How are they going to - how are these small businesses going to recover from this? Are they going to recover? How many of them will choose to just throw in the towel? When do all these schools open back up? Do they open back up the same way they went in? I mean we're hearing that - I read an article that said that as many as 40% of outgoing seniors from high school are going to take a gap year. That's going to affect colleges, and that affects our business. So I can't really answer your question specifically about how Republic is doing, managing theirs versus managing ours. I would say that for us, there are certainly some reasons for optimism, which we've gone into, specifically landfill and roll-off, which are really related to big business. But the piece that I think all waste companies are going to really have to kind of get our heads around is what happens to small business because it is unprecedented that you take the entire $23 trillion U.S. economy and shut it down. And so these small businesses are going to be impacted by that. And that's - honestly, that's why we didn't give guidance because we just don't - it's a big piece of our collection. It's a big piece of our disposal. And we just don't have good visibility. We hope that by the end of Q2, enough of these states will be kind of back up and running and into Phases 2 and 3 and on, that we'll be able to give you a better insight into what happened with small business. But I can't really say why their picture was rosier than ours. I can just tell you that I'm feeling pretty good about some parts of our business, and I'm not feeling pessimistic about others. I just don't know. I just don't know about small business right now. Yes, I might just add one thing to that, I mean, look to Devina's point about slowdown of cash payments from customers. I mean that is not in any way surprising to us. I mean, I can't imagine that these small businesses or big business in the month of April are rushing to pay their bill, if they even got their bill, if it went to their office and they're not at the office. So I mean, it's not surprising in any way that you would see that effect from this. And by the way, we think that the Olive branch, I guess, that we're extending to small business will actually have a positive effect on that. We think it's a sign of our commitment to them. And we think that, in return, it's a much easier call for an accounts receivable clerk to call after we've given a free month of service to a small business and say, \"Hey, just want to remind you that you're in your second month coming back. Hope all is well. By the way, you're a little late on your payment. We need to make sure that gets paid.\" That's an easier conversation than if we never changed anything. And certainly, I don't want to be that receivables clerk calling them right now and saying, \"Hey, haven't seen your payment yet.\" They're going to hang up the phone on me. So I think every company will see some type of impact on DSO. I can't imagine a day where you don't see an impact on DSO coming out of 100% economic shutdown. But the goal for Devina and her team is to be in a position to recover that as quickly as we can. And just like pricing discipline, we have working capital discipline here that we will not lose focus on. Well, no, I just said we anticipate being in a position to close by the end of the second quarter. I think it's important to point out that, look, when we first announced this deal, I don't remember the exact day but it was like the middle of April, at 19 or something of - what was it, John? 14. 14th of April, that we said it feels like the 14th of April 1990, honestly, because of this pandemic. But we said that it would take, we thought, between 12 and 15 months to close. We're at 13.5% or we will be, next week, so - or 12.5%. So we're within that window in terms of this being in anticipation or anticipating being in a position to close, so we're not worried about that. By the way, certainly, and I'm not going to blame anything on this pandemic, but look, we were moving 20,000 people to work from home. That included Chuck's attorneys who were working on this. That included DOJ attorneys. Credit to both sides for doing a nice job continuing to work even though we weren't traveling anymore. But no question, there was some impact from COVID-19 on this. We did not contemplate, when we closed this deal, any type of major economic disruption when we went about this in April of '19. Yes, I looked at the number this morning, Michael. I think it was 15.2% this morning so it is improving. I think we've actually had a couple of areas. And I think maybe, John, you mentioned that, but it had gone positive, but it's creeping back. I think, Michael, the - yes, the interesting thing about - particularly about hourly labor and overtime is that we went through a fairly quick but thoughtful approach to the 40-hour backstop that we provided. And I think initially, there was some concern that, \"Oh, my gosh, what are you doing there?\" But interestingly, that has - there's been a pretty minimal cost of that backstop. Recognize what that is, it really is protecting their job, not protecting their paycheck where it was pre-COVID. So all this overtime that John and Devina have talked about, they recognize that, that would come out. As Devina just said, in some cases, drivers are saying, \"You know what, I actually would rather work 44 hours a week as opposed to 53 hours a week.\" So it has been interesting. And I think what we're seeing is that as opposed to just taking a - giving an hourly increase for all hourly employees, which, by the way, is going to be tough to get back once this thing ends, we decided that we would provide a backstop so it protects their jobs. It doesn't protect their pay. And it has been incredibly well received. I mentioned on an interview that - I mean, we've had some people that have sent notes to me that honestly, if they were - it felt like they were crying through their email. They were so happy that they at least knew that I have my job protected. So why don't we move on? We've got - it looks like we still have 6 or 7 folks left. Sure. Why - I'm sorry, say that again. Well, look, I mean, honestly, Michael, we really don't talk about those details on any acquisition, whether it's ADS or a $10 million acquisition. So I mean, I'd love to be able to answer that for you but we just don't talk about those, and we'll talk about that after the fact. Yes. I mean, I think there's been - I mean, we - as John said, we looked at it really market by market. I mean, there are some places where big cities are down less than rural areas. Philadelphia is an example of that, where when I looked at Philadelphia, it was down less than Gilbertsville or Scranton or Harrisburg. So it's - it really is more about the business itself. It's more about the shutdown and it's not just that the urban areas are down more than the rural areas. There are some urban areas that are down more than rural areas such as Seattle. But there are also - I just couldn't find a strong correlation either way, because as I went through probably 7 of our areas, I found big cities that were down more than rural areas, and I found rural areas that were down more than big cities, and there was no rhyme or reason to it other than just business mix. Yes. Boy, that's kind of a big crystal ball question, and I just don't know that I have a good answer for you. Here's what I would tell you as it relates to WM. I mean, I think that clearly, the consumers is going to be heavily impacted by this. My big worry, and this is just my own opinion, my big worry is that if we stay in this for too long, we are going to create some real long-term damage. And look, I'm not being insensitive to - I know you're in New York, and I'm not being insensitive to the people that have been affected by this virus, those families that have lost loved ones, I'm not. I'm just saying there is also a consideration on the other side, which is the long-term impact of this. Not just the long-term economic impact, but the long-term health impact, the long-term impact on things like clinical depression and things like that. So what it - how it relates to our business is that I do think those - this has been a pretty common theme this morning, but those that will be most impacted, the longer we go with this will be those small businesses because they - there was a report out yesterday that said, if this goes 6 months, that 40% of small business could be at risk of closure. Look, that's going to affect us. That's going to affect the Republic. That's going to affect everybody in every industry. I think as we think about our own business, the good news is that we do have a big landfill business that is largely driven by 2 groups, not exclusively, but largely driven by the residential business with third-party MSW and largely driven by special waste and C&D. And as I said earlier, those are big businesses. So I think the landfill business will emerge from this. How fast? I don't know, but it will emerge from this more quickly than other lines of business for us and other industries, honestly. And I think - I would say the same about the roll-off business for us for all the reasons that I just gave. As I've said several times this morning, the one that is going to be the most difficult one to predict is that commercial line of business. And I just don't know what happens with schools, what happens with airlines. And of course, that whole hospitality space is a massive question at this point. Does it ever return to where it was with rental cars and airlines and hotels? So I do think though that as cities and states start to reopen like Texas is reopening. We went to a restaurant on Saturday, pretty full. I mean, not inside. It was outside seating only but pretty full. And so I think you'll - those states that are able, from a health standpoint, to come out and emerge with kind of 2 months of damage, look, I think we can deal with a two month snowstorm. But if this thing is a 9-month snowstorm, boy, that's going to be hard to recover from. So I think the long answer to your very short question, it's really going to depend on these reemergence plans and how quickly we're able to reemerge, and that is going to most impact the commercial line of business. Hopefully, that's helpful. Are you talking about the month of service there, the free month of service? Yes, that's going to show up as price really. And that's why I said I want to caution about what it says with respect to price discipline. I mean, I don't want somebody to freak out in Q2 when we show a price number and it doesn't look very good because we've given a free month of service. By the way, just to give a little bit of context around that. It is not necessarily the month of April. It would be the first month that they come back and reestablish service. So - and it's not all small customers. It is - it's those customers that were forced into some type of impact by this. If your business had no impact, if you're a small health care facility and your business is up or if you're a small grocery store, then you're not - you don't participate in this because you weren't impacted by it. But if you come back and start your business back up as a restaurant, and you previously were 5-days-a-week service or - and now you're going to be 2 days a week, then we give you the 2-day-a-week service for that month in your first month. We're not going to give you a free month and a credit for whatever your bill was back in November. And Tyler, to your second question, I have not - I haven't heard of any small horse throwing in the towel. I mean I think because we're all considered an essential service, my guess is that it's not as if you're going from full revenue to 0 revenue like some of these businesses are. John told me he left his car running in the parking garage and as soon as we're done here, he's heading over to meet with some of our municipalities. That's how urgent this is. I mean, we - half kidding there but half not. I mean, we have to - we - you're right, Tyler. We really do have to look at how - I mean, there's no reason to believe that all of a sudden, we're going to go back to pre-COVID on this. I mean, there are going to be a lot of people that are working from home permanently and waits for the... Yes. I think kind of the same answer there that we gave before in terms of not seeing real trends that were discernible. I mean, I did look again at some data yesterday. I had a look at San Antonio and Austin. Those happen to be two big cities that are not down as much as some of their rural counterparts, at least for us. And so in terms of the bounce-back, because Texas is now in phase 1, I wanted to see whether these cities are coming back more quickly. Houston, which is down more than San Antonio, and Austin, does appear to be, at least for us, appear to have more bounce back to it. And when I looked at Houston versus some of its smaller rural counterparts, yes, I mean, I guess, in some cases, it's bouncing back quicker but it's just really hard to tell because Houston was - is a big city. San Antonio is a big city yet San Antonio was down barely double digits in some of these metrics, whereas Houston was down closer to the numbers that John gave. Yes. Thank you very much, Blue. So lastly, I just want to say, as I always do, thanks to our 45,000 employees who really have continued to represent the best that this company is. And you've heard me speak about this many times. You've heard me speak about it today, but our commitment to putting our people first during this truly, truly unprecedented time has never wavered. And I think it's shown through during this - our leaders certainly have shown up in ways that I honestly had never seen and have really, I think, unified our efforts to just not compromise on our commitments to our people, to our customers and to our shareholders. And with that, I mean, I couldn't be prouder of our management team and of all of our 45,000 people. We're still working through what the new normal looks like, but I can assure you that Waste Management will come out of this stronger on the other side. Thank you very much for your time this morning."

Now I'll turn the call over to Waste Management's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames Fish: All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2021 was another very successful year at WM. Our strong operational and financial performance continued throughout 2021, delivering full year results that achieved or exceeded our financial guidance, which we increased from our original expectations twice during the year. We also successfully integrated the Advanced Disposal operations, generating synergies that have already exceeded our initial expectations with further synergies to come. During 2021, we focused on driving disciplined organic revenue growth, advancing technology investments focused on customer retention and growth and cultivating our people-first culture. Execution on these priorities came together to produce record growth in full year adjusted operating EBITDA and cash from operations. It can't be overstated how impressive it is that we generated more than $5 billion of operating EBITDA in a year like 2021. This robust operating EBITDA translated into all-time high cash from operations of over $4 billion, which allowed us to return a record $2.3 billion to our shareholders. Contributing to our operating EBITDA was our pricing where we finished 2021 on a very strong note as we made steady progress on covering the cost inflation in our business with excellent core price results across all lines of business. John will provide more details here, but we had record core price in both our landfill and residential businesses, 2 areas we've been particularly focused on over the last couple of years. Strong core price translated into the best collection and disposal yield that we've seen in more than a decade. Another great story about our pricing efforts is that we're still seeing strong volume growth and improvements in churn. 2021 churn of 8.4% is an all-time low. As 2022 kicks off, we're fully focused on recovering inflationary cost increases through our pricing programs and through the aggressive management of our cost structure. Our revenue management team is hard at work executing on the 2022 pricing plans so that we can recover the inflationary cost pressures in our business and deliver another successful year. In fact, we've recently seen several large customers who have historically been very price-sensitive, renew at significant increases. On the cost front, a big part of that management of our cost structure will be to materially improve our labor efficiency through the application of the technology investments we made over the last 18 months. Our expectation is to attrit between 5,000 and 7,000 positions over the next 4 years without replacements as these positions have become difficult to source and we expect that will continue to be the case. At the same time, we continue to focus on providing the best workplace for our employees and leveraging our asset network for growth. Regarding our 2022 financial outlook, Devina will provide more details. But at a high level, we expect to deliver total company revenue growth of approximately 6%, driving operating EBITDA growth of approximately 7% in 2022. It's fair to point out that both our revenue and our operating EBITDA guidance are at or above the high end of the ranges we targeted for the long term at our Investor Day in 2019. We expect margin expansion in the second half of the year with full year operating EBITDA margins expected to be flat to up 40 basis points compared to 2021. This sets us up for another year of robust cash generation. The extraordinary cash generation of our business positions us to plan a 13% increase in our 2022 dividend rate, while at the same time, making substantial increased investments in high-return renewable energy and recycling projects. Tara Hemmer was appointed as our Chief Sustainability Officer last summer, and she's charting a path to an aggressive long-term growth for our sustainability businesses. In light of our very strong cash generation, we plan to invest approximately $275 million in 2022 to expand our network of renewable natural gas plants with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $550 million. We expect to build 17 RNG plants over the next 4 years, which would grow our RNG generation by 6x. With conservative assumptions, these projects are expected to generate operating -- annual operating EBITDA run rate operating EBITDA of more than $400 million by 2026. And at today's higher prices, that operating EBITDA more than doubles. In the recycling business, we expect to invest $275 million in 2022 in MRF technology with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $525 million. These investments accelerate our automation of recycling process, processing to reduce costs, improve product quality as well as expand our single-stream recycling footprint. Together, these projects are expected to generate annual run rate incremental operating EBITDA of approximately $180 million by 2026, assuming $125 per ton blended commodity price. These growth projects further WM's sustainability leadership by increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network, expanding single-stream recycling capacity and automating recycling processing to reduce costs and improve product quality. They also are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions. In closing, we delivered a fantastic year in 2021, overcoming the challenges the year presented. As we look ahead to 2022, we remain committed to advancing technology investments that differentiate us, automating our processes to reduce our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Our success would not have been possible without the best employees in the business and I want to thank all 50,000 of our team members for their contributions.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss in more detail our operational results.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim. Hey, good morning, everyone. Our team finished 2021 strong with fourth quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business of 6.5%. Our fourth quarter core price of 6.7% in the commercial line of business and 5.2% in our landfills clearly demonstrate continued discipline and pricing momentum. These strong fourth quarter pricing results were the leading contributors to robust collection and disposal core price of 4.8% for the full year. 2021 yield was also strong at 3.5% and reflects an improvement in rollbacks of almost 500 basis points as well as continued improvement in customer churn. As we move into 2022, our revenue management teams are focused on continuing to recover inflationary cost increases, improving residential profitability and remaining disciplined on disposal pricing. With the strong momentum we have entering 2022, coupled with our team's continued diligence, we expect to deliver core price of more than 5.5% and yield approaching 4%. Shifting to volumes. Fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.8%. For the full year, our collection and disposal volumes grew 3% and service increases outpaced service decreases nearly twofold. Organic growth trends in the first few weeks of 2022 have been encouraging even as some parts of the U.S. and Canada have seen spikes in Omicron cases during January. Commercial yards are tracking above 2021 levels. And while industrial hauls are modestly below last year, we see that as mostly due to weather disruptions in a few areas across the country. Overall, we expect 2022 collection and disposal volumes to grow about 2%, with commercial collection and MSW landfill volumes as leading contributors. Turning to operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 63% with commodity-driven impacts from recycling brokerage rebates and fuel totaling 100 basis points. The remaining increase was related to higher labor costs as overtime increased due to the highest number of COVID-related absences we have seen as well as some risk management costs. During the fourth quarter, our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. And while the impacts of inflation and the tight labor market continue to put pressure on our metrics, there are positive trends in the fourth quarter results that position us well to deliver on our 2022 plan. Maintenance expenses improved sequentially as our continued efforts to standardize maintenance processes, particularly in our ADS locations, is reducing downtime and improving fleet availability. We also saw efficiency, net of incremental training hours, improving all lines of business. We expect these efficiency gains to continue and overtime hours to improve as our teams are taking intentional steps to improve retention, and we see that making an impact as annualized driver turnover has improved every month since August. We estimate that our focus on operating efficiencies and productivity helped to moderate the impact of inflationary cost pressure by about 60 basis points versus the third quarter. So putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve by the second half of 2022. Our collection and disposal business is well positioned to deliver great results in 2022 and so are our recycling and renewable energy businesses. As Jim discussed, our sustainability businesses are central to our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the strong results we're achieving in both the recycling and renewable energy businesses. In recycling, each quarter of 2021 earned a spot among our 5 most profitable quarters of all time, and we're anticipating an equally strong year in 2022. Our current outlook for 2022 is based on an average blended commodity price of $125 per ton, which is modestly above current values of $115 per ton. And similarly, renewable energy business delivered a very strong 2021 results and is expected to match this earnings contribution in 2022 as 2 additional renewable natural gas plants come online. We expect our fifth plant to be operational early in the second quarter and the sixth plant to be online by the end of the year. Our 2022 outlook is based on a RINs price of about $3, which is slightly above our 2021 rate but below current RINs pricing. And finally, our integration of Advanced Disposal continues to go smoothly as we marked the first anniversary of the acquisition at the end of October. To date, we have combined virtually all the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems. And with $36 million of synergies captured during the fourth quarter, we exited 2021 on track to exceed our expectations for full run rate cost and capital synergies of $150 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus on safely and reliably servicing our customers. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead.  I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2021 financial results and 2022 financial outlook in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Our teams worked tirelessly this year to provide essential services to our customers and communities, and we're proud of the results we accomplished together. 2021 operating EBITDA growth of 16.5% was achieved by accelerating collection and disposal core price, capturing robust commercial collection and landfill volume growth, successfully integrating the ADS business and delivering record-high recycling profitability. Controlling our discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions also contributed to the strong EBITDA growth in 2021. In the fourth quarter, SG&A was $481 million or 10.3% of revenue. Our fourth quarter SG&A costs came in higher than our run rate due to the timing of some of our technology- and sustainability-oriented investments. 2021 SG&A was 10% of revenue. That's a 20 basis point improvement over 2020. Over the long term, we target SG&A as a percentage of revenue below 10%, so we're pleased to be nearing that target so quickly after the ADS acquisition. In 2021, we captured SG&A synergies from the acquisition ahead of schedule and started to realize the benefits of our technology investments, particularly by optimizing our sales coverage model, growing our digital sales channel and streamlining the customer setup process. We're confident that our technology investments will continue to deliver value as we differentiate WM and reduce our cost to serve, both on the operating cost and SG&A lines. Fourth quarter capital spending was $774 million, which is above the expectations we had last quarter as we were able to opportunistically accelerate investments in recycling and renewable energy at the end of the year. While we continue to see supply chain constraints, slow delivery schedules and some important traditional solid waste asset categories, we worked diligently to close the year with strong momentum on capital investment to support growing volumes, particularly in our landfill line of business. Growth in both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were particularly strong in 2021. At $4.34 billion, cash flow from operations increased 27.5%, and when excluding the onetime benefit from the required divestitures related to the ADS transaction, our free cash flow grew over 28.5% in 2021 to $2.53 billion. Over the course of the last year, we returned a record $2.32 billion to shareholders, a $970 million in dividends and repurchasing $1.35 billion of our stock. We accomplished all of this while achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75x, demonstrating that we are well positioned for future growth. Moving to our 2022 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth in the collection and disposal business of about 6%, which is the high end of our long-term growth target. This revenue growth outlook drives our 2022 operating EBITDA guidance of $5.325 billion to $5.425 billion, and that represents almost a 7% increase in operating EBITDA at the midpoint. As Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate our cash both to growing shareholder returns and to increasing growth capital investments in our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Setting aside the planned growth investments and focusing on the capital expenditures we plan to invest in the normal course of business, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion in 2022. Free cash flow, excluding these sustainability growth investments, is projected to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. We expect to make approximately $550 million of growth investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects in the coming year. While these investments will be reported as a component of our capital expenditures and therefore reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow, we see these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they will produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. When considering these growth investments, free cash flow is expected to be between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion in 2022. This free cash flow outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $75 million to $125 million and a modest improvement in working capital. Our long-standing commitment to a strong balance sheet and consistent and disciplined allocation of available cash towards growth and shareholder returns continues. Our 2020 priorities will be to invest in the business, grow the dividend, fund tuck-in acquisitions with strong returns and buy back shares. Given the Board of Directors' approval of a 13% increase in the 2022 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.075 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2022 as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2021, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2022 and future years. Our team is hard at work so that we can deliver on our commitments to our customers, communities, the environment and shareholders.  With that, Faith, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Lots of places fruitful for questions, but I guess we should start with the announcement around the increased investments in sustainability. And specifically, I'd like to understand how you're approaching the economics on a long-term basis of these RNG investments. It seems like there is an awful lot of upside and downside in having the economics fairly exposed to the prices of RINs. And given the scale of the investment that you're contemplating and having the exposure through the EBITDA of those RIN prices, how are you thinking about potentially derisking that over time? It does seem like there's a market for long-term contracts in RNG. And while that would significantly haircut potentially the RNG EBITDA versus what you projected, you'd be getting more certainty. So I guess at a high level, how should we be thinking about that and how it impacts the predictability of earnings for the company?\nDevina Rankin: So Noah, I'll start with some comments about how we approach the volatility and then I'll turn things over to Jim so that he can cover the strategic overview with regard to how we're thinking about this portfolio. In the renewable energy space, we currently and expect to continue to manage the volatility by looking both at the very short-term market-driven prices and then long term, those attractive long-term contracts that you mentioned. So we participate on both ends of the spectrum and I would say almost anywhere in between, and we'll continue to assess what's best in order to both reduce volatility but then also optimize the returns of the portfolio and what you can see outlined in the press release that we provided. We're really happy with the return profile and the payback period when you see a 3-year payback period at the conservative levels that we've assumed. That indicates that even with the incremental volatility, we know the returns outpaced the solid waste acquisition returns that we've discussed.\nJames Fish: Yes. And I think just to add to that on the strategic side, Noah, I think there really isn't -- I guess I'll say it this. We have 4 critical capabilities that nobody else has that enable us to really have confidence in these investments. Devina talked about how we mitigate risk. But as we think about them strategically, we have a team that's been doing this since 2015, and they know how to scale these plants across the whole portfolio. We have an asset that nobody else has, which is the amount of gas that we own. Nobody else can bring that to the table. We have the biggest CNG fleet in North America, and that enables us to fully close the loop and leverage the fleet to monetize the RNG. And then lastly, we've got the balance sheet. So if you look at all 4 of those, this made a ton of sense for us to accelerate investments in 2022 out through 2025. I don't think anybody expects that over the next 3 years that we're going to see significant downside in RINs pricing or, for that matter, natural gas pricing. But if there is, we built in pretty conservative estimates and still come up with these very strong returns that Devina referenced.\nNoah Kaye: That's very helpful. And then my second question is just around labor or really around people. You've talked for many years about really making Waste Management an employer of choice not just in the waste management industry but amongst all companies. And now that you're really embarking on a program of attrition and automation and increased efficiency, I guess, how do you approach the challenge at the same time of remaining that employer of choice and continuing to make positions at Waste Management attractive to an increasingly constrained labor force?\nJames Fish: I think you used the right word there, which is attrition. I mean, we're not talking about announcing a big layoff next week. We're talking about using high turnover. This whole Great Resignation as we've heard, we've been talking about that for a while now. And you've heard me talk about my daughter saying in her high school class, nobody wants to drive a truck or operate a piece of heavy equipment. So this is not something that just came to us in the last 3 months. We've been focused on it for a while. We built out those 3 single-stream plants, which we've discussed at length, and those have provided a significant labor benefit to us. So as we started thinking about it more, we saw other buckets of opportunity. When we look at moving, for example, from traditional rear load, we have call it, 3,000 rear load trucks available to shift to ASL. And those rear loaders probably driven more by safety than anything else so it's a safer vehicle at ASL, but there's a labor opportunity there in a category that's very difficult to fill, particularly in today's world. I mean, it's hard to get somebody to ride on the back of a truck and throw trash. So we've got some categories here where we feel like we can really use attrition to our benefit, become much more productive from a labor standpoint. And it's part of why I've maybe never been more optimistic than I am today, coming off of 2 pretty rough years, maybe as rough as any of us have seen in our lifetime and all of a sudden looking at a '22 where we can really start to leverage those investments we've made in technology in those buckets where we have transactional type jobs that are really hard to fill. I don't think this affects what we've tried to do with the culture. The culture is still absolutely being a great place to work. We've done a tremendous amount of benefits, offering to pay for college education for dependents, which I don't think any other company out there does. So we still feel very good about the fact that this is a great place to work. But where we have high turnover, let's take advantage of it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Jim, I'm wondering if you could just expand on the offtake part of the conversation. You just had 22 million MMBtu of gas is going to come online. How much of that do you anticipate going into transportation applications where it will be eligible for RIN 3 credits? And how deep are your conversations with industrial gas customers that won't be using RIN 3 credits? Can you just talk about how that market is evolving and how deep that market might be at this point?\nJames Fish: Might be giving me more credit here on a pretty technical question. I guess I would tell you that -- and I'm not going to give you a very technical answer because I just don't have the expertise. But -- and we can definitely get you an answer on that. But if we look at the -- the 1 thing that I mentioned was our fleet and having that fleet that's 70 -- over 70% of our routed fleet is now natural gas. That number came down a bit when we bought ADS, but we continue to buy 90% of the trucks each year as natural gas trucks. So it does give us a chance to sell those credits and fully close the loop but also paints a nice sustainability picture for us that Tara and the entire WM team are able to leverage. I'm not sure I can answer the more technical aspects of your question there, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight.\nJerry Revich: Okay. And then if we could just pivot and talk about the yield outlook, so nice to see the acceleration for '22. I'm wondering, can you talk about how you expect the cadence to play out? On the last call, you spoke about bigger commercial and industrial price increases coming once we annualize. So does that mean we should look for yield to accelerate as we head through the course of '22, so exit rate higher than 4%? Can you just put a finer point on how you expect that dynamic to play out?\nJames Fish: I think if you look at the year-over-year comps, the comps will certainly be easier purely from a price standpoint in Q1 and Q2. And then we started to kind of get our sea legs a little bit in Q3 and Q4. As we saw inflation, I would tell you that, that inflation that we started to see in Q3 did catch, I think, the entire world off-guard. But nobody expected coming into the year that we'd have 40-year high inflation. So Q3 was playing a bit of catch-up. Q4, we started to really catch up. But there is a lag in terms of how much pricing we can get to cover inflation. And honestly, we probably will be happy just to get to a point where we cover that cost. That's why the labor aspect is so important because we're attempting to raise margins here and add EBITDA dollars. And I'm not sure we do that purely through pricing. In fact, I would argue that pricing, we think, can be the primary offset to inflation. But in terms of adding EBIT dollars and adding margin points, we think the labor piece is a critical aspect of that.  To kind of talk about where it goes for the rest of the year, I mean, I would tell you that -- and I think John and I both talked about it in our prepared remarks, but the fact that we're seeing landfill pricing, and I gave an example of a couple of disposal customers that took pretty substantial price increases, who previously had been very, very price sensitive. And I think they -- that told us that they understood they're seeing inflation in their system. And so we needed to take significant price increases on those big landfill customers. John has talked about residential for a long time, and we're finally starting to see that residential is showing vast improvements on the price front. So I'm happy that we're seeing this across all lines of business. To me, that is maybe the best sign in terms of pricing is that we're seeing this not just in the commercial line of business but we're seeing it across all lines of business and all waste streams. Our special waste, if we look at our special waste and we look at just our baseline, we were up 7.9%, I think, was in our base business, pricing in special waste. And that doesn't really go into our yield number because it tends to be work, but that's a big increase. So we're happy with the progress we're making on price. I don't know that, that really spells out where we're going to be each quarter. Suffice it to say we're going to have easier comps in Q1 and Q2, though.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James.\nTyler Brown : So it looks like margins fell about 140 basis points year-over-year here in Q4. Any way that you could kind of unpack some of the moving pieces? I mean, I think ADS closed in late October, as John mentioned, so that impact seemed to be maybe watered down a bit on a year-over-year basis. And I would think that commodities were a help. Can you just talk about what was really working hard against you?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, sure. So commodities actually worked against us in the fourth quarter by 100 basis points, which is what John remarked to in his prepared remarks. So that's the recycling brokerage part of our business as well as fuel. And we expect that both of those impacts would continue into the first half of 2022. When I look at the remaining components of the fourth quarter, there were about 90 basis points of impact to margin in the quarter that aren't representative of our run rate. And so that's what gives us confidence in our outlook for the 28.1% to 28.5% EBITDA margin in the year ahead. Achieving 28.1% EBITDA margin in this year, integrating the ADS business and having the significant cost inflation that we had in the second half, we're really pleased with. We know that we have additional margin expansion opportunities, particularly with ADS synergy realization that ramped in the back half of the year. So we'll see that continue into 2022. We had some incentive compensation headwinds on a year-over-year basis. Those actually, on a year-over-year basis, were more significant than we expect to be in the way of rollover benefit in 2022. That rollover benefit could be as much as 40 basis points next year. So all in all, what I would tell you with respect to margin, when we compare WM's margin to industry margins, finishing this year at about 30% is a real accomplishment because that's been a target that we've all talked about for a long time. And using both recycling brokerage and the impacts of accretion that are adjustments for the rest of the space, we came in at exactly 30% for the full year and 28.9% for the quarter.\nJames Fish: Tyler, I know you asked a margin question, but I have to say, I guess time will tell whether investors are as optimistic as we are about this. But I got to tell you, I mean, 2021, I mean, I don't need to tell you what it looked like. But at no point in our lives that we've seen in 2021 where we're having hand-to-hand combat with a pandemic and, at the same time, seeing 40-year inflation. And with that, we still raised guidance twice and -- but for a couple of kind of one-timer type expenses, would have finished in the middle of -- almost in the middle of the range for that EBITDA guidance. I was actually stunned that we were able to work our way through 2021.  And then when we look at 2022, looking at our guidance, you remember the Investor Day in 2019 and that's why we referenced it. But putting guidance out there that's at the top end of that range, by the way, if you remember that presentation, we had 3% to 4% inflation in that 2019 presentation when we said that the range would be 5% to 7% for EBITDA, long-term range, and we're coming out with guidance at 7%. And that's off of a -- also the baseline that we raised twice in a kind of a crappy year in 2021. So that's why we're as optimistic as we are, and we'll see whether the market feels the same way.\nTyler Brown : Yes. No, no, definitely strong. But just going back to, again, kind of not to harp on margins, but you talked about them -- it sounded like you were maybe implying contraction in the first half and then expansion in the back. But just for our modeling and so that we can kind of get the quarterly flow right, I mean, should we think something like down 100 basis points in the first half and then up maybe more than that year-on-year in the back half? Or just any color there?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, Tyler. So if you look at the year-over-year comps, Q2 of 2021, in particular, is a really tough comparison because that quarter, we had 29.3% margin. So what you outlined just now is exactly what our projections are. We'll be down about 100 basis points in margin on a year-over-year basis in the first half of 2022 and up 100 basis points to 140 basis points in the back half of the year.\nTyler Brown : Right. Okay, so a great jumping off point to '23. Okay. And then just my last 1 here. On the recycling side, Jim, so the $800 million spend, how much of that is for automation versus new MRFs? And to be clear, the $180 million EBITDA uplift, so $60 million to $70 million of that is from labor savings, is that right? And the other $120 million to $130 million is just from increased material flow?\nJames Fish: Yes, it might be a little bit more on labor. I don't know. We just had this meeting the other day where we talked about how much of this is going to be new plants versus rebuilds. Both of them have really high payback really or really low payback period, really high returns. So they're both great investments. And -- we're -- the good thing is we're not really constrained on -- in terms of cash. So we can probably -- it's less about either/or and more about and. We just want to make sure that we're as on those new markets, we're picking the right markets. I know Brent Bell and his team are looking closely at that. And then with respect to the labor savings, the number that we're giving is -- that we've talked about is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions over about a 4-year period. So if you kind of take the high end of that and you call it, I don't know, let's say, $75,000 all in, and keep in mind, some of these are -- a lot of these are temps, so we get charged a different number than they actually make. So let's say, $75,000 all in, that may or may not be the right number, but you can use that kind of to do the math. And that's probably where most of these [5 to 7] are. We're not talking about $200,000 jobs here. But the high turnover, the high attrition that we see in those jobs really, I think, is -- makes this the absolute right move to move away from those, particularly in a time where we have such a hard time filling those positions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC.\nKevin Chiang: If I could just maybe ask the investments you're making in these high-growth areas. It looks like your renewable energy projects will generate roughly double the returns of recycling. So just wondering, what are the gating factors that wouldn't have you accelerate investments in renewable over recycling? If I just think of $1.01 giving you double the return of the other?\nJames Fish: I think we've given a lot of thoughts on this. I think the cadence that we've laid out internally is the right one. I think we mentioned 17 plants and that's a lot. So these things are complex. There is -- there are some questions, I guess, around supply chain and how much does that lengthen the amount of time that's necessary to build out these plants? But the acceleration, we think, is absolutely appropriate for all the reasons that we mentioned. Do we accelerate it further? I don't know that we do. I think we're -- I think we have the right amount of plants planned in the right places. We've looked at where the right places would be, what landfills will be feeding them, all of that. But I'm comfortable with the plan that we've laid out.\nDevina Rankin: And I think what's important is that the teams that are working on this are independent and not constrained by 1 another, right? So we're able to work on both things in parallel and move 2 really important parts of our business forward simultaneously. And they each have great returns and returns greater than we're even seeing on some of our core solid waste acquisitions, which makes us really confident in making these investments at the same time.\nJames Fish: But Devina, adding $400 million in EBITDA. I mean, and we've talked a lot about that, and that is at these for very conservative numbers. So $400 million EBITDA for the existing plants plus those 17 new plants is a lot. And that's why I mentioned in my remarks that, look, if you extrapolate it out at today's natural gas and RINs pricing, it's not $400 million, it's north of $800 million. So I think the amount of plants that we've planned is appropriate.\nKevin Chiang: No, that's a fair point. The returns across all these projects seem to be very high. Maybe sticking on this topic. If I look at your free cash flow guide, including the spend just over $2 billion, Devina, you talked about targeting just over $1 billion on dividends. You did renew the buyback for up to $1.5 billion. If I put that all together, does that suggest something about the M&A pipeline, that maybe you're seeing either a deceleration in opportunities or maybe the regulatory environment and the DOJ just make it tougher for you to maybe execute on deals or the time line of those deals get pushed out? Just is that something we that we should be reading into based on some of these investments you're making?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. I would tell you that we're certainly not taking our eye off the ball or the amount of focus that we have as an organization away from core solid waste acquisitions. And we're not seeing significant constraints with respect to DOJ pressure or anything like that outside of what we discussed when we were closing the ADS transaction. For us during the integration of ADS, that was the top priority organization, particularly in that part of the country. And for us, that was over half of the areas that we oversee. And so it was really important for us to make that priority #1 from an M&A perspective. The team is definitely looking at the landscape and participating in conversations. As you see some of the smaller players make decisions, we've always talked about the driving forces in their decisions. And this tight labor market has certainly been an accelerant for them. And so we're part of those conversations, still focused on that. We are going to remain disciplined in terms of return. And so buying at the right price is what will be important for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman from Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey, Houston, I hope things are good down there. Can we go back to RINs for a second? Are you taking 100% ownership of the 17 or are you partnering?\nJames Fish: At this point, the plan is 100% ownership of the 17.\nMichael Hoffman: Fair enough. And you can't do a financial hedge on RINs yet? Maybe somebody will figure out how to create that. But in lieu of that, are there other creative ways to develop a hedging approach to the RIN? Because everybody has been alluding to, are you trading 1 volatility for another having fixed recycling to this. So what's the opportunity there?\nDevina Rankin: The opportunity there really is on those long-term contracts that I mentioned earlier, and we continue to work very diligently in that space and have had some good success. And we looked for those long-term contracts to be an appropriate balance to market exposure, so that we do have an appropriate level of volatility without giving up too much of the upside potential.\nMichael Hoffman: How long is long?\nDevina Rankin: Some of them have been more than 10 years and less.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Jim, what's your Washington, D.C. staff telling you about EPA and the messaging they have around the RFS and the RVO? Because that's the greatest point of volatility. If they move that around wrong, that crushes the demand side and you can't control that. So what are they telling you?\nJames Fish: I think our -- the good news is that they have their finger on the pulse up there. It's just the pulse seems to be a little bit erratic, I guess. I would tell you that areas like CCRs, I mean, coal combustion residuals, which have been discussed within the EPA longer than some of the other items. That is an area that we really see the opportunity starting to develop. And we like -- the pipeline is kind of 40 million-ish tons over $1 billion for us in the next 4 years. And then things like PFAS. PFAS is -- we've always talked about that as an opportunity for ourselves. But there's a lot that is being discussed. I'm not sure we've seen the full consensus maybe is the best way to put it on a lot of those topics, with the exception maybe of ash and some of those have been talked about longer.\nJohn Morris: I think, Michael, the other thing we're watching is a small refinery exemption, right, because that's also been part of what's in that market. And there's been some commentary there. There's nothing decided yet, but to the extent that, that they extinguish some of the exemption there, I think that obviously bodes well.\nMichael Hoffman: Well, and the good news is in December, EPA set an outlook for '22 and '23 that seem to recognize, don't compromise whatever you do with the exemptions by setting too many -- [the numbers too]. That seems to send a good signal for at least the next 2 years. If we could shift to price, what's the early reaction to the 5.5 average core price? A year ago at this time, the customer was taking more price, and we ended up with a better outlook on price. What's the current early reaction to the 5.5?\nJames Fish: I think the -- probably the best indicator would be in our churn numbers. I mean -- and I mentioned the churn was at an all-time low there. So I think the reaction is that people understand that inflation is real, that it's out there in the economy and that we're being judicious about how we apply it, but we're attempting to recover our costs. And look, that's been no easy task. We've seen a pretty heavy hit from labor inflation, particularly in Q3. That started to come back down the north a little bit in Q4, just simply because we've taken a lot of those adjustments already. But I think, John, the number was almost $100 million in adjustments for 2021.\nJohn Morris: Yes, slightly over.\nJames Fish: Yes. So I think the reaction has been reasonably accepting, Michael.\nJohn Morris: I would add, Michael, too, that our most labor-intensive line of business, Jim talked to the automation benefits and the path we're pinning down with regard to residential. But you've seen the sequential improvement in residential core price and yield. You've also seen some of the volume degradation. We're going to continue to be selective there, especially in this kind of labor environment, which we don't see as short term. So we look at that price and labor trade-off as good for the shareholders.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And so if I then look at the volume side, would you say you're still seeing new business growth helping that? Or is this still mostly service interval upgrades of existing?\nJames Fish: I think it's some of both, right? John talks a lot about service increases versus decreases. There's -- I think it's almost like by a factor of 2 higher on service increases. So it's a bit of both, Michael. I mean, I mentioned probably the most forward-looking volume that we have, the revenue stream that we have would be in special waste. And I think what that portends for the economy is a good -- is that we don't see a big downturn in the economy coming even with the inflationary pressures. Our special waste pipeline looks really good. Our special waste in Q4 was really strong. And so the only areas that we saw that were weak were really driven by difficult year-over-year comps. I mean, roll-off volume was flat. But it was not because we're -- it wasn't something for us to be concerned about simply because 2020 had a lot of fire volume in Northern California and also a lot of -- you remember the late hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast last year. And so there was a lot of volume from that. So without that, we would have seen a much more positive number in roll-offs. I think volume looks to be a bit of both of those, still kind of an emergence from COVID and which is kind of the service increase, service decrease piece, but also growth of the overall economy.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then to clarify the M&A question, how would you frame the corporate development pipeline? Is it busy? And is it a reasonable -- you're not modeling this, but is it reasonable to think that you can participate in the ongoing consolidation at 1% or 2% rev growth, which is a little less than the underlying organic growth of the industry?\nJames Fish: I think we'll always focus on -- we'll always have our eye on M&A. And where there's opportunities, we'll try and take advantage of those. But at the same time, we don't want to overpay for these so we're careful there. But it doesn't look like the M&A landscape has changed that significantly. But we just felt like, as we looked at somewhat of a capital allocation decision here with respect to these big incremental investments in renewable natural gas and in recycling, that the returns on those were better than the returns for solid waste acquisitions. And while the cash generation of the business has been tremendous, it's not an infinite bucket. It's a finite bucket. And so therefore, we feel like we will invest more heavily there. But again, with M&A, to the extent that an opportunity arises and we feel like it builds a gap, we'll explore it.\nDevina Rankin: And then, Michael, on -- from a planning perspective, our 2022 guide does not include any rollover benefit from M&A. The solid waste acquisitions were only about $40 million in 2021 and divestitures actually had a larger impact. So from an outlook perspective, the '22 guide doesn't contemplate anything from acquisition contribution.\nJames Fish: I mean, that's a great point, Devina, because when I -- I've talked about that 7% EBITDA growth number at the high end of that long-term range. But that is almost 100% organic. I mean, we're not talking about a big rollover from acquisitions. We had very little in the way of acquisitions, solid waste type acquisitions in 2021. So that 7% is in the face of still pretty significant inflation, but it's at the high end of that range, which is why we're talking about it.\nMichael Hoffman: So you've mentioned 2019 several times. The world's changed a lot since 2019. Do the assumptions need to be revisited?\nJames Fish: Well, we'll see. I mean, you might argue that the assumptions need to come down after the last 2 years. But yes, I mean, at Investor Day in 2019, we talked about what the world has been for the last 3 or 4 years, 4 or 5 years even, and which was pretty low inflation. So we built low inflation into those EBITDA and revenue ranges. We may decide after 2022 or 2023 that the world has changed sufficiently enough to have another Investor Day and to talk about different ranges.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Last 1 for me. John, you've been focused diligently for a couple of years now improving the resi margins. What's left? Is there much left or are you pretty much done that and now it's just maintaining?\nJohn Morris: We're not done, Michael. I mean, I think when you think about this labor environment, right, from where we started to talk about the world changing a lot, well, the labor world has changed a good bit. We talked about that in our prepared remarks and a bunch of the question-and-answer period. So I would tell you that the goal line there has moved a little bit, right? The rate -- the labor intensity of that business is higher than the others. We still have automation opportunities there, and the margins there are still not competing with commercial and industrial. So as much as we've made terrific progress, we've seen some additional pressure, especially in the back half of the year on wages inflation, if you think about the impact of Omicron in Q4, I mean, all those things, I think we still have a good bit of opportunity there.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kyle White from Deutsche Bank.\nKyle White: I wanted to go back on -- you talked a little bit about in terms of the special waste pipeline. But I just wanted to take a step back and talk more broadly about the economy at a high level and what you guys have seen. Obviously, a lot going on with the market but housing is doing well, while maybe consumer sentiment spending is weakening. Maybe just any notable details that you could point to at a high level how it impacts your business, given that you have exposure throughout the broader economy.\nJames Fish: So Kyle, I think the challenges that we're looking at in 2022 are largely going to be inflation and maybe, to a lesser degree, this labor challenge that it feels like a long-term challenge and hence, the need to really become more productive from a labor standpoint and then the 5,000 to 7,000 positions that will attrit away from the business that we plan to replace the technology. By the way, what I didn't mention is we saw some add in 2021. We've talked a lot about these investments we've made in customer service digitalization. And so in 2021, as maybe somewhat of a test case, we fully automated our customer setup function. It was not a huge number of jobs. It was maybe 200 jobs, so about $7 million in savings. We did something similar with some of our -- we call it sales optimization. So we've gone through a piece of it and then, of course, some of what we saw with recycling. We've gone through a piece of it. But I would tell you that in general, we see and we hope to see 2022 be a much quieter year than the last 2. Hard to be no easier than the last 2, I guess.\nKyle White: Yes, we'll see. Time will tell. In terms of the rise of Omicron late in the quarter and into January, did you see any impact on your volumes from this? I think in the prepared remarks, you mentioned maybe, I think Canada, I know it's a small exposure, but just any impact from the rise in Omicron?\nJohn Morris: Matt, it was -- yes, it was really spotty. I mean, it wasn't -- it was more of an impact on our overtime and our ability to service our customers. There were a few pockets. You referenced Canada, where it's been a little bit of a unique circumstance up there in eastern Canada. A little bit of volume impact there but generally speaking, no.\nJames Fish: We did see -- we talked about the fact that we had as many -- I think the number we gave was 800 employees in Q3 at the peak who are out with either the virus or some exposure. And so therefore, they were quarantined, so 800 out of 50,000. Omicron, fortunately, it seems less serious but definitely more contagious. And so -- and that showed up in our numbers. The peak was 1,500, and probably John, half of those were drivers.\nJohn Morris: More than half.\nJames Fish: More than half. So if there was any good news about it, it was that it happened in kind of December, January, which are slow volume months for us as opposed to the peak from Delta, which was in August, and early September, and those are our peak months for us in terms of volume. But right now, we're seeing those numbers come back down pretty dramatically.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Hamzah Mazari from Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: My first question -- and I know you touched on the margin side, but I just had a follow-up on just operating leverage. As you had said, right, you hit 30% margins but basically, margin expansion still seems pretty low relative to high single-digit organic growth. Could you maybe just talk about is -- and I understand labor inflation, et cetera, could you have been more aggressive on pricing earlier on the discretionary side? I know the CPI site sort of resets kind of first half, second half. So that's kind of point 1. And then second point, is your labor turnover higher than your peers because it seems like your peers are getting margin expansion on similar organic revenue growth. So I'm just curious whether you could have been more aggressive on price earlier or whether your turnover is higher. I know you're a much larger company.\nDevina Rankin: I'll start on the margin commentary. Pricing, I think, with respect to our pricing activities, what you saw was a much more significant and acute change in the cost environment in the third quarter across the U.S. economy, right? Whether or not our competitors saw those impacts, I observed their third quarter results as well. And so what I would tell you is that what we saw is that we were taking active steps with our employee base to be sure that we were curbing the impacts of turnover that were happening across the economy. From a margin perspective, I definitely don't think that you should take away from our 2020 results any indication of a plateau. Instead, what we know happened in 2021 is 2 things: one, we were integrating the ADS business, which has a 400 basis point lower margin base than the WM business. And so we knew that would have pressure on our margins coming into the year. And then secondarily, we saw that acute labor inflation cost hit us in the third quarter with a very prompt response really late in Q3, early in Q4 from a pricing perspective that you saw provide really good margin cover in the fourth quarter to the point earlier, that provided about 60 basis points, both from a price perspective and efficiency perspective benefit on a sequential basis going from Q3 to Q4. And we think some of that sequential improvement continues into Q1, where pricing activities will continue as we've mentioned before.\nJohn Morris: I was just going to say, so I think if you heard what Devina commented on earlier about how we'll see that margin improvement kind of in the back half of the year. But if you assume that we'll see some margin pressure in the first half and you do the math to get to the second half of the year, I think it really gives you a certain level. It tells you about our level of confidence about what's going to happen with margin. I think on your CPI point, I mean, we think about 2.5% is what we're going to see for the full year next year. And as Jim mentioned earlier, some of that -- a good chunk of that comes is in the residential revenue line, and we see that the biggest lift for residential in July.  As far as turnover, I can't comment on the others. What I can tell you is we've had a very concerted effort and process that we've put in place. We are pleased with what we're seeing. It's obviously not a trend you fix overnight. But since August, we've seen improving acquisition and retention numbers. So when you look on a net basis, we are making headway in terms of those we're bringing on and those we're retaining.\nJames Fish: I think -- I mean, Hamzah, real quick, first of all, with respect to turnover, I don't know what the other guys' turnover is, I can't really compare. I would tell you if they're not seeing any inflation in their business, then they're operating in Antarctica because the whole world is seeing inflation. And regarding pricing, our core price is 5.2% for Q4. And you might say, well, you guys aren't very good at covering inflation because inflation was more like 6% for us and we were only showing 5.2% core price. We're not getting there. But as we talked about, there is a lag. Could we have been more aggressive? I don't know. I mean, boy, this thing came out of nowhere. I don't think anybody expected it. So I'm happy with the progress we're making. We've made a ton of progress sequentially between Q3 and Q4, and we'll continue to see that in 2022.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Very helpful. And my follow-up question is on the investments, more specifically around execution risk. You have the 17 RNG plants. I think you said you're going to take 100% ownership. Do you have the bench strength and engineering talent to sort of execute on that? I'm assuming you're not JV partnering on this. You mentioned a bunch of accelerated recycling and automation investments too. Again, great paybacks and you mentioned the EBITDA ramp. But just help us think through execution risk. I know historically, Jim, when you were CFO, WM had made a ton of investment. I guess this was a long time ago, right, waste-to-energy, ethanol plants, oil fields. Then the company sort of refocused back to the core, and now this is sort of a new phase of investment but it is definitely very much sort of in your core wheelhouse, RNG, recycling, et cetera. But just help us think through execution risk as you execute on all these different initiatives going forward.\nJohn Morris: So Hamzah, I'll start with recycling. I mean, if you look at where recycling was 3, 4, 5 years ago, we charted a path to make that business compete from an investment and return standpoint with other lines of business. And even with the commodity tailwinds, even when you look at commodities were down, we were improving the returns on the margin on that business. And then if you look forward, I don't think we have a -- we have total confidence in our ability to execute on the recycling side. I think we've demonstrated that even when commodity prices were not the tailwind they were with the fee-for-service model, we've talked about. So I think we've got back steps on the recycling side. In terms of the team, we have in place to be able to build and operate these recycling plants. We're the biggest recycler in North America and we do -- I like to believe we do this better than everybody else. On the WM RE side, I think what Jim said is right now, we're assuming 100% of the risk. We've got optionality and Devina talked to some of the other backstops we could potentially put place down the road in terms of the commodity risk. In terms of the execution, Jim mentioned we have the fleet and we have a team that's been in the RNG business for a bunch of years right now. So to me, this is less about execution risk. It's really just about, given Tara and that team the resources they need to go faster.\nJames Fish: I mean, there's been no shortage of potential suitors, Hamzah, on the RNG business for us. But at this point, we feel good about doing it on our own. But we have -- we still have optionality.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And by optionality, you mean that you could potentially bring in somebody, is that what you mean?\nJames Fish: If we wanted, sure. I mean, one of the assets that I talked about, 1 of the 4 things we bring to the table is the asset itself. And we have more landfill gas than anybody else. And so those 4 things I think are really what differentiates us in this foray into RNG that we think is going to be hugely valuable for us that we talked about 400 million at very conservative numbers, could be as high as 800 or more. So we like our position. But yes, that's the answer is that optionality means if we wanted to partner up with somebody, we could.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: So you likened the growth initiatives to acquisitions and also kind of framed it as growth. And my question, I guess, is on how much, and I'm going to use the word cannibalization, but it's probably -- it's not the right word for it, but how much to the extent that you might have invested in either growth CapEx over the next 4 years or your investment in acquisitions over the next 4 years might have come from or been impacted by your decision to deploy capital in these areas? Were they at all affected? Or is this something that is completely 100% incremental and therefore, capital that, let's say, would have gone back to investor returns is now because of the return potential is now being allocated to this. Is it complete? In other words, do we open our models, our long-term models? Do we add that EBITDA dollar -- the complete level of dollar EBITDA to our year for those years, those out years? Or is this something that might have been also built into what we would have otherwise modeled in terms of M&A and/or growth CapEx?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So the easy answer here is that it's not a trade-off for us. So this is not taking the place of some other investment that we otherwise would have pursued way of growth or M&A. For us, this is incremental. And for that reason in terms of how you think about it in looking at our long-term growth outlook, this is incremental to that long-term growth outlook that we've outlined.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. That's fantastic. I appreciate that. On the customer -- on pricing and the impact on customer churn, every day seems to be a new day in terms of how -- what the level of pricing is that's passed on. My question is, is there any incremental change even as of -- as we enter the new year, as you go back to those customers with the price increases, as fluid as it seems to be that all sectors and all services and all goods manufacturers seem to be able to pass on price, is there any level of churn that is coming little more than expected? Is there any behavior among your competitors that's shifting at all, again, not so much in the fourth quarter, but in recent trends that would suggest that customer churn may be picking up a little bit here with the higher pricing?\nJohn Morris: I would tell you, Walter, as you look at our momentum into Q3 and Q4, what we see in the outlook here, and we've talked about for 2022. And believe me, I asked that exact question of our revenue management team about once a week. And the short answer is no. I think the receptivity of just about all of our customers, they understand that inflation is real, that it's not going away. And we're trying to be thoughtful about it. One of the comments I didn't make to Hamzah's question was really trying to take our customer lifetime value view of our base and being -- obviously, we have, as Devina said, some acute inflationary headwinds that took everybody a tad off-guard. And while we're doing our best to recover that as quickly as we can, we're also -- this is also the long game, too. And I think that's when we're going through the model and customer lifetime value is certainly something we're factoring in there. And I think you're going to see that continued momentum throughout '22. I don't think from a -- I haven't seen -- other than what I commented on some of the selective revenue decisions we're making in residential, the receptivity of the customer base has been pretty consistent.\nJames Fish: I think also, Walter, worth mention here, I honestly can say I have no idea what the competition is doing other than what they publicly talk about on their calls. So it's not something we really pay attention to. We have a certain cost structure that we're trying to cover, and so that's how we focus our pricing.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. My question on competition is at the ground level, are you seeing competitors taking customers with a little less price than you're bringing on the table? But it sounds like that's not the answer. I really appreciate -- yes, go ahead.\nJames Fish: It's always a competitive business. So I mean, are there competitors out there that are taking customers? It's a very competitive business. We have cities where we have a dozen competitors or more. So I think the answer to that is, yes, that's just part of what we deal with day in and day out. But I don't I don't really focus on it because I feel like we are -- we have a really solid, robust plan in place with respect to all of these financial aspects and pricing is a big contributor.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: So you guys have said previously sort of that 50% free cash flow conversion is a sustainable level? It looks like you're guiding to close to that in 2022 when you back out the accelerated investments. So I'm just trying to think longer term, going into 2023, do we think about 50% underlying conversion and then maybe assume sustainability investments remain elevated? I mean, any kind of color on where that $550 million goes and that underlying sustainable conversion rate would be helpful.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. Sean, that 50% target remains our goal, and we were happy to accomplish that in 2021. And you're right, from a guidance perspective, we're kind of right at the bottom end of that targeted range. When I look at the longer-term outlook, you're exactly right from a sustainability project perspective. With the outlook we gave for 2023 through 2025, you can expect that, that elevated level of growth investment will continue through that period. And that would be treated similarly to how we provided our guidance in 2022. When I look at the contributing factors, we think that there's more work that we can do on working capital optimization. EBITDA growth continues to be that long-term outlook of 5% to 7% that we've talked about. So we'll certainly continue to revisit that as we see different factors contribute to both the headwinds and tailwinds of the business as appropriate. So one, I can't really comment on because it remains a big question mark, and we can't predict it is the future of cash taxes and whether it be the corporate tax rate or look at bonus depreciation impacts. Those things could put some downward pressure, and that's just too hard for me to predict with regard to the things that we can control, we're going to continue working to not just hit that 50% benchmark but try and improve it from here.\nJohn Morris: It also depends, too, right, Devina, on the free cash flow. Obviously, the piece is 1 of the 2 numbers there. And if you look at our free cash flow, excluding those growth types of investments, then your ratio is right at 50%. If you look at the way we define it, which is pulling CapEx out and this is -- as we've talked a lot about today, those growth investments in RNG and recycling, we're essentially kind of making a capital allocation decision and spending extra CapEx. So the free cash flow guidance that we're giving is technically in that $2 billion-ish or a little bit more than that range. If you use that number to calculate the ratio, then it ends up being under 50%. If you use that the free cash flow number that we typically would report as a range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, then you're talking about something that's 50%. So there is a little bit of math in that, that needs to be understood.\nSean Eastman: And just shifting over to the technology investments. Just in the context of WM\u2019s other levers to combat cost inflation beyond the pricing programs. Obviously, you talked a lot about automation, we've got the back office, IT efficiencies. How is that reflected in the 2022 margin guidance? And I guess, I'm trying to just think about the juice you guys have there going into 2023?\nJohn Morris: I think, Sean, I think, Jim, we all spoke to it. I mean, it's about making the labor pool that we have more efficient, right and using technology to replace some of these transactional jobs. And frankly, we're having a hard time filling. But that's where the operating side. If you look at it from a revenue side, we've talked a lot about the technology we've installed in our operations. And one of those is the technology we put on trucks. And if you look at service increases and decreases, some of the revenue growth we're seeing in commercial in particular, we think technology is part of the reason that's happening. We've automated a lot of those processes, where the folks behind the wheel don't have to worry about whether they have to take a picture, send the picture and that's all done with the technology and data and that analytics team we have. So it's not just the operating side, we are also seeing -- the investments we've made in what we call smart truck, as one example, sales coverage optimization, which is really about getting more efficiency out of our sales force, which I think is also contributing. Those are a couple of examples where the technology is actually helping directly on the top line.  In terms of the margin, juice. \nDevina Rankin: Yes, I\u2019d tell you, when we look at margin, the one place in the business that we specifically see technology showing up other than what John has already mentioned particularly on the top line is on the SG&A side and our SG&A margin for 2022 are expected to be below the 10% that we accomplished in the current year. \nJames Fish: One last thing here. And I know we're a little bit of a long winded answer here. But to John's point, he talked about our data and analytics. So our team our data and analytics team is in the process of fully optimizing, they're working on a specific line of business. So fully optimizing roll up line of business and the number of permutations there, there's a massive amount of data, they built an engine there. And now they're in the process of kind of rolling this out over a period of months, but it will fully, fully optimize the ultimately all collection lines of business. Right now we're working on roll up but imagine all the data that goes into this is got road information, it's got driver data, it's got traffic, it's got customer data, containers, all kinds of stuff. The number of calculations is a ridiculous number. It's got like 17 zeros behind it. So it's a ridiculous number. But what it does for us is get to a point where we can fully, fully optimize these lines of business, and then you start talking about it the way maybe an Amazon talks about it and probably nobody else with respect to optimizing these routes.  We think there's a huge productivity take-up there. So what we haven't talked about are some of the driver turnover that we'd love to be able to take advantage of it. And this is one of those avenues. \nOperator: Your next question is from David Manthey from Baird.\nDavid Manthey: You've covered a lot here. But just a question on recycling automation investments. What percentage of your recycle volumes are processed by your single stream facilities today? And then what would that be by 2025? And just if I can understand, do these investments include adding more facilities? Are they just about expanding capacity and improving productivity of the existing 49? \nDevina Rankin: So we'll get you the information and Ed and Heather will be sure to circle back with you in terms of the percentage of our tonnage covered by the single stream network. Sorry, we don't have that at our fingertips. But with regard to the investments that we're making, it's more heavily weighted toward automation, but we will be exploring new markets and expanding our single stream footprint into markets that we don't currently serve. \nJames Fish: Some of the new market investments as we heard David there in our internal meeting was that it might be a city where we don't have a presence, but we do have a presence in a city that's 150 miles away. And we feel like the better of the two would be actually to go to the city to the South, and close down the facility in the city to the North. So there is a bit of a strategic decision there too. It's not always just where do we have underserved markets and how do we add capacity there.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Feniger: Hey, guys. I know it's been long, so I'll just ask a quick one. When we think of your core price of 5.5 and the yield of 4% for '22, that's very strong. Can you just help us, what's embedded for the cost inflation for 2022? Jim, in Q3, you gave us great color around the acute inflation. You mentioned, I believe it was like 7% on some lines of business. I'm just curious what that should look like year-over-year, as we think of 2022 versus 2021? Thanks.\nJames Fish: The 4% to 5% inflation is what we built in Michael. So -- and that's why we think that we do get to a point where we are able to cover that with pricing. And then a lot of the margin growth comes from places like automation and removing some of these transactional type positions. \nMichael Feniger: Got it. And just lastly, Jim, just on the CPI side, it depends on when you look at CPI because you can get half the year of the COVID type of CPI while the other half of this really high inflation CPI print. So I guess, just when I think about CPI running through your book of business, is it mostly really second half-second half or even like a 2023 is when we'll see these like really robust CPI print kind of come through the system? What's the timing on that?\nJames Fish: I think you nailed it there, Michael. It really is probably second half of '22. There's a lot of these, as we've discussed, a lot of these contract adjustments have a 12-month lookback. So it won't fully capture this pretty aggressive ramp-up in inflation until we get to July or even January of next year. You may recall we've talked about almost 70% of the adjustments that we take happen in the front half of the year. And so the ones that we just took in January, which I forget what the exact percentages are, but the big 2 months for adjustments are January and July. And what we just took in January, to the extent that there's a 12-month lookback, it's not going to include a whole lot. It's going to include maybe 3 months of the big inflation ramp. Next year, it will include 12 months. And so the farther we get into -- the deeper we get into the year with these adjustments, the more they will include this big ramp-up in inflation.\nOperator: There are no questions over the phone. I will now turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames Fish: All right. Well, thank you. Long call today, but I think, hopefully, you felt we gave some good details. Thank you all for joining us. We're very excited about finally coming into a year where it feels like we're going to have a bit quieter year. And so thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you out on the road.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. Our teams worked tirelessly this year to provide essential services to our customers and communities, and we're proud of the results we accomplished together. 2021 operating EBITDA growth of 16.5% was achieved by accelerating collection and disposal core price, capturing robust commercial collection and landfill volume growth, successfully integrating the ADS business and delivering record-high recycling profitability. Controlling our discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions also contributed to the strong EBITDA growth in 2021. In the fourth quarter, SG&A was $481 million or 10.3% of revenue. Our fourth quarter SG&A costs came in higher than our run rate due to the timing of some of our technology- and sustainability-oriented investments. 2021 SG&A was 10% of revenue. That's a 20 basis point improvement over 2020. Over the long term, we target SG&A as a percentage of revenue below 10%, so we're pleased to be nearing that target so quickly after the ADS acquisition. In 2021, we captured SG&A synergies from the acquisition ahead of schedule and started to realize the benefits of our technology investments, particularly by optimizing our sales coverage model, growing our digital sales channel and streamlining the customer setup process. We're confident that our technology investments will continue to deliver value as we differentiate WM and reduce our cost to serve, both on the operating cost and SG&A lines. Fourth quarter capital spending was $774 million, which is above the expectations we had last quarter as we were able to opportunistically accelerate investments in recycling and renewable energy at the end of the year. While we continue to see supply chain constraints, slow delivery schedules and some important traditional solid waste asset categories, we worked diligently to close the year with strong momentum on capital investment to support growing volumes, particularly in our landfill line of business. Growth in both cash flow from operations and free cash flow were particularly strong in 2021. At $4.34 billion, cash flow from operations increased 27.5%, and when excluding the onetime benefit from the required divestitures related to the ADS transaction, our free cash flow grew over 28.5% in 2021 to $2.53 billion. Over the course of the last year, we returned a record $2.32 billion to shareholders, a $970 million in dividends and repurchasing $1.35 billion of our stock. We accomplished all of this while achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75x, demonstrating that we are well positioned for future growth. Moving to our 2022 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth in the collection and disposal business of about 6%, which is the high end of our long-term growth target. This revenue growth outlook drives our 2022 operating EBITDA guidance of $5.325 billion to $5.425 billion, and that represents almost a 7% increase in operating EBITDA at the midpoint. As Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate our cash both to growing shareholder returns and to increasing growth capital investments in our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Setting aside the planned growth investments and focusing on the capital expenditures we plan to invest in the normal course of business, we expect capital spending to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion in 2022. Free cash flow, excluding these sustainability growth investments, is projected to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion. We expect to make approximately $550 million of growth investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects in the coming year. While these investments will be reported as a component of our capital expenditures and therefore reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow, we see these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they will produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. When considering these growth investments, free cash flow is expected to be between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion in 2022. This free cash flow outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $75 million to $125 million and a modest improvement in working capital. Our long-standing commitment to a strong balance sheet and consistent and disciplined allocation of available cash towards growth and shareholder returns continues. Our 2020 priorities will be to invest in the business, grow the dividend, fund tuck-in acquisitions with strong returns and buy back shares. Given the Board of Directors' approval of a 13% increase in the 2022 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.075 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2022 as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2021, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2022 and future years. Our team is hard at work so that we can deliver on our commitments to our customers, communities, the environment and shareholders.  With that, Faith, let's open the line for questions. So Noah, I'll start with some comments about how we approach the volatility and then I'll turn things over to Jim so that he can cover the strategic overview with regard to how we're thinking about this portfolio. In the renewable energy space, we currently and expect to continue to manage the volatility by looking both at the very short-term market-driven prices and then long term, those attractive long-term contracts that you mentioned. So we participate on both ends of the spectrum and I would say almost anywhere in between, and we'll continue to assess what's best in order to both reduce volatility but then also optimize the returns of the portfolio and what you can see outlined in the press release that we provided. We're really happy with the return profile and the payback period when you see a 3-year payback period at the conservative levels that we've assumed. That indicates that even with the incremental volatility, we know the returns outpaced the solid waste acquisition returns that we've discussed. Yes, sure. So commodities actually worked against us in the fourth quarter by 100 basis points, which is what John remarked to in his prepared remarks. So that's the recycling brokerage part of our business as well as fuel. And we expect that both of those impacts would continue into the first half of 2022. When I look at the remaining components of the fourth quarter, there were about 90 basis points of impact to margin in the quarter that aren't representative of our run rate. And so that's what gives us confidence in our outlook for the 28.1% to 28.5% EBITDA margin in the year ahead. Achieving 28.1% EBITDA margin in this year, integrating the ADS business and having the significant cost inflation that we had in the second half, we're really pleased with. We know that we have additional margin expansion opportunities, particularly with ADS synergy realization that ramped in the back half of the year. So we'll see that continue into 2022. We had some incentive compensation headwinds on a year-over-year basis. Those actually, on a year-over-year basis, were more significant than we expect to be in the way of rollover benefit in 2022. That rollover benefit could be as much as 40 basis points next year. So all in all, what I would tell you with respect to margin, when we compare WM's margin to industry margins, finishing this year at about 30% is a real accomplishment because that's been a target that we've all talked about for a long time. And using both recycling brokerage and the impacts of accretion that are adjustments for the rest of the space, we came in at exactly 30% for the full year and 28.9% for the quarter. Yes, Tyler. So if you look at the year-over-year comps, Q2 of 2021, in particular, is a really tough comparison because that quarter, we had 29.3% margin. So what you outlined just now is exactly what our projections are. We'll be down about 100 basis points in margin on a year-over-year basis in the first half of 2022 and up 100 basis points to 140 basis points in the back half of the year. And I think what's important is that the teams that are working on this are independent and not constrained by 1 another, right? So we're able to work on both things in parallel and move 2 really important parts of our business forward simultaneously. And they each have great returns and returns greater than we're even seeing on some of our core solid waste acquisitions, which makes us really confident in making these investments at the same time. Yes. I would tell you that we're certainly not taking our eye off the ball or the amount of focus that we have as an organization away from core solid waste acquisitions. And we're not seeing significant constraints with respect to DOJ pressure or anything like that outside of what we discussed when we were closing the ADS transaction. For us during the integration of ADS, that was the top priority organization, particularly in that part of the country. And for us, that was over half of the areas that we oversee. And so it was really important for us to make that priority #1 from an M&A perspective. The team is definitely looking at the landscape and participating in conversations. As you see some of the smaller players make decisions, we've always talked about the driving forces in their decisions. And this tight labor market has certainly been an accelerant for them. And so we're part of those conversations, still focused on that. We are going to remain disciplined in terms of return. And so buying at the right price is what will be important for us. The opportunity there really is on those long-term contracts that I mentioned earlier, and we continue to work very diligently in that space and have had some good success. And we looked for those long-term contracts to be an appropriate balance to market exposure, so that we do have an appropriate level of volatility without giving up too much of the upside potential. Some of them have been more than 10 years and less. And then, Michael, on -- from a planning perspective, our 2022 guide does not include any rollover benefit from M&A. The solid waste acquisitions were only about $40 million in 2021 and divestitures actually had a larger impact. So from an outlook perspective, the '22 guide doesn't contemplate anything from acquisition contribution. I'll start on the margin commentary. Pricing, I think, with respect to our pricing activities, what you saw was a much more significant and acute change in the cost environment in the third quarter across the U.S. economy, right? Whether or not our competitors saw those impacts, I observed their third quarter results as well. And so what I would tell you is that what we saw is that we were taking active steps with our employee base to be sure that we were curbing the impacts of turnover that were happening across the economy. From a margin perspective, I definitely don't think that you should take away from our 2020 results any indication of a plateau. Instead, what we know happened in 2021 is 2 things: one, we were integrating the ADS business, which has a 400 basis point lower margin base than the WM business. And so we knew that would have pressure on our margins coming into the year. And then secondarily, we saw that acute labor inflation cost hit us in the third quarter with a very prompt response really late in Q3, early in Q4 from a pricing perspective that you saw provide really good margin cover in the fourth quarter to the point earlier, that provided about 60 basis points, both from a price perspective and efficiency perspective benefit on a sequential basis going from Q3 to Q4. And we think some of that sequential improvement continues into Q1, where pricing activities will continue as we've mentioned before. Yes. So the easy answer here is that it's not a trade-off for us. So this is not taking the place of some other investment that we otherwise would have pursued way of growth or M&A. For us, this is incremental. And for that reason in terms of how you think about it in looking at our long-term growth outlook, this is incremental to that long-term growth outlook that we've outlined. Yes. Sean, that 50% target remains our goal, and we were happy to accomplish that in 2021. And you're right, from a guidance perspective, we're kind of right at the bottom end of that targeted range. When I look at the longer-term outlook, you're exactly right from a sustainability project perspective. With the outlook we gave for 2023 through 2025, you can expect that, that elevated level of growth investment will continue through that period. And that would be treated similarly to how we provided our guidance in 2022. When I look at the contributing factors, we think that there's more work that we can do on working capital optimization. EBITDA growth continues to be that long-term outlook of 5% to 7% that we've talked about. So we'll certainly continue to revisit that as we see different factors contribute to both the headwinds and tailwinds of the business as appropriate. So one, I can't really comment on because it remains a big question mark, and we can't predict it is the future of cash taxes and whether it be the corporate tax rate or look at bonus depreciation impacts. Those things could put some downward pressure, and that's just too hard for me to predict with regard to the things that we can control, we're going to continue working to not just hit that 50% benchmark but try and improve it from here. Yes, I'd tell you, when we look at margin, the one place in the business that we specifically see technology showing up other than what John has already mentioned particularly on the top line is on the SG&A side and our SG&A margin for 2022 are expected to be below the 10% that we accomplished in the current year. So we'll get you the information and Ed and Heather will be sure to circle back with you in terms of the percentage of our tonnage covered by the single stream network. Sorry, we don't have that at our fingertips. But with regard to the investments that we're making, it's more heavily weighted toward automation, but we will be exploring new markets and expanding our single stream footprint into markets that we don't currently serve."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Hey, good morning, everyone. Our team finished 2021 strong with fourth quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business of 6.5%. Our fourth quarter core price of 6.7% in the commercial line of business and 5.2% in our landfills clearly demonstrate continued discipline and pricing momentum. These strong fourth quarter pricing results were the leading contributors to robust collection and disposal core price of 4.8% for the full year. 2021 yield was also strong at 3.5% and reflects an improvement in rollbacks of almost 500 basis points as well as continued improvement in customer churn. As we move into 2022, our revenue management teams are focused on continuing to recover inflationary cost increases, improving residential profitability and remaining disciplined on disposal pricing. With the strong momentum we have entering 2022, coupled with our team's continued diligence, we expect to deliver core price of more than 5.5% and yield approaching 4%. Shifting to volumes. Fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.8%. For the full year, our collection and disposal volumes grew 3% and service increases outpaced service decreases nearly twofold. Organic growth trends in the first few weeks of 2022 have been encouraging even as some parts of the U.S. and Canada have seen spikes in Omicron cases during January. Commercial yards are tracking above 2021 levels. And while industrial hauls are modestly below last year, we see that as mostly due to weather disruptions in a few areas across the country. Overall, we expect 2022 collection and disposal volumes to grow about 2%, with commercial collection and MSW landfill volumes as leading contributors. Turning to operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased 150 basis points year-over-year to 63% with commodity-driven impacts from recycling brokerage rebates and fuel totaling 100 basis points. The remaining increase was related to higher labor costs as overtime increased due to the highest number of COVID-related absences we have seen as well as some risk management costs. During the fourth quarter, our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. And while the impacts of inflation and the tight labor market continue to put pressure on our metrics, there are positive trends in the fourth quarter results that position us well to deliver on our 2022 plan. Maintenance expenses improved sequentially as our continued efforts to standardize maintenance processes, particularly in our ADS locations, is reducing downtime and improving fleet availability. We also saw efficiency, net of incremental training hours, improving all lines of business. We expect these efficiency gains to continue and overtime hours to improve as our teams are taking intentional steps to improve retention, and we see that making an impact as annualized driver turnover has improved every month since August. We estimate that our focus on operating efficiencies and productivity helped to moderate the impact of inflationary cost pressure by about 60 basis points versus the third quarter. So putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve by the second half of 2022. Our collection and disposal business is well positioned to deliver great results in 2022 and so are our recycling and renewable energy businesses. As Jim discussed, our sustainability businesses are central to our growth strategy, and we're pleased with the strong results we're achieving in both the recycling and renewable energy businesses. In recycling, each quarter of 2021 earned a spot among our 5 most profitable quarters of all time, and we're anticipating an equally strong year in 2022. Our current outlook for 2022 is based on an average blended commodity price of $125 per ton, which is modestly above current values of $115 per ton. And similarly, renewable energy business delivered a very strong 2021 results and is expected to match this earnings contribution in 2022 as 2 additional renewable natural gas plants come online. We expect our fifth plant to be operational early in the second quarter and the sixth plant to be online by the end of the year. Our 2022 outlook is based on a RINs price of about $3, which is slightly above our 2021 rate but below current RINs pricing. And finally, our integration of Advanced Disposal continues to go smoothly as we marked the first anniversary of the acquisition at the end of October. To date, we have combined virtually all the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems. And with $36 million of synergies captured during the fourth quarter, we exited 2021 on track to exceed our expectations for full run rate cost and capital synergies of $150 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus on safely and reliably servicing our customers. The team has done an exceptional job managing our operations, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead.  I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2021 financial results and 2022 financial outlook in further detail. I think, Michael, the other thing we're watching is a small refinery exemption, right, because that's also been part of what's in that market. And there's been some commentary there. There's nothing decided yet, but to the extent that, that they extinguish some of the exemption there, I think that obviously bodes well. Yes, slightly over. I would add, Michael, too, that our most labor-intensive line of business, Jim talked to the automation benefits and the path we're pinning down with regard to residential. But you've seen the sequential improvement in residential core price and yield. You've also seen some of the volume degradation. We're going to continue to be selective there, especially in this kind of labor environment, which we don't see as short term. So we look at that price and labor trade-off as good for the shareholders. We're not done, Michael. I mean, I think when you think about this labor environment, right, from where we started to talk about the world changing a lot, well, the labor world has changed a good bit. We talked about that in our prepared remarks and a bunch of the question-and-answer period. So I would tell you that the goal line there has moved a little bit, right? The rate -- the labor intensity of that business is higher than the others. We still have automation opportunities there, and the margins there are still not competing with commercial and industrial. So as much as we've made terrific progress, we've seen some additional pressure, especially in the back half of the year on wages inflation, if you think about the impact of Omicron in Q4, I mean, all those things, I think we still have a good bit of opportunity there. Matt, it was -- yes, it was really spotty. I mean, it wasn't -- it was more of an impact on our overtime and our ability to service our customers. There were a few pockets. You referenced Canada, where it's been a little bit of a unique circumstance up there in eastern Canada. A little bit of volume impact there but generally speaking, no. More than half. I was just going to say, so I think if you heard what Devina commented on earlier about how we'll see that margin improvement kind of in the back half of the year. But if you assume that we'll see some margin pressure in the first half and you do the math to get to the second half of the year, I think it really gives you a certain level. It tells you about our level of confidence about what's going to happen with margin. I think on your CPI point, I mean, we think about 2.5% is what we're going to see for the full year next year. And as Jim mentioned earlier, some of that -- a good chunk of that comes is in the residential revenue line, and we see that the biggest lift for residential in July.  As far as turnover, I can't comment on the others. What I can tell you is we've had a very concerted effort and process that we've put in place. We are pleased with what we're seeing. It's obviously not a trend you fix overnight. But since August, we've seen improving acquisition and retention numbers. So when you look on a net basis, we are making headway in terms of those we're bringing on and those we're retaining. So Hamzah, I'll start with recycling. I mean, if you look at where recycling was 3, 4, 5 years ago, we charted a path to make that business compete from an investment and return standpoint with other lines of business. And even with the commodity tailwinds, even when you look at commodities were down, we were improving the returns on the margin on that business. And then if you look forward, I don't think we have a -- we have total confidence in our ability to execute on the recycling side. I think we've demonstrated that even when commodity prices were not the tailwind they were with the fee-for-service model, we've talked about. So I think we've got back steps on the recycling side. In terms of the team, we have in place to be able to build and operate these recycling plants. We're the biggest recycler in North America and we do -- I like to believe we do this better than everybody else. On the WM RE side, I think what Jim said is right now, we're assuming 100% of the risk. We've got optionality and Devina talked to some of the other backstops we could potentially put place down the road in terms of the commodity risk. In terms of the execution, Jim mentioned we have the fleet and we have a team that's been in the RNG business for a bunch of years right now. So to me, this is less about execution risk. It's really just about, given Tara and that team the resources they need to go faster. I would tell you, Walter, as you look at our momentum into Q3 and Q4, what we see in the outlook here, and we've talked about for 2022. And believe me, I asked that exact question of our revenue management team about once a week. And the short answer is no. I think the receptivity of just about all of our customers, they understand that inflation is real, that it's not going away. And we're trying to be thoughtful about it. One of the comments I didn't make to Hamzah's question was really trying to take our customer lifetime value view of our base and being -- obviously, we have, as Devina said, some acute inflationary headwinds that took everybody a tad off-guard. And while we're doing our best to recover that as quickly as we can, we're also -- this is also the long game, too. And I think that's when we're going through the model and customer lifetime value is certainly something we're factoring in there. And I think you're going to see that continued momentum throughout '22. I don't think from a -- I haven't seen -- other than what I commented on some of the selective revenue decisions we're making in residential, the receptivity of the customer base has been pretty consistent. It also depends, too, right, Devina, on the free cash flow. Obviously, the piece is 1 of the 2 numbers there. And if you look at our free cash flow, excluding those growth types of investments, then your ratio is right at 50%. If you look at the way we define it, which is pulling CapEx out and this is -- as we've talked a lot about today, those growth investments in RNG and recycling, we're essentially kind of making a capital allocation decision and spending extra CapEx. So the free cash flow guidance that we're giving is technically in that $2 billion-ish or a little bit more than that range. If you use that number to calculate the ratio, then it ends up being under 50%. If you use that the free cash flow number that we typically would report as a range of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion, then you're talking about something that's 50%. So there is a little bit of math in that, that needs to be understood. I think, Sean, I think, Jim, we all spoke to it. I mean, it's about making the labor pool that we have more efficient, right and using technology to replace some of these transactional jobs. And frankly, we're having a hard time filling. But that's where the operating side. If you look at it from a revenue side, we've talked a lot about the technology we've installed in our operations. And one of those is the technology we put on trucks. And if you look at service increases and decreases, some of the revenue growth we're seeing in commercial in particular, we think technology is part of the reason that's happening. We've automated a lot of those processes, where the folks behind the wheel don't have to worry about whether they have to take a picture, send the picture and that's all done with the technology and data and that analytics team we have. So it's not just the operating side, we are also seeing -- the investments we've made in what we call smart truck, as one example, sales coverage optimization, which is really about getting more efficiency out of our sales force, which I think is also contributing. Those are a couple of examples where the technology is actually helping directly on the top line.  In terms of the margin, juice."

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2021 was another very successful year at WM. Our strong operational and financial performance continued throughout 2021, delivering full year results that achieved or exceeded our financial guidance, which we increased from our original expectations twice during the year. We also successfully integrated the Advanced Disposal operations, generating synergies that have already exceeded our initial expectations with further synergies to come. During 2021, we focused on driving disciplined organic revenue growth, advancing technology investments focused on customer retention and growth and cultivating our people-first culture. Execution on these priorities came together to produce record growth in full year adjusted operating EBITDA and cash from operations. It can't be overstated how impressive it is that we generated more than $5 billion of operating EBITDA in a year like 2021. This robust operating EBITDA translated into all-time high cash from operations of over $4 billion, which allowed us to return a record $2.3 billion to our shareholders. Contributing to our operating EBITDA was our pricing where we finished 2021 on a very strong note as we made steady progress on covering the cost inflation in our business with excellent core price results across all lines of business. John will provide more details here, but we had record core price in both our landfill and residential businesses, 2 areas we've been particularly focused on over the last couple of years. Strong core price translated into the best collection and disposal yield that we've seen in more than a decade. Another great story about our pricing efforts is that we're still seeing strong volume growth and improvements in churn. 2021 churn of 8.4% is an all-time low. As 2022 kicks off, we're fully focused on recovering inflationary cost increases through our pricing programs and through the aggressive management of our cost structure. Our revenue management team is hard at work executing on the 2022 pricing plans so that we can recover the inflationary cost pressures in our business and deliver another successful year. In fact, we've recently seen several large customers who have historically been very price-sensitive, renew at significant increases. On the cost front, a big part of that management of our cost structure will be to materially improve our labor efficiency through the application of the technology investments we made over the last 18 months. Our expectation is to attrit between 5,000 and 7,000 positions over the next 4 years without replacements as these positions have become difficult to source and we expect that will continue to be the case. At the same time, we continue to focus on providing the best workplace for our employees and leveraging our asset network for growth. Regarding our 2022 financial outlook, Devina will provide more details. But at a high level, we expect to deliver total company revenue growth of approximately 6%, driving operating EBITDA growth of approximately 7% in 2022. It's fair to point out that both our revenue and our operating EBITDA guidance are at or above the high end of the ranges we targeted for the long term at our Investor Day in 2019. We expect margin expansion in the second half of the year with full year operating EBITDA margins expected to be flat to up 40 basis points compared to 2021. This sets us up for another year of robust cash generation. The extraordinary cash generation of our business positions us to plan a 13% increase in our 2022 dividend rate, while at the same time, making substantial increased investments in high-return renewable energy and recycling projects. Tara Hemmer was appointed as our Chief Sustainability Officer last summer, and she's charting a path to an aggressive long-term growth for our sustainability businesses. In light of our very strong cash generation, we plan to invest approximately $275 million in 2022 to expand our network of renewable natural gas plants with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $550 million. We expect to build 17 RNG plants over the next 4 years, which would grow our RNG generation by 6x. With conservative assumptions, these projects are expected to generate operating -- annual operating EBITDA run rate operating EBITDA of more than $400 million by 2026. And at today's higher prices, that operating EBITDA more than doubles. In the recycling business, we expect to invest $275 million in 2022 in MRF technology with incremental investments in 2023 through 2025 totaling approximately $525 million. These investments accelerate our automation of recycling process, processing to reduce costs, improve product quality as well as expand our single-stream recycling footprint. Together, these projects are expected to generate annual run rate incremental operating EBITDA of approximately $180 million by 2026, assuming $125 per ton blended commodity price. These growth projects further WM's sustainability leadership by increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network, expanding single-stream recycling capacity and automating recycling processing to reduce costs and improve product quality. They also are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions. In closing, we delivered a fantastic year in 2021, overcoming the challenges the year presented. As we look ahead to 2022, we remain committed to advancing technology investments that differentiate us, automating our processes to reduce our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Our success would not have been possible without the best employees in the business and I want to thank all 50,000 of our team members for their contributions.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss in more detail our operational results. Yes. And I think just to add to that on the strategic side, Noah, I think there really isn't -- I guess I'll say it this. We have 4 critical capabilities that nobody else has that enable us to really have confidence in these investments. Devina talked about how we mitigate risk. But as we think about them strategically, we have a team that's been doing this since 2015, and they know how to scale these plants across the whole portfolio. We have an asset that nobody else has, which is the amount of gas that we own. Nobody else can bring that to the table. We have the biggest CNG fleet in North America, and that enables us to fully close the loop and leverage the fleet to monetize the RNG. And then lastly, we've got the balance sheet. So if you look at all 4 of those, this made a ton of sense for us to accelerate investments in 2022 out through 2025. I don't think anybody expects that over the next 3 years that we're going to see significant downside in RINs pricing or, for that matter, natural gas pricing. But if there is, we built in pretty conservative estimates and still come up with these very strong returns that Devina referenced. I think you used the right word there, which is attrition. I mean, we're not talking about announcing a big layoff next week. We're talking about using high turnover. This whole Great Resignation as we've heard, we've been talking about that for a while now. And you've heard me talk about my daughter saying in her high school class, nobody wants to drive a truck or operate a piece of heavy equipment. So this is not something that just came to us in the last 3 months. We've been focused on it for a while. We built out those 3 single-stream plants, which we've discussed at length, and those have provided a significant labor benefit to us. So as we started thinking about it more, we saw other buckets of opportunity. When we look at moving, for example, from traditional rear load, we have call it, 3,000 rear load trucks available to shift to ASL. And those rear loaders probably driven more by safety than anything else so it's a safer vehicle at ASL, but there's a labor opportunity there in a category that's very difficult to fill, particularly in today's world. I mean, it's hard to get somebody to ride on the back of a truck and throw trash. So we've got some categories here where we feel like we can really use attrition to our benefit, become much more productive from a labor standpoint. And it's part of why I've maybe never been more optimistic than I am today, coming off of 2 pretty rough years, maybe as rough as any of us have seen in our lifetime and all of a sudden looking at a '22 where we can really start to leverage those investments we've made in technology in those buckets where we have transactional type jobs that are really hard to fill. I don't think this affects what we've tried to do with the culture. The culture is still absolutely being a great place to work. We've done a tremendous amount of benefits, offering to pay for college education for dependents, which I don't think any other company out there does. So we still feel very good about the fact that this is a great place to work. But where we have high turnover, let's take advantage of it. Might be giving me more credit here on a pretty technical question. I guess I would tell you that -- and I'm not going to give you a very technical answer because I just don't have the expertise. But -- and we can definitely get you an answer on that. But if we look at the -- the 1 thing that I mentioned was our fleet and having that fleet that's 70 -- over 70% of our routed fleet is now natural gas. That number came down a bit when we bought ADS, but we continue to buy 90% of the trucks each year as natural gas trucks. So it does give us a chance to sell those credits and fully close the loop but also paints a nice sustainability picture for us that Tara and the entire WM team are able to leverage. I'm not sure I can answer the more technical aspects of your question there, but hopefully, that gives you a little bit of insight. I think if you look at the year-over-year comps, the comps will certainly be easier purely from a price standpoint in Q1 and Q2. And then we started to kind of get our sea legs a little bit in Q3 and Q4. As we saw inflation, I would tell you that, that inflation that we started to see in Q3 did catch, I think, the entire world off-guard. But nobody expected coming into the year that we'd have 40-year high inflation. So Q3 was playing a bit of catch-up. Q4, we started to really catch up. But there is a lag in terms of how much pricing we can get to cover inflation. And honestly, we probably will be happy just to get to a point where we cover that cost. That's why the labor aspect is so important because we're attempting to raise margins here and add EBITDA dollars. And I'm not sure we do that purely through pricing. In fact, I would argue that pricing, we think, can be the primary offset to inflation. But in terms of adding EBIT dollars and adding margin points, we think the labor piece is a critical aspect of that.  To kind of talk about where it goes for the rest of the year, I mean, I would tell you that -- and I think John and I both talked about it in our prepared remarks, but the fact that we're seeing landfill pricing, and I gave an example of a couple of disposal customers that took pretty substantial price increases, who previously had been very, very price sensitive. And I think they -- that told us that they understood they're seeing inflation in their system. And so we needed to take significant price increases on those big landfill customers. John has talked about residential for a long time, and we're finally starting to see that residential is showing vast improvements on the price front. So I'm happy that we're seeing this across all lines of business. To me, that is maybe the best sign in terms of pricing is that we're seeing this not just in the commercial line of business but we're seeing it across all lines of business and all waste streams. Our special waste, if we look at our special waste and we look at just our baseline, we were up 7.9%, I think, was in our base business, pricing in special waste. And that doesn't really go into our yield number because it tends to be work, but that's a big increase. So we're happy with the progress we're making on price. I don't know that, that really spells out where we're going to be each quarter. Suffice it to say we're going to have easier comps in Q1 and Q2, though. Tyler, I know you asked a margin question, but I have to say, I guess time will tell whether investors are as optimistic as we are about this. But I got to tell you, I mean, 2021, I mean, I don't need to tell you what it looked like. But at no point in our lives that we've seen in 2021 where we're having hand-to-hand combat with a pandemic and, at the same time, seeing 40-year inflation. And with that, we still raised guidance twice and -- but for a couple of kind of one-timer type expenses, would have finished in the middle of -- almost in the middle of the range for that EBITDA guidance. I was actually stunned that we were able to work our way through 2021.  And then when we look at 2022, looking at our guidance, you remember the Investor Day in 2019 and that's why we referenced it. But putting guidance out there that's at the top end of that range, by the way, if you remember that presentation, we had 3% to 4% inflation in that 2019 presentation when we said that the range would be 5% to 7% for EBITDA, long-term range, and we're coming out with guidance at 7%. And that's off of a -- also the baseline that we raised twice in a kind of a crappy year in 2021. So that's why we're as optimistic as we are, and we'll see whether the market feels the same way. Yes, it might be a little bit more on labor. I don't know. We just had this meeting the other day where we talked about how much of this is going to be new plants versus rebuilds. Both of them have really high payback really or really low payback period, really high returns. So they're both great investments. And -- we're -- the good thing is we're not really constrained on -- in terms of cash. So we can probably -- it's less about either/or and more about and. We just want to make sure that we're as on those new markets, we're picking the right markets. I know Brent Bell and his team are looking closely at that. And then with respect to the labor savings, the number that we're giving is -- that we've talked about is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions over about a 4-year period. So if you kind of take the high end of that and you call it, I don't know, let's say, $75,000 all in, and keep in mind, some of these are -- a lot of these are temps, so we get charged a different number than they actually make. So let's say, $75,000 all in, that may or may not be the right number, but you can use that kind of to do the math. And that's probably where most of these [5 to 7] are. We're not talking about $200,000 jobs here. But the high turnover, the high attrition that we see in those jobs really, I think, is -- makes this the absolute right move to move away from those, particularly in a time where we have such a hard time filling those positions. I think we've given a lot of thoughts on this. I think the cadence that we've laid out internally is the right one. I think we mentioned 17 plants and that's a lot. So these things are complex. There is -- there are some questions, I guess, around supply chain and how much does that lengthen the amount of time that's necessary to build out these plants? But the acceleration, we think, is absolutely appropriate for all the reasons that we mentioned. Do we accelerate it further? I don't know that we do. I think we're -- I think we have the right amount of plants planned in the right places. We've looked at where the right places would be, what landfills will be feeding them, all of that. But I'm comfortable with the plan that we've laid out. But Devina, adding $400 million in EBITDA. I mean, and we've talked a lot about that, and that is at these for very conservative numbers. So $400 million EBITDA for the existing plants plus those 17 new plants is a lot. And that's why I mentioned in my remarks that, look, if you extrapolate it out at today's natural gas and RINs pricing, it's not $400 million, it's north of $800 million. So I think the amount of plants that we've planned is appropriate. At this point, the plan is 100% ownership of the 17. I think our -- the good news is that they have their finger on the pulse up there. It's just the pulse seems to be a little bit erratic, I guess. I would tell you that areas like CCRs, I mean, coal combustion residuals, which have been discussed within the EPA longer than some of the other items. That is an area that we really see the opportunity starting to develop. And we like -- the pipeline is kind of 40 million-ish tons over $1 billion for us in the next 4 years. And then things like PFAS. PFAS is -- we've always talked about that as an opportunity for ourselves. But there's a lot that is being discussed. I'm not sure we've seen the full consensus maybe is the best way to put it on a lot of those topics, with the exception maybe of ash and some of those have been talked about longer. I think the -- probably the best indicator would be in our churn numbers. I mean -- and I mentioned the churn was at an all-time low there. So I think the reaction is that people understand that inflation is real, that it's out there in the economy and that we're being judicious about how we apply it, but we're attempting to recover our costs. And look, that's been no easy task. We've seen a pretty heavy hit from labor inflation, particularly in Q3. That started to come back down the north a little bit in Q4, just simply because we've taken a lot of those adjustments already. But I think, John, the number was almost $100 million in adjustments for 2021. Yes. So I think the reaction has been reasonably accepting, Michael. I think it's some of both, right? John talks a lot about service increases versus decreases. There's -- I think it's almost like by a factor of 2 higher on service increases. So it's a bit of both, Michael. I mean, I mentioned probably the most forward-looking volume that we have, the revenue stream that we have would be in special waste. And I think what that portends for the economy is a good -- is that we don't see a big downturn in the economy coming even with the inflationary pressures. Our special waste pipeline looks really good. Our special waste in Q4 was really strong. And so the only areas that we saw that were weak were really driven by difficult year-over-year comps. I mean, roll-off volume was flat. But it was not because we're -- it wasn't something for us to be concerned about simply because 2020 had a lot of fire volume in Northern California and also a lot of -- you remember the late hurricanes that hit the Gulf Coast last year. And so there was a lot of volume from that. So without that, we would have seen a much more positive number in roll-offs. I think volume looks to be a bit of both of those, still kind of an emergence from COVID and which is kind of the service increase, service decrease piece, but also growth of the overall economy. I think we'll always focus on -- we'll always have our eye on M&A. And where there's opportunities, we'll try and take advantage of those. But at the same time, we don't want to overpay for these so we're careful there. But it doesn't look like the M&A landscape has changed that significantly. But we just felt like, as we looked at somewhat of a capital allocation decision here with respect to these big incremental investments in renewable natural gas and in recycling, that the returns on those were better than the returns for solid waste acquisitions. And while the cash generation of the business has been tremendous, it's not an infinite bucket. It's a finite bucket. And so therefore, we feel like we will invest more heavily there. But again, with M&A, to the extent that an opportunity arises and we feel like it builds a gap, we'll explore it. I mean, that's a great point, Devina, because when I -- I've talked about that 7% EBITDA growth number at the high end of that long-term range. But that is almost 100% organic. I mean, we're not talking about a big rollover from acquisitions. We had very little in the way of acquisitions, solid waste type acquisitions in 2021. So that 7% is in the face of still pretty significant inflation, but it's at the high end of that range, which is why we're talking about it. Well, we'll see. I mean, you might argue that the assumptions need to come down after the last 2 years. But yes, I mean, at Investor Day in 2019, we talked about what the world has been for the last 3 or 4 years, 4 or 5 years even, and which was pretty low inflation. So we built low inflation into those EBITDA and revenue ranges. We may decide after 2022 or 2023 that the world has changed sufficiently enough to have another Investor Day and to talk about different ranges. So Kyle, I think the challenges that we're looking at in 2022 are largely going to be inflation and maybe, to a lesser degree, this labor challenge that it feels like a long-term challenge and hence, the need to really become more productive from a labor standpoint and then the 5,000 to 7,000 positions that will attrit away from the business that we plan to replace the technology. By the way, what I didn't mention is we saw some add in 2021. We've talked a lot about these investments we've made in customer service digitalization. And so in 2021, as maybe somewhat of a test case, we fully automated our customer setup function. It was not a huge number of jobs. It was maybe 200 jobs, so about $7 million in savings. We did something similar with some of our -- we call it sales optimization. So we've gone through a piece of it and then, of course, some of what we saw with recycling. We've gone through a piece of it. But I would tell you that in general, we see and we hope to see 2022 be a much quieter year than the last 2. Hard to be no easier than the last 2, I guess. We did see -- we talked about the fact that we had as many -- I think the number we gave was 800 employees in Q3 at the peak who are out with either the virus or some exposure. And so therefore, they were quarantined, so 800 out of 50,000. Omicron, fortunately, it seems less serious but definitely more contagious. And so -- and that showed up in our numbers. The peak was 1,500, and probably John, half of those were drivers. More than half. So if there was any good news about it, it was that it happened in kind of December, January, which are slow volume months for us as opposed to the peak from Delta, which was in August, and early September, and those are our peak months for us in terms of volume. But right now, we're seeing those numbers come back down pretty dramatically. I think -- I mean, Hamzah, real quick, first of all, with respect to turnover, I don't know what the other guys' turnover is, I can't really compare. I would tell you if they're not seeing any inflation in their business, then they're operating in Antarctica because the whole world is seeing inflation. And regarding pricing, our core price is 5.2% for Q4. And you might say, well, you guys aren't very good at covering inflation because inflation was more like 6% for us and we were only showing 5.2% core price. We're not getting there. But as we talked about, there is a lag. Could we have been more aggressive? I don't know. I mean, boy, this thing came out of nowhere. I don't think anybody expected it. So I'm happy with the progress we're making. We've made a ton of progress sequentially between Q3 and Q4, and we'll continue to see that in 2022. I mean, there's been no shortage of potential suitors, Hamzah, on the RNG business for us. But at this point, we feel good about doing it on our own. But we have -- we still have optionality. If we wanted, sure. I mean, one of the assets that I talked about, 1 of the 4 things we bring to the table is the asset itself. And we have more landfill gas than anybody else. And so those 4 things I think are really what differentiates us in this foray into RNG that we think is going to be hugely valuable for us that we talked about 400 million at very conservative numbers, could be as high as 800 or more. So we like our position. But yes, that's the answer is that optionality means if we wanted to partner up with somebody, we could. I think also, Walter, worth mention here, I honestly can say I have no idea what the competition is doing other than what they publicly talk about on their calls. So it's not something we really pay attention to. We have a certain cost structure that we're trying to cover, and so that's how we focus our pricing. It's always a competitive business. So I mean, are there competitors out there that are taking customers? It's a very competitive business. We have cities where we have a dozen competitors or more. So I think the answer to that is, yes, that's just part of what we deal with day in and day out. But I don't I don't really focus on it because I feel like we are -- we have a really solid, robust plan in place with respect to all of these financial aspects and pricing is a big contributor. One last thing here. And I know we're a little bit of a long winded answer here. But to John's point, he talked about our data and analytics. So our team our data and analytics team is in the process of fully optimizing, they're working on a specific line of business. So fully optimizing roll up line of business and the number of permutations there, there's a massive amount of data, they built an engine there. And now they're in the process of kind of rolling this out over a period of months, but it will fully, fully optimize the ultimately all collection lines of business. Right now we're working on roll up but imagine all the data that goes into this is got road information, it's got driver data, it's got traffic, it's got customer data, containers, all kinds of stuff. The number of calculations is a ridiculous number. It's got like 17 zeros behind it. So it's a ridiculous number. But what it does for us is get to a point where we can fully, fully optimize these lines of business, and then you start talking about it the way maybe an Amazon talks about it and probably nobody else with respect to optimizing these routes.  We think there's a huge productivity take-up there. So what we haven't talked about are some of the driver turnover that we'd love to be able to take advantage of it. And this is one of those avenues. Some of the new market investments as we heard David there in our internal meeting was that it might be a city where we don't have a presence, but we do have a presence in a city that's 150 miles away. And we feel like the better of the two would be actually to go to the city to the South, and close down the facility in the city to the North. So there is a bit of a strategic decision there too. It's not always just where do we have underserved markets and how do we add capacity there. The 4% to 5% inflation is what we built in Michael. So -- and that's why we think that we do get to a point where we are able to cover that with pricing. And then a lot of the margin growth comes from places like automation and removing some of these transactional type positions. I think you nailed it there, Michael. It really is probably second half of '22. There's a lot of these, as we've discussed, a lot of these contract adjustments have a 12-month lookback. So it won't fully capture this pretty aggressive ramp-up in inflation until we get to July or even January of next year. You may recall we've talked about almost 70% of the adjustments that we take happen in the front half of the year. And so the ones that we just took in January, which I forget what the exact percentages are, but the big 2 months for adjustments are January and July. And what we just took in January, to the extent that there's a 12-month lookback, it's not going to include a whole lot. It's going to include maybe 3 months of the big inflation ramp. Next year, it will include 12 months. And so the farther we get into -- the deeper we get into the year with these adjustments, the more they will include this big ramp-up in inflation. All right. Well, thank you. Long call today, but I think, hopefully, you felt we gave some good details. Thank you all for joining us. We're very excited about finally coming into a year where it feels like we're going to have a bit quieter year. And so thank you all for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you out on the road."

Our third quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash-generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations. Our solid results put us on track to meet the higher full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we face some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints. Virtually, no segment of economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically accrued inflationary and supply chain challenges.  Disbursement inflation accelerated through the third quarter and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation at about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories. Overall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%. So that's the tough news. The good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBITDA raise, adjusted operating EBITDA, and free cash flow guidance ranges. And we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes. John, Devina, and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short-term and medium-term.  Not surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation. Our pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter. Standout performance continues to be the residential line of business with yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%. But keep in mind the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look back over the prior year. So, there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when cost step-up as quickly as they have. And it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs, until their next price increase cycle. A customer who has increased 4% in May, won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May.  That said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open-market businesses, evidenced by our low Let's level of rollbacks in more than a decade. We're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges. John will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately. Strategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs. We've said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as both a competitive advantage and a derisking mechanism in today's labor market where certain jobs simply don't attract the interest they previously did.  The most recent examples of that are the customer setup role which we just finished fully automating, and the 35-plus percent reduction in labor we've seen, where we've upgraded and rebuild our single-stream recycling plants. Given the success of these rebuilds and the labor inflation challenges of late, we have accelerated the retooling of the remaining singles-stream plans, and expect to address 90% of single-stream volume by the 2023-2024 timeframe. In the quarter, we saw some of the positive impacts of those new single-stream plans in our outstanding performance in our recycling business. Earnings contribution, and margins for recycling were at their highest level ever, driven by strong demand for recycle material and great operating performance from the new state-of-the-art [Indiscernible]. We were equally pleased with results in our renewable energy business in the quarter where robust growth continued, driven by more rents sales at higher prices.  With our long-standing expertise, continued growth and sustainability solutions and unrivaled asset network, WM is uniquely situated to support our current and prospective customers in their evolving sustainability needs. Our customers are increasingly seeking circular solutions for their materials, which is causing growing demand for recycled content. Of note, our focus on unlocking more plastic from the waste stream, drove a 25% increase in plastics we recycled since 2019. Recycling and renewable energy are 2 of our key growth areas, highlighted in our annual sustainability report published earlier this month.  The report outlines the progress WM has made against our sustainability goals, and details investments we've made to advance our sustainability journey. In particular, this year's report focuses on the people behind the progress WM has made in the past year, and how they are doing their parts to take care of our customers, neighbors, and the environment and communities across North America. The bottom line for the quarter is this, we generated higher-than-expected volume and revenue growth in the third quarter, which positions us well for 2022. At the same time, we faced an unexpectedly acute and fast-moving challenge from the inflation, supply chain, and labor shortage headwinds.  And we managed our way through it well and still expect to achieve results within our 2021 guidance ranges. And this challenge presents an opportunity for us to move more decisively in those strategic areas of automation, sustainability, and workforce planning to further separate ourselves in this industry. In conclusion, I'd like to thank the nearly 50,000 people [Indiscernible]. They continue to deliver driving another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA, and free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim. And good morning. Our team continues to execute very well despite a challenging operating environment producing more than 7% percent organic revenue growth in collection and disposal business in the third quarter. This growth combined with continued integration of Advanced Disposal drove operating EBITDA more than 14% higher. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing pressure on labor and other cost categories, and we are addressing these impacts to our pricing programs to controllable cost management, efficiency improvements, and workforce planning.  Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to a 180 basis points to 62.2% in the third quarter, as we experienced pressure from inflationary costs, supply chain constraints, and stronger-than-expected volume growth. In particular, costs-related to the hiring and training of new employees impacted labor costs in the third quarter. We also saw overtime hours increase as the team adjusted to meet the higher-than-expected collection volumes. We anticipated a good portion of this labor pressure that are showing up on our cost, as we made proactive market wage adjustments earlier in the year to get in front of labor shortages and meet growing demand. At the same time, we are working to automate a number of roles where we see longer-term challenges to attract and retain employees.  In the residential line of business, we continue to work through the last 40% of our route, including those from ADS that are not fully automated, while continuing to be very selective in the business we are willing to take on, as evidenced by our yield and volume results in the third quarter end of the last few years. While we are now incurring the cost associated with these investments, we're only in the early stages of seeing the benefits. Our labor market supply chain constraints that they accelerated in Q3, coupled with robust volume growth in the Third Quarter, have also added pressure in [Indiscernible] operations, repair and maintenance costs are increasing as we hire additional technicians and incur some overtime hours to address the strong volume growth, we continue to see in the collection lines of business.  Similarly, we've had to temporarily place some of our higher-cost trucks back in service to address the volume demands. In addition, our third-party sub-contractors, our transfer stations, are facing similar pressures and are passing those increased costs onto us. Overall, efficiency in the collection business in the third quarter, adjusting improved in the collection business in the third quarter adjusting for increased training hours. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and we are committed to recovering our cost increases through pricing and again, taking the most expensive truck off the road and reducing most expensive hour of the day. Now I want to focus on several of the positives in the quarter.  Turning to our strong revenue results, third-quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 3.8%, which outpaced our expectations. We continue to see strong volume driven by economic reopening with commercial volume up 4.6% and special waste volume up by 16.6%. And we see runway for continued solid performance in the fourth quarter. Customer metrics were also strong in the quarter. Service increase is outpaced, service decreases by more than twofold for the second consecutive quarter and churn was 8.7%. Year-to-date net new business for small and medium business customers is up more than 10%. Finally, our integration of advanced disposal continues to go smoothly.  We've combined around 70% of the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems and we remain on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. We have achieved nearly 26 million in annual run rate synergies during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $60 million combined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the Fourth Quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year. And we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of costs and capital savings. Our teams are working tirelessly to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities, and I want to thank them all for their efforts. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices, and an increased collection in disposal core price continued to deliver top-line growth ahead of expectations in the Third Quarter. As a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year. Total Company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5% with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%. Its guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values. We're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance, between $5 billion and $5.1 billion. Which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint, and almost seven -- almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year.  Third-quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40-basis point improvement over 2020. Included in our results is about $16 million of increased digital investments, as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term. We remain focused on managing our controllable spending making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business. Third Quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%. Cash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs.  While there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter, due in large part to the timing of cash from P&G credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020. Overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we're putting in place to enhance our systems and processes. In the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first 9 months of the year to 1.13 billion dollars. Our 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project or taking longer than planned.  As we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong. Investments in recycling technology and equipment at our [Indiscernible] are expected to be about $200 million for the year. While we continue to target full-year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels with some of our spending pushed into 2022 primarily due to supply chain constraints. We generated $773 million of free cash flow in the Third Quarter. And through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, putting us well on our way to our full-year targeted free cash flow of $2.5-2.6 billion. We've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first nine months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing one billion dollars of our stock. We continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71 times, as the strength of our business performance in the successful integration of the acquired ADS business, drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan. As we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice, and capturing growing volumes. We know our strategies set this up for a solid finish to 2021. With that Erica, we'd be happy to address the teams\u2019 questions.\nOperator: As a reminder, to ask a question you will need to [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.\nTyler Brown : Good morning, guys.\nJim Fish : Good morning, Tyler.\nTyler Brown : Hey Jim. Thanks for all the color on inflation. I know you guys don't give a ton looking ahead on these Q3 calls, but it just sounds like the setup for pricing looks very favorable next year. I mean, you've got clearly this inflationary environment. You have strong CPI resets and you alluded to an open market that let's just say feels very rational. So just big picture. Why wouldn't pricing in '22 accelerate pretty meaningfully? And do you have confidence that you can price in excess of unit cost inflation next year?\nJim Fish : Yes, I think you're right about that, Tyler. I think that's probably the single biggest message of the day, which is this, yes, we saw some cost inflation, which has been talked about at any business show you watch on TV talks about it, and add a little bit of -- it was a quicker than we thought. It was more acute than we thought. And the price that is our biggest lever, as I said in my remarks. To offset that, is not perfectly timed with that. So, there is a lag there. We've talked a lot about the fact that 40% of our business is tied to an index. And I mentioned that there is a, in many cases, a look back on that. About title rep, 40% of our business in that 40%, about 40% of that comes in January.  So, the price adjustment comes in January, about 30% comes in July, so 70% of the price increases on that index business come in the first half of 2022. And then the remaining 30% some of it comes in October and then there's a spattering that comes in the remainder of the year. And then on the open market piece, I gave the example of the customer that -- the job the 4% price increase back in May. And we still have a customer to keep in mind here. We don't want to go back to those customers and, hey, inflation hit us hard than we thought, so we're going to go ahead and increase you buy another 6 here in October. We're going to be smart about it and wait until we get to their annual cycle, in May of next year, and then we'll increase them by the amount that we need to cover costs and improved margins.\nTyler Brown : Yes. Okay. That is extremely helpful. Real quickly, Devina. So, it sounds like there's a lot going on in the EBITDA margins this quarter year-to-year. I don't know if you can distill it down, but can you just help us bridge out that 140 basis points down in EBITDA margin, specifically, and some of the key buckets there?\nDevina Rankin : The two primary buckets to look at are really the inflation impacts that we've discussed and then recycling brokerage. So, we would say that about 60% of the impact was from inflation and about 40% was from recycling brokerage. To put a little more color around the inflationary impacts that Jim mentioned earlier, that total was a $160 million during the quarter, we estimate that our normal inflationary impacts would have been about 60 of that. So that was a $100 million in excess of what we consider normal inflationary impact.  And then, you might recall that we had projected that we were going to have about 60 million over and above our normal run rate in the back half of the year. So, we think that our costs in Q3 were about $60-$70 million above what we would have projected, and that you can see is a pretty meaningful impact to the overall margin of the business. I think it's important to look at our cost structure and see that 35% of our operating costs are labor-driven. And then when you consider subcontractor costs, which is effectively indirect labor, that's another 15%. 50% of our cost structure is labor-driven and we've seen that as a big driver.\nJohn Morris : And Tyler, I would only add that, with the additional volume I commented on in my prepared remarks, part of what we've done is we're spending a little bit more overtime in the short term to be able to go out of service and take advantage of the strong volumes. I mentioned in my comments that outpaced our expectations, which we view as a good thing over the long term. And certainly, we have a clear line of sight to what those costs are as Devina spoke to.\nTyler Brown : Great. I'll hop back in the queue. Thanks.\nDevina Rankin : Thanks, Tyler.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari : Good morning. Thank you. Just a follow-up on just operating leverage. I guess listening to your comments, is it fair to say that second half next year is when you'll see greater op leverage? Just given timing of these pricing resets and related to the op leverage, how much of your cost increase is incremental hiring because of labor availability issues impacting that, versus how much is just restarting your existing labor cost base up that you referenced with wage adjustments? I would also put subcontractor cost into that existing labor reset, I guess.\nJohn Morris : Yes, Hamzah, good morning. I would tell you that when I look at the labor increase hold hours and this is in aggregate. About a quarter of it is related to some additional training and hiring we're doing, some of that has to do with turnover pressures that I think we're seeing, and just about everybody in a transportation industry is seeing. I think the good news is, over the last four or five months, we've actually started to make good progress in terms of our retention rates on whatnot. And I think the labor resets we talked to last quarter, which are clearly showing up in this quarter as well, are having an impact there.  The other three quarters of it, if you will, were up numbers is related to some of the OT we're incurring. Part of that, as I mentioned, is we don't view that over the long term as a bad thing because we're seeing volume increase as we are outpacing our expectations. I think as Jim mentioned previously to Tyler's question, we have a clear line of sight on what we need to do through pricing and efficiency gains, etc., and automation to be able to overcome that. I do think 70% of that index, business resetting in the first half of the year is clearly something that we're focused on, and as Jim mentioned, our pricing strategy more broadly is not going to change, our expectations will have to change to keep pace with the cost increases we've outlined.\nHamzah Mazari : Got it. Very helpful. My follow-up question I will turn it over is, just around investment in automation, as well as technology, could you -- and I know Jim, you referenced the automation peace being accelerated and you mentioned the Murphs and you mentioned automation of some customers start up functions. Maybe at a high level, what inning are you in terms of automation, what, is there left to do? And is it just on recycling? And then also as part of that, just from a technology perspective, again, what's behind you? What's yet to come? Thank you.\nJim Fish : I think comps that we're probably in the second inning, I like using the baseball analogy since we're in Houston today, but I think we're probably in the second inning here. There's a lot that falls under that automation umbrella. It's not just -- we've talked a lot about customer service digitalization, which is really is kind of the digital side of that. But the automation that I refer to is -- while it's technology, it's not technology as we think about it. It's not your mobile device. It's optical sorters at our plants. And we have 45, I think, single-stream plants. And we've fully automated 4 of those plants at this point.  So, if you think about the fact that we're taking 35 - ish percent of labor out, and to put that into dollars for you, it's about a million dollars per plant per month in labor savings. And think about the fact that we still have 40 of those plants -- 40 - ish of those plants left. Now, some of those plants, we're obviously automating the big ones first, so you won't get a million dollars from the very smallest plant, but that's a piece of the automation. But to your question, it's not just those recycled positions I mean, we have a lot of positions that have very high turnover that feel like they lend themselves to automation and we'll be looking at those going forward.  So, what's the total number that would be impacted by [Indiscernible]? But I think it's certainly more than just customer setup, which we fully automated and recycling. And then also, I want to make one last point to your question to John on OpEx, which we haven't talked about, but if you think about the COVID effect, we had almost 900 employees out at the peak. And the peak week I think, was the third of September. And we pay those employees, we made a conscious decision to pay them. If you think about the impact of that 900, by the way, a lot of those, probably over half of those were drivers. so, we are paying them and at same time, we are picking up their routes with overtime hours.  The cost of that was somewhere between 2 and 3 million bucks over a two-week period. So, it's not insignificant. And that number of both, that 900 by the way is quarantined employees and COVID employees. Employees who have the virus. That number has come back down as we've seen it across the U.S. to a much more manageable number it's in the -- I looked at the essay it's in the 200 range now down from the P. So that was a short-term cost that we were bearing. That was certainly coming back and we won't see that repeat unless we have another variant that kicks off and causes us to be back in the same position.\nHamzah Mazari : Still, I just want to clarify one thing, the savings from the recycling plant is a million dollars per plant for quarter, not for both?\nJohn Morris : Sorry. Sorry. I knew it.\nHamzah Mazari : Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So, press assistance for Devina, looking at merging enhancement in and you've had a great track record in historic years of achieving margin, margin improvement year-to-year, but now, as you re-priced and a lot of your re-pricing is to pass through costs, you are able to protect EBITDA dollars, but it can be somewhat margin dilutive given the pass-through nature. So, when we look to next year, is there any cautionary you're cautioning us to keep that in mind when we look at historic margin expansion versus next year margin expansion, given that a lot of your revenue is cost pass-through revenue though.\nDevina Rankin : Yes. I would say that, what's really important is to go back to one of Jim's earlier comments about the fact that, the acute nature of the cost increase that we experienced during the third quarter. And the fact that our index revenue is more significantly weighted towards the first half of the year, indicates that we had a mismatch in terms of when a lot of those price increases are pushed through. And when we experienced the more acute cost increases, we are not in any way indicating that this is anything other than that lag and kind of a one time or short term, I should say, impact in terms of margin.  Degradation, our outlook remains strong in terms of the businesses ability to work, both through pricing and operating efficiencies as the automation that we've discussed in order to improve the long-term margin of the business. I think that 2022 can have some noise in it with regard to some of these timing differences continuing, particularly as you think about the year-on-year impact of the volume expansion that we've seen in 2021. But our outlook remains solid with respect to expectations over the long term being one of margin expansion even with a higher cost structure.\nWalter Spracklin : Okay. That's great color. Appreciate that. And then my follow-up is just with regard to wages and the percentage of your workforce that has been re-priced if you want to call it that, is there a larger part or a meaningful part of your workforce that you perhaps are coming up on wage discussions or renewal that will likely see an outsized price increase that has not yet been built into your numbers, or are you pretty much done it from that overall wage repricing type of framework?\nJohn Morris : So, Walter, most of the wage adjustments we spoke to in Q2 and have carried through in Q3 have really been in drivers, technicians, front-line employees, our recycling folks, etc. So, I'm taking the swag here, but it's probably 2/3 to 70% of our folks have -- are in that population in some way, shape, or form. And Greg, that's not to mention -- say that we've raised rates on every one of those employees, but we've addressed that employee group. And then the balance listen, I think everybody's in a competitive labor market right now. We're keeping a close eye on the other 30% to 35% were part of that initial push. But that's something we do on regular basis and we go through that at least annually to make sure that we're compensating all's folks adequately relative to what's going on in the market.\nWalter Spracklin : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. I appreciate the time as always.\nDevina Rankin : Thank you, Walter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifle.\nMichael Hoffman : Good morning. 2018 solved a lot of the inflation for the first time, the market's first-time seeing garbage deal with inflation. How would you compare the pace of that versus the pace of what you're experiencing right now? And then let's remind everybody, you covered all of that inflation with pricing, eventually then too.\nJim Fish : I don't think they're that close. I think this is this is far more acute than what we've seen. I'm not sure there's anybody working at our Company today. Maybe a couple of people in their '70s that have seen this type of rapid inflation. At the example I gave of the customer that got the 4% price increase in May was a real example. So, we weren't even seeing this in May, this came on as quickly as almost the end of July but -- and really has accelerated. You weren't hearing people talking about it.  I mean, it's being talked about all the way up at the White House, being talked about by the Fed s Chair so I would tell you that this is more acute than we've seen before, but the other thing -- and you're right Michael, we did cover it with price and we think price is the primary labor to cover this and we're doing a good job with it. But it's why I wanted to make sure we stressed that there are some high turnover jobs that really don't have to do with this inflationary period.  There are some high turnover jobs that we need to really serious look at automating, and at the same time using customer service digitalization to really extract maximum efficiency out of our organization. John and I have talked a lot about it, and we think when we fully automate these routes, there's somewhere between 10% and 15% efficiency improvement, because you're not going to automate a truck driver job, certainly in my career, maybe even in my lifetime. But we do think we've got significant opportunity there on the driver side for efficiency growth.\nMichael Hoffman : Okay. Fair enough. So clear message is, and you've said this in pieces, but I want to say it out loud, you've expected to cover all this inflation. You just need time and time isn't years, it's months.\nJim Fish : I think that's right. I mean, the 40% -- I think we should focus on the 40%. That is indexed driven and then I talked about, how half of that or 70% of it happened in the first half of the year. There is a look-back, so the adjustment that comes in January for some of those big contracts, some of those have a 12-month look-back which won't capture the full effects of inflation. We wouldn't get the full effect of this last three months of inflation on those adjustments. We wouldn't get the full effect of that until the adjustment we take in January of 2023. The adjustments that we take in July will pretty much reflect all of the inflationary -- this acute inflationary impact.\nMichael Hoffman : Okay, fair enough. Devina, on the free cash flow, what are your assumptions to maintain the guidance of 2.5 to 2.6 on cash flow from ops and capital spending?\nDevina Rankin : From a capital spending perspective, we would love to spend every bit of the full-year guidance that we put forth the $1.78 to $1.88 billion. But as I mentioned, all year we've seen things move just a little more slowly than we would've liked, and we have taken some proactive steps in order to pull some capital forward. That being said, right now, we think we could finish the year somewhere in the range of $1.7 to $1.8 billion. We'd love for it to be a higher number than that, particularly as we've made investments in renewable energy and recycling specifically. In terms of the other puts and takes, I think is important to recall that we expected an increase in our cash taxes on a year-over-year basis.  We've seen that through the 9 months, but you'll have another leg of that in Q4. And then we've seen significant working capital contributions in the first 9 months of the year. We think we'll give some of that back in Q4, just based on some of the timing impacts of some payments that we have. But all-in-all really good performance in cash flow for the year, I would say it is the one that has certainly exceeded the expectation in every single aspect of contribution. All in all, total free cash flow at about the midpoint of 255 is tremendous growth. On a year-over-year basis and meaningfully ahead of the 1965 that we normalized, when you look at 2020 for the impact of the proceeds from divestitures from the ADS transactions. So that shows the level of growth on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow.\nMichael Hoffman : Okay. But to sum your comments, if you end up spending on the lower end of Capex, there's an upward bias to the midpoint of the range on free cash flow.\nDevina Rankin : The one thing I would caution there is on the cash flow from ops we do have the taxes and working capital impacts that I mentioned. That's the only caveat that I would have there, but yes.\nMichael Hoffman : Okay. And then John, I saw Tim Hawkins and Jason Kraft and a couple others from other companies recently, they were all in a NWEA meeting and they all suggested that peak open positions -- you had past peak open positions and you were at least no longer struggling against peak open. Is that an accurate statement still? So, this pressure has peaked and started to add a little bit?\nJohn Morris : I would tell you within WM, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, probably last 4 or 5 months, Michael, we've really started to show some progress in terms of being able to net add, if you will, month-in and month-out at some of those key positions, specifically, the driver ranks. There's still a lot of competition out there, there's still a lot of pressure, as Jim mentioned, you can't turn on the TV without hearing about some form of pressure and transportation, whether it's marine, whether it's rail or whether it's truck transportation. But as I mentioned, the good news is I think the efforts we made to make some of those wage adjustments coupled with our efforts around retention and hiring are certainly yielding positive results here for the last 4 or 5 months.\nMichael Hoffman : So, you're off the peak open positions is the clear message?\nJohn Morris : Correct.\nJim Fish : Michael, think about it, we have 10% - ish of our drivers that are making over 100,000 a year. And I don't know what the figure is for 90,000 above, but it's significantly higher than that. So, at the same time, we have really good benefits, we've announced the education benefits several months back. We chose to pay them during COVID, we've chosen to pay them -- still paying them when they're out on quarantine. We really have focused on taking care of our teammates here and we think that pays dividends for us in terms of reducing the amount of churn.  To John 's point, I think the number I read last week was, there are 82 thousand open trucking positions across the U.S. And then of course the same time we're seeing this volume increase. And so, we're trying to compensate for that as well. It's a good thing, it's a good problem to have, but yes, to John's point, we're getting past that peak but we think we're well-positioned. We like our [Indiscernible] these roles as part of why we're -- we have really good pay benefits and we hope to make sure that we differentiate ourselves there.\nMichael Hoffman : And then last one for me, for John, I think I picked up in your remarks, [Indiscernible] are seeing net new business growth not just where you opened leverage. Its net new business growth and there's momentum, that momentum should continue. So that's good news, but I guess there's two pieces to that. How does that impact the thoughts about capital spending inflation be able to meet that net new business growth.\nJohn Morris : Well, first I would tell you 2 things I mentioned on our prepared remarks, Michael, which are pretty familiar to you, which is the net service increases versus decreases is strong from Q2 to Q3. And then I mentioned also small and medium business, which is a traditional collection business and that I would say temporal off and the big really large accounts. We're seeing good momentum there. That was the 10% number, but I don't see in terms of capital, I mean, the capital spends there would be some incremental capital, containers and to some extent, when you guys -- we've talked about before that step function between filling up a raft and the next raft, but we don't see that as out of the ordinary capital spend.\nMichael Hoffman : Terrific. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC.\nKevin Chiang : Good morning, everybody, thanks for taking my question here. If I can ask us on your repricing strategy for next year, just given how acute inflation as you've mentioned, Jim. Just wondering how you look to maybe limit or you've got lag between when you see pricing versus maybe this year that inflation might be more persistent than we all had hoped a few months ago. But like, are you looking at contract terms that might allow you to reprice in the event that inflation continues to persist at elevated level? Or are you pricing for maybe what do you think inflation could go versus maybe, what costs you've seen increase in the back half of this. Just being interested in seeing how you think about that repricing strategy to kind of limit that lag, as you look out into 2022.\nJim Fish : Yeah, Kevin, the lag really just hits us in the first part where we're this kind of three-month period, once we catch up with that, and once we catch up with these adjustments on the 40% that's index-based then, unless inflation runs up from here, which we don't anticipate, I'm not sure I've seen anybody that anticipates that, then we feel like we're in a really good position with pricing to cover these cost increases plus add the margin. Now if inflation goes to 15% then I will retract that statement, but I don't think anybody expects that, so right now, if you look at core price, for example, we're pretty happy with the core price numbers that we were showing. Core price was 6.1% for the quarter in commercial. That's a big core price number if you look at the landfill line of business which has gotten a lot of questions over the last couple of years.  Core price in landfill was 4.6% as 2 consecutive quarters over 4% of core price. And really that's probably the best metric for looking at price increases, is core price versus yield. Yield was very good as well, but the core price probably is the best approximator of price increases. So, I feel really comfortable with the existing CPI and core inflation in the system that the pricing mechanisms that we have in place will cover that and also provide us some opportunity to improve margins as we go into 2022. keep in mind that 12-month look back, a big piece of the adjustment that's coming in January won't include all of the inflation that's going to take a year to capture that.\nKevin Chiang : That's great color. Yes, let's all hope we're not heading for 15% inflation there. Maybe I can ask a non-inflation question. Recently put out this P-fast strategic roadmap, I guess as it looks to evaluate what the studies and I guess things they look to go over the next few years. Just wondering, as you look at the roadmap that you put out there, is there anything that you would comment on? Does it align with what you thought that EPA would do? Or think the EPA should do as they evaluate the P - fast strategy?\nJim Fish : Yeah. Kevin that was just something off the press here in the last week or two with some milestone dates that the EPA published on some things they want to get covered, but I think that our answer is still the same to that. It could present a little bit of short-term cost impact to us, but we still believe over the long term, the post-collection assets we have are going to benefit from that certainly over the long term.\nKevin Chiang : All right. I'll leave it there, thank you for taking my questions.\nJim Fish : Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman : Hi, Jim. Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just curious if you've seen any instances where this labor shortage is causing a down take in service quality. Have you guys track that anything concerning there? I just wonder if that ultimately impacts WM's ability to continue this great pricing trend we've been seeing?\nJohn Morris : So, Sean, there's pockets of it. I mean, first and foremost, we track it, we track it everywhere every day. And all of us get to keep a close eye on that. We have seen some pockets of pressure for sure where we've had some acute turnover issues. But as we mentioned in Michael -- to the response to Michael's question, we feel like we're past the peak and we're making headway there.  To your second question, is it profound enough for us to have to concede anything on the pricing front? No, we don't think so. And I think if you look at where a lot of the -- probably with the most acute labor issue was, for us is really around if you look at our residential, and you look at our pricing -- what our pricing strategy has been and what our corporates and yield results were for the quarter and over the last number of quarters, it has not impacted us there or frankly, in any other line of business.\nJim Fish : Well, I think it's on the churns. The churn is probably the best metric for us to gauge that. And churn came in at 8.7% for the quarter. We look at the same quarter prior year was 8.8%. We're not seeing an uptake in churn, I think we're doing everything we can at the operating level, there's a lot of pressure on the operation, when you have 500 - ish drivers out due to COVID during the peak or when we've got all of these hiring pressures, you expect that there's going to be some pockets, as John mentioned.  And we're doing everything we can to make sure all the way up to my level. I get notes from customers saying, hey, my recycling was missed today, and so I pour that out to the right person to make sure that we pick them. But there have been some pressures, but we think that we're moving in the right direction and it certainly helps when you see that number of 900 employees out for COVID come down to 200. That was a pressure that was hard to compensate for.\nSean Eastman : Okay. That's helpful. And what about safety? I mean, do we need to be kind of incrementally concerned about safety and the costs associated with safety issues around this labor dynamic. What's the thought there, Jim?\nJim Fish : Well, I should probably let John answer that but the answer would be we never compromise on safety. Safety is at the very top of our list. And so, we are extremely focused on being a safe organization. John, anything to add there?\nJohn Morris : Well, I would tell you that's where --that's one spot where technology and to some extent automations are helping. We're in the process of updating all the on-board equipment for our collection vehicles, our supervisory vehicles, with regard to being able to scan what's going on with behavioral issues, so we've got some artificial intelligence has been -- is about 70% through our entire collection fleet. They will help with things like following distance, cell phone usage, that kind of thing.  So no, I think if you look at our safety results, we've seen a little bit of pressure as we have integrated ADS, but the core WM business continues to perform well, and we're well on our way to getting ADS. The ADS business, totally tucked-in there as well. It's part of why we saw a doubling of our training hours because as we're hiring more folks, we absolutely make sure that they get fully trained. And so, we saw that 2x in our training hours, we think that number comes down as we're hiring fewer and fewer drivers and technicians.\nSean Eastman : Okay. Very interesting stuff. Thanks for the help guys.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye : Thanks for taking the question, and frankly, I know I can do as a reminder not to use my cellphone when I'm off the road, so appreciate that guys. I guess the linkage between potential Capex shortfall in operations is something I'd be interested to learn a bit about. Obviously, the commercial vehicle industry's experiencing production constraints, and that's impacting customer delivery. Just wondering how is this impacting the cost structure? I think you mentioned having utilized some older vehicles, but maybe you can talk through a little bit how that might be translate into elevated [Indiscernible] this year.\nDevina Rankin : Sure, now. I think the way that we think about that, John mentioned, having to take some of the older vehicles off of the sidelines, so to speak, and pull those into service. We saw that most significantly in the industrial line of business and roll-off, because that's where we were able to flex most significantly in 2020. While we do see it on the operating expense side, our long-term focus continues to be on optimizing our fleet strategies so that we focus on reducing the total cost of ownership of each vehicle. We have seen some pressure in terms of per unit cost on the fleet overall. Some of that general inflationary cost pressures, but some of that is that we're driving towards automation to the points they've made earlier particularly in the residential line of business.  So, while we have a more expensive unit on the street, we definitely see the benefits of that in terms of lower operating expense both from labor and efficiency. So overall in the current quarter, that's a component of the cost pressure that we saw. But I would say that that was certainly secondary to the wage pressures that we experienced overall and we expect that to abate as we get truck deliveries. It's an interesting point that through nine months, we'd only gotten 70% of the trucks that we expected to get in 2021 to date. So, we think that when we get those trucks delivered, you'll start to see some of those impacts reduced as well.\nNoah Kaye : That's helpful. I guess, on the flip side of that, there is what I presume are industry-wide labor and others shortages to do construction work at landfills for expansion. Presumably that's going to be a source of upward pricing pressure at the landfill. You had 3.5% yield this quarter, but I assume you got a pretty robust pricing outlook at the landfill. And this may be a contributing factor.\nJohn Morris : Yes, I think Jim did a good job of categorizing some of that too. I think there's a few places, steel costs, container costs, or [Indiscernible] landfill liner, those are all things that our supply chain team and the respective operating teams are keeping a close eye on. And we may make a decision to a fixed can versus buy-one while steels up 200% or whatever the number is. But that's not the bulk of it. I think Devina spoke to the majority of which is really a fleet spend some of the delays there coupled against strong volume. So that's why you talked about some of this cost pressure being somewhat acute not having confidence whether it's on a collection or the post-collection side, including the transfer of subcontractor side that we're going to be able to recover that.\nJim Fish : One thing really quick, Noah, that I would caution against is matching the price increase that we got on third-party volume at the landfill against what might be our cost increase there. That doesn't -- by the way just because we got 3.6% yield, I think was the number. So, 3.5% yield on MSW, that does not imply that that's what our cost increase was at the landfills. Keep in mind a lot of the volume that comes in a landfill is our own volume which gets priced at the curve, which gets priced at the street. So, our overall, we've talked a lot about our overall cost increase. That includes cost increases that we're seeing at the landfills and I wouldn't necessarily assume that just because we got 3.5% on MSW, that that means that's landfill prices are costs are only going up by 3.5%.\nNoah Kaye : Appreciate that. Thanks, Jim and John. Devina, maybe just one quick one. Any one-time or pull-forward of spending programs that you're currently doing this year that could turn into a margin tailwind next year as you lap, I know that customer service digitalization has been investment focused, but anything you would call out that sort of a margin tailwind next year, that's controllable?\nDevina Rankin : The only one that we've mentioned over the course this year that's higher and therefore creating some margin compression in 2021, is our incentive compensation. That being said, I think everyone at WM would love to see us knock it out of the park next year such that that's not a giveback in 2022, but it's the one that I would call out. There's not anything else other than inflationary lag that we've already discussed.\nNoah Kaye : Perfect thanks so much.\nJim Fish : Quit texting and driving Noah.\nNoah Kaye : You got it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey : Thank you. Good morning. Tagging onto that last question, I believe in the past you've said about 15% of your labor unrelated benefits component of the cost stack is over time. And you noted it was elevated this quarter. Can you give us an idea of how elevated it was relative to that long run average. And then, should we expect that to normalize into next year as COVID settles out and hopefully you get in front of some of these labor issues.\nJohn Morris : No David, I think overtime was up about 6% for the quarter. and yes, I do think that as we get some of these folks on board, that we've talked about it from our staffing efforts, you're going to start to see, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, take the most expensive outlaw off the street and right now, because of some of the staffing challenges, but also because we've got volume in the collection lines of business particularly commercial and industrial that really outpaced our expectations. We view that as a good problem to have long-term and the short-term, obviously we're spending a little bit some premium dollars to get that volume collected.\nDevina Rankin : So, one quick clarification because it's a great point, David, and this 6% increase is actually on a sequential basis when you look at that on a year-over-year basis, it is meaningfully more pronounced. Their year-over-year is about 30% increase in overtime hours that you saw in our costs in the current year.\nDavid Manthey : Right. It was down significantly last year, so I guess it would've been up anyway, right?\nDevina Rankin : That's right.\nDavid Manthey : [inaudible 00:57:00] up year over year.\nDevina Rankin : It is up year over year cost and ba -- we were already seeing some of that in the second quarter so the sequential impact is meaningfully lower.\nDavid Manthey : Okay. Thank you. And just a dumb mechanical question here. Can you help me understand the mechanism by which higher recycled commodity prices drive your operating expenses higher?\nDevina Rankin : Sure. In our operating expense table and as you will see what we call a cost of goods sold line. And that cost of goods sold line is where our rebates to our customers show up for the higher commodity prices. We also provide a table in the press release that shows the impact of that on margin and the current quarter that was 140 basis points. So, a very significant impact to the year-over-year comparison\nDavid Manthey : Makes sense. Thanks very much for that.\nJim Fish : Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silver with BMO Capital Market.\nJeff Silver : Thanks so much. I know it's late, I will just ask one. Just continuing the conversation about inflationary increases. I'm just wondering from an M&A perspective, are your sellers\u2019 expectations also increasing it, are they're either expecting higher multiple? Or are they talking about adjustments to adjusted EBITDA because it'll be higher cost? Thanks.\nJim Fish : I guess anecdotally, what I would say is we have heard that sellers are facing the same [Indiscernible] in the work placing which is -- and we've kind of called it the great resignation and so a lot of them are saying, I've had enough and I'm going to ahead and sell. But I will tell you this in terms of their expectations, I can't control their expectations, what I can control is what I pay. And I would much rather grow organically than pay a multiple of 13 or 14 times. We're going to continue to be disciplined about that.\nJeff Silver : Okay. That's great to hear. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJeff Silver : Yes, hi. Good morning. Jim, in your prepared remarks, you mentioned some of the ten percentage points of price increase are needed to cover the higher costs, can you talk about open market price increases that you folks are putting through in October and into year-end? Are you seeing that 10% improvement at the yield line for your open market business based on price increases you're putting through now on what's up\nJerry Revich : for renewal?\nJohn Morris : Now that 7% to 10% is more of a core price number. I mean, that's the price increase that we're taking. So, in order to get down to yield, you have rollbacks and then there's a mix component in the yield calculation. So, you're not going to see 7% to 10% yield. But we do feel like with -- I mentioned that we've seen 8.7% labor inflation for the quarter. So, in order to cover 8.7% labor inflation and Devina and John talked a lot about the non-labor inflation that we're seeing. We do feel like we've got to take 7% to 10% price increase. So that's what that number is.\nDevina Rankin : Okay. And I believe it was two quarters ago, maybe you mentioned that you're satisfied with the way the industry has priced rationally so far in this recovery, has that continued, and now that we're seeing this acute period of inflation?\nJim Fish : Did I say that? I usually don't comment on the industry because I can't control the industry. But I am satisfied with how it worked, and we do a nice job of looking at not only what our inflation is, and this has been much more accelerated than we anticipated. But also, how do we -- how do we improve margins? And then -- and I think when you look at just about any metric, the one that we've -- we've held out as being a real success story is residential. with residential yield of 5%, it wasn't that long ago that we were talking about residential yield in kind of the 1% range, we feel good about our own lines of business in terms of our own pricing. And that's really the only place that I speak of is what WM is doing.\nJerry Revich : Okay. And then in terms of -- on the labor costs topic, obviously labor availability is going to be low for the duration of this economic cycle. So, what gives you comfort that we've reached that point of peak inflation from a training cost standpoint, etc., if labor availability could actually be an escalating issue if we're having this conversation a year from now.\nJohn Morris : Well, I think Jerry, we've obviously got in front of the wage adjustments. We started that a couple of quarters ago, really in Q2, and I think that's certainly helped the other benefits we have in place have certainly helped. And I think we're tracking the job openings obviously versus volume. And the good news is the volume is still strong. That does put some pressure on the folks that we need to recruit. But as I mentioned, for the last 4 or 5 months, we're making headway in terms of what we have versus what we need, even relative to that volume.\nJim Fish : And I don't think we can overstate it, I've talked about it a number of times, but a lot of conversation of pricing today has been the primary lever. But I don't think we can overstate the importance of using automation to take some of the labor intensity out of this business. It's a very labor-intensive business. We have positions that have very high turnover that does not imply that we're going to come out with a big reduction, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying we can automate some of these roles and then use the attrition to our benefit.\nJerry Revich : I appreciate the discussions. Thanks.\nJim Fish : Take care.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger : Hey guys, thanks for squeezing me in. I'll keep it short. Just for free cash flow conversion, Devina, when we think about next year, can you just walk through the puts and takes, obviously, CapEx this year is coming a low-end for obvious reasons. There might be some catch-up next year so maybe CapEx of sales higher-than-normal. But maybe you could walk through, we think about next year 2022 the working capital taxes, anything you'd like to highlight, as we're thinking about 2022.\nDevina Rankin : Yeah. That's great question, Michael, and we're certainly already looking at how then to do it, a 2022 outlook. The strong conversion in 2021, we step back from that and say if we're targeting a conversion of every EBITDA dollar check free cash flow at 50%, we think that that's the outcome that's representative of a long-term trend for our business. We've had success reducing our interest in tax cost, tax as you mentioned, could be a question mark for the year ahead.  Too early for us to say one way or the other although we are optimistic based on some of the conversations that are happening currently. The progress that we've made on working capital management has been really strong. That's one where I would tell you it's too early for us to declare victory. We're implementing new systems and processes and those are showing some value. But it's certainly difficult to use that at least above that 50% target. In terms of managing Capex, that really is the one that we're focused on. Because for us, a capital dollar really should be looked at no differently than an M&A dollar.  And if we can get a better return on invested capital from accelerating capital in our recycling business or renewable energy facilities, we're going to do that, and so while we're going to look for opportunities to accelerate capital, we're going to do so in the same prudent way that we always do from a capital allocation perspective. And look at long-term maintenance capital versus what we will consider more of a growth-oriented or investment-oriented capital decision. So that's the one place that there could be an evolution in our discussion in 2022, but no specific outlook that we can provide at this point, we'll give you more color next quarter.\nMichael Feniger : That makes sense. And since you mentioned 2022, when I look at the midpoint of your 2021 guide, implies a margin of 28.3%, around there. That's kind of the fourth straight year of being in that margin range. Now, granted one of those years was in a pandemic, so that's impressive and now we're contending with inflation. So, I know this has been asked a couple of different ways, but do we think that the margin, the typical margin expansion we see in this business, 50 bps or so. Is that more of like a 2023 story, as we're kind of in the odd period of coming out of COVID and deal with some of these inflationary pressures?\nDevina Rankin : What's really interesting in that same three-year period that you mentioned is the impact of recycling on our margin. And I think if you stripped out a way and really consider the inflationary cost impact and the COVID impacts that we've already discussed. You are seeing strong execution on the front line of delivering that 50 basis points of margin expansion. That's why we really wanted to add the color on commodity price impact in the press release, so hopefully you can take a look at that table.  But I do think that, when we look at the collection efficiency at all of these training impacts, we've been really satisfied with the continued front-line execution of the team in delivering margin expansion though it is covered up. So, we have positive expectations for 2022 at this point though there is going to be some continued noise from the recycling part of the business.\nMichael Feniger : Great. Thank you.\nJim Fish : Thanks Michael.\nDevina Rankin : Thank you.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Mr. Jim Fish, President and CEO.\nJim Fish : Well, just to conclude, thank you to -- again, big shout out to all of our 50,000 folks for the great quarter. This has been a challenging year and a-half challenging two years for everyone, but particularly for them who have been providing essential service on the frontline since day one. So, thank you to them. Thank you to all you for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you through the quarter and early in next year. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed. Thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter performance highlighted the exceptional cash-generation capability of our business model as we generated nearly $1.2 billion of cash from operations. Our solid results put us on track to meet the higher full-year financial outlook we provided last quarter, even as we face some of the highest inflation that we've seen in years, along with the labor and supply chain constraints. Virtually, no segment of economy, including government and the private sector, has been unaffected by these historically accrued inflationary and supply chain challenges.  Disbursement inflation accelerated through the third quarter and during the quarter, we saw roughly $60 million of labor inflation at about $100 million of inflation in other operating cost categories. Overall, our underlying labor inflation for the third quarter was 8.7%. So that's the tough news. The good news is that the business continues to perform well as demonstrated by the fact that we still expect to finish the year within our previously adjusted operating EBITDA raise, adjusted operating EBITDA, and free cash flow guidance ranges. And we will be above our prior revenue range due to strong price execution and strengthening volumes. John, Devina, and I will discuss what we're doing about these labor and inflationary pressures in the short-term and medium-term.  Not surprisingly, our disciplined price programs are the primary lever to combat cost inflation. Our pricing programs delivered core price of 4.6% and collection and disposal yield of 3.5% in the third quarter. Standout performance continues to be the residential line of business with yield of 5%, while MSW yield improved to 3.5%. But keep in mind the price escalations on about 40% of our revenue are tied to an index, often based on a look back over the prior year. So, there's a timing lag in adjusting index pricing when cost step-up as quickly as they have. And it's important to understand that a portion of the remaining 60% of our business won't get the full 7% to 10% price increases we believe we need to cover rising costs, until their next price increase cycle. A customer who has increased 4% in May, won't get the full cost recovery price increase until next May.  That said, we're seeing a favorable price environment across our open-market businesses, evidenced by our low Let's level of rollbacks in more than a decade. We're very focused on directly addressing the labor challenges. John will discuss the quarterly impact and how we're working to address this immediately. Strategically, we're looking at this acute challenge as an opportunity to expedite the automation of certain jobs. We've said previously that we view the automation of certain high turnover positions as both a competitive advantage and a derisking mechanism in today's labor market where certain jobs simply don't attract the interest they previously did.  The most recent examples of that are the customer setup role which we just finished fully automating, and the 35-plus percent reduction in labor we've seen, where we've upgraded and rebuild our single-stream recycling plants. Given the success of these rebuilds and the labor inflation challenges of late, we have accelerated the retooling of the remaining singles-stream plans, and expect to address 90% of single-stream volume by the 2023-2024 timeframe. In the quarter, we saw some of the positive impacts of those new single-stream plans in our outstanding performance in our recycling business. Earnings contribution, and margins for recycling were at their highest level ever, driven by strong demand for recycle material and great operating performance from the new state-of-the-art [Indiscernible]. We were equally pleased with results in our renewable energy business in the quarter where robust growth continued, driven by more rents sales at higher prices.  With our long-standing expertise, continued growth and sustainability solutions and unrivaled asset network, WM is uniquely situated to support our current and prospective customers in their evolving sustainability needs. Our customers are increasingly seeking circular solutions for their materials, which is causing growing demand for recycled content. Of note, our focus on unlocking more plastic from the waste stream, drove a 25% increase in plastics we recycled since 2019. Recycling and renewable energy are 2 of our key growth areas, highlighted in our annual sustainability report published earlier this month.  The report outlines the progress WM has made against our sustainability goals, and details investments we've made to advance our sustainability journey. In particular, this year's report focuses on the people behind the progress WM has made in the past year, and how they are doing their parts to take care of our customers, neighbors, and the environment and communities across North America. The bottom line for the quarter is this, we generated higher-than-expected volume and revenue growth in the third quarter, which positions us well for 2022. At the same time, we faced an unexpectedly acute and fast-moving challenge from the inflation, supply chain, and labor shortage headwinds.  And we managed our way through it well and still expect to achieve results within our 2021 guidance ranges. And this challenge presents an opportunity for us to move more decisively in those strategic areas of automation, sustainability, and workforce planning to further separate ourselves in this industry. In conclusion, I'd like to thank the nearly 50,000 people [Indiscernible]. They continue to deliver driving another quarter of double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA, and free cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Good morning, Tyler. Yes, I think you're right about that, Tyler. I think that's probably the single biggest message of the day, which is this, yes, we saw some cost inflation, which has been talked about at any business show you watch on TV talks about it, and add a little bit of -- it was a quicker than we thought. It was more acute than we thought. And the price that is our biggest lever, as I said in my remarks. To offset that, is not perfectly timed with that. So, there is a lag there. We've talked a lot about the fact that 40% of our business is tied to an index. And I mentioned that there is a, in many cases, a look back on that. About title rep, 40% of our business in that 40%, about 40% of that comes in January.  So, the price adjustment comes in January, about 30% comes in July, so 70% of the price increases on that index business come in the first half of 2022. And then the remaining 30% some of it comes in October and then there's a spattering that comes in the remainder of the year. And then on the open market piece, I gave the example of the customer that -- the job the 4% price increase back in May. And we still have a customer to keep in mind here. We don't want to go back to those customers and, hey, inflation hit us hard than we thought, so we're going to go ahead and increase you buy another 6 here in October. We're going to be smart about it and wait until we get to their annual cycle, in May of next year, and then we'll increase them by the amount that we need to cover costs and improved margins. I think comps that we're probably in the second inning, I like using the baseball analogy since we're in Houston today, but I think we're probably in the second inning here. There's a lot that falls under that automation umbrella. It's not just -- we've talked a lot about customer service digitalization, which is really is kind of the digital side of that. But the automation that I refer to is -- while it's technology, it's not technology as we think about it. It's not your mobile device. It's optical sorters at our plants. And we have 45, I think, single-stream plants. And we've fully automated 4 of those plants at this point.  So, if you think about the fact that we're taking 35 - ish percent of labor out, and to put that into dollars for you, it's about a million dollars per plant per month in labor savings. And think about the fact that we still have 40 of those plants -- 40 - ish of those plants left. Now, some of those plants, we're obviously automating the big ones first, so you won't get a million dollars from the very smallest plant, but that's a piece of the automation. But to your question, it's not just those recycled positions I mean, we have a lot of positions that have very high turnover that feel like they lend themselves to automation and we'll be looking at those going forward.  So, what's the total number that would be impacted by [Indiscernible]? But I think it's certainly more than just customer setup, which we fully automated and recycling. And then also, I want to make one last point to your question to John on OpEx, which we haven't talked about, but if you think about the COVID effect, we had almost 900 employees out at the peak. And the peak week I think, was the third of September. And we pay those employees, we made a conscious decision to pay them. If you think about the impact of that 900, by the way, a lot of those, probably over half of those were drivers. so, we are paying them and at same time, we are picking up their routes with overtime hours.  The cost of that was somewhere between 2 and 3 million bucks over a two-week period. So, it's not insignificant. And that number of both, that 900 by the way is quarantined employees and COVID employees. Employees who have the virus. That number has come back down as we've seen it across the U.S. to a much more manageable number it's in the -- I looked at the essay it's in the 200 range now down from the P. So that was a short-term cost that we were bearing. That was certainly coming back and we won't see that repeat unless we have another variant that kicks off and causes us to be back in the same position. I don't think they're that close. I think this is this is far more acute than what we've seen. I'm not sure there's anybody working at our Company today. Maybe a couple of people in their '70s that have seen this type of rapid inflation. At the example I gave of the customer that got the 4% price increase in May was a real example. So, we weren't even seeing this in May, this came on as quickly as almost the end of July but -- and really has accelerated. You weren't hearing people talking about it.  I mean, it's being talked about all the way up at the White House, being talked about by the Fed s Chair so I would tell you that this is more acute than we've seen before, but the other thing -- and you're right Michael, we did cover it with price and we think price is the primary labor to cover this and we're doing a good job with it. But it's why I wanted to make sure we stressed that there are some high turnover jobs that really don't have to do with this inflationary period.  There are some high turnover jobs that we need to really serious look at automating, and at the same time using customer service digitalization to really extract maximum efficiency out of our organization. John and I have talked a lot about it, and we think when we fully automate these routes, there's somewhere between 10% and 15% efficiency improvement, because you're not going to automate a truck driver job, certainly in my career, maybe even in my lifetime. But we do think we've got significant opportunity there on the driver side for efficiency growth. I think that's right. I mean, the 40% -- I think we should focus on the 40%. That is indexed driven and then I talked about, how half of that or 70% of it happened in the first half of the year. There is a look-back, so the adjustment that comes in January for some of those big contracts, some of those have a 12-month look-back which won't capture the full effects of inflation. We wouldn't get the full effect of this last three months of inflation on those adjustments. We wouldn't get the full effect of that until the adjustment we take in January of 2023. The adjustments that we take in July will pretty much reflect all of the inflationary -- this acute inflationary impact. Michael, think about it, we have 10% - ish of our drivers that are making over 100,000 a year. And I don't know what the figure is for 90,000 above, but it's significantly higher than that. So, at the same time, we have really good benefits, we've announced the education benefits several months back. We chose to pay them during COVID, we've chosen to pay them -- still paying them when they're out on quarantine. We really have focused on taking care of our teammates here and we think that pays dividends for us in terms of reducing the amount of churn.  To John 's point, I think the number I read last week was, there are 82 thousand open trucking positions across the U.S. And then of course the same time we're seeing this volume increase. And so, we're trying to compensate for that as well. It's a good thing, it's a good problem to have, but yes, to John's point, we're getting past that peak but we think we're well-positioned. We like our [Indiscernible] these roles as part of why we're -- we have really good pay benefits and we hope to make sure that we differentiate ourselves there. Yeah, Kevin, the lag really just hits us in the first part where we're this kind of three-month period, once we catch up with that, and once we catch up with these adjustments on the 40% that's index-based then, unless inflation runs up from here, which we don't anticipate, I'm not sure I've seen anybody that anticipates that, then we feel like we're in a really good position with pricing to cover these cost increases plus add the margin. Now if inflation goes to 15% then I will retract that statement, but I don't think anybody expects that, so right now, if you look at core price, for example, we're pretty happy with the core price numbers that we were showing. Core price was 6.1% for the quarter in commercial. That's a big core price number if you look at the landfill line of business which has gotten a lot of questions over the last couple of years.  Core price in landfill was 4.6% as 2 consecutive quarters over 4% of core price. And really that's probably the best metric for looking at price increases, is core price versus yield. Yield was very good as well, but the core price probably is the best approximator of price increases. So, I feel really comfortable with the existing CPI and core inflation in the system that the pricing mechanisms that we have in place will cover that and also provide us some opportunity to improve margins as we go into 2022. keep in mind that 12-month look back, a big piece of the adjustment that's coming in January won't include all of the inflation that's going to take a year to capture that. Yeah. Kevin that was just something off the press here in the last week or two with some milestone dates that the EPA published on some things they want to get covered, but I think that our answer is still the same to that. It could present a little bit of short-term cost impact to us, but we still believe over the long term, the post-collection assets we have are going to benefit from that certainly over the long term. Thank you. Well, I think it's on the churns. The churn is probably the best metric for us to gauge that. And churn came in at 8.7% for the quarter. We look at the same quarter prior year was 8.8%. We're not seeing an uptake in churn, I think we're doing everything we can at the operating level, there's a lot of pressure on the operation, when you have 500 - ish drivers out due to COVID during the peak or when we've got all of these hiring pressures, you expect that there's going to be some pockets, as John mentioned.  And we're doing everything we can to make sure all the way up to my level. I get notes from customers saying, hey, my recycling was missed today, and so I pour that out to the right person to make sure that we pick them. But there have been some pressures, but we think that we're moving in the right direction and it certainly helps when you see that number of 900 employees out for COVID come down to 200. That was a pressure that was hard to compensate for. Well, I should probably let John answer that but the answer would be we never compromise on safety. Safety is at the very top of our list. And so, we are extremely focused on being a safe organization. John, anything to add there? One thing really quick, Noah, that I would caution against is matching the price increase that we got on third-party volume at the landfill against what might be our cost increase there. That doesn't -- by the way just because we got 3.6% yield, I think was the number. So, 3.5% yield on MSW, that does not imply that that's what our cost increase was at the landfills. Keep in mind a lot of the volume that comes in a landfill is our own volume which gets priced at the curve, which gets priced at the street. So, our overall, we've talked a lot about our overall cost increase. That includes cost increases that we're seeing at the landfills and I wouldn't necessarily assume that just because we got 3.5% on MSW, that that means that's landfill prices are costs are only going up by 3.5%. Quit texting and driving Noah. Okay. Thank you. I guess anecdotally, what I would say is we have heard that sellers are facing the same [Indiscernible] in the work placing which is -- and we've kind of called it the great resignation and so a lot of them are saying, I've had enough and I'm going to ahead and sell. But I will tell you this in terms of their expectations, I can't control their expectations, what I can control is what I pay. And I would much rather grow organically than pay a multiple of 13 or 14 times. We're going to continue to be disciplined about that. Did I say that? I usually don't comment on the industry because I can't control the industry. But I am satisfied with how it worked, and we do a nice job of looking at not only what our inflation is, and this has been much more accelerated than we anticipated. But also, how do we -- how do we improve margins? And then -- and I think when you look at just about any metric, the one that we've -- we've held out as being a real success story is residential. with residential yield of 5%, it wasn't that long ago that we were talking about residential yield in kind of the 1% range, we feel good about our own lines of business in terms of our own pricing. And that's really the only place that I speak of is what WM is doing. And I don't think we can overstate it, I've talked about it a number of times, but a lot of conversation of pricing today has been the primary lever. But I don't think we can overstate the importance of using automation to take some of the labor intensity out of this business. It's a very labor-intensive business. We have positions that have very high turnover that does not imply that we're going to come out with a big reduction, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying we can automate some of these roles and then use the attrition to our benefit. Take care. Thanks Michael. Well, just to conclude, thank you to -- again, big shout out to all of our 50,000 folks for the great quarter. This has been a challenging year and a-half challenging two years for everyone, but particularly for them who have been providing essential service on the frontline since day one. So, thank you to them. Thank you to all you for joining us this morning. We look forward to talking to you through the quarter and early in next year. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we have seen all year, robust volume growth, strong recycling commodity prices, and an increased collection in disposal core price continued to deliver top-line growth ahead of expectations in the Third Quarter. As a result, we are once again updating our revenue outlook for the year. Total Company revenue growth is now expected to be between 17% and 17.5% with yield and volume in our collection and disposal business of about 6.5%. Its guidance also includes an expectation for continued strength in recycled commodity prices and RIN values. We're confirming our most recent 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA guidance, between $5 billion and $5.1 billion. Which is an increase from the prior year of about 17% at the midpoint, and almost seven -- almost 5% higher than our initial outlook for the year.  Third-quarter SG&A was 9.7% of revenue, a 40-basis point improvement over 2020. Included in our results is about $16 million of increased digital investments, as we advanced technology that will benefit customer engagement and lower our cost to serve over the long term. We remain focused on managing our controllable spending making sure that we allocate each dollar to initiatives that will enhance our business. Third Quarter net cash provided by operating activities was $1.18 billion, an increase of 15%. Cash from operations growth continues to be driven by our robust increase in operating EBITDA, including the contributions from the ADS acquisition and lower interest costs.  While there was a modest unfavorable working capital comparison in the third quarter, due in large part to the timing of cash from P&G credit and our deferral of payroll taxes in 2020. Overall, improvements in working capital demonstrate the benefit of tools we're putting in place to enhance our systems and processes. In the third quarter, capital spending was $464 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first 9 months of the year to 1.13 billion dollars. Our 2021 pace of capital spending has continued to be slower than we planned due to supply chain constraints and construction project or taking longer than planned.  As we discussed last quarter, we are proactively pulling forward capital investment, particularly in recycling, where we know the returns will be strong. Investments in recycling technology and equipment at our [Indiscernible] are expected to be about $200 million for the year. While we continue to target full-year capital spending at the low end of our $1.78 to $1.88 billion guidance range, we could see 2021 coming in below targeted levels with some of our spending pushed into 2022 primarily due to supply chain constraints. We generated $773 million of free cash flow in the Third Quarter. And through September, our business generated free cash flow of $2.29 billion, putting us well on our way to our full-year targeted free cash flow of $2.5-2.6 billion. We've returned more than $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first nine months, paying $730 million in dividends and repurchasing one billion dollars of our stock. We continue to expect to repurchase up to our full authorization of $1.35 billion in 2021. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.71 times, as the strength of our business performance in the successful integration of the acquired ADS business, drove the achievement of our targeted leverage ratio ahead of plan. As we enter the final stretch of 2021, our teams are focused on accelerating our disciplined pricing programs, managing our controllable costs, positioning WM as an employer of choice, and capturing growing volumes. We know our strategies set this up for a solid finish to 2021. With that Erica, we'd be happy to address the teams' questions. The two primary buckets to look at are really the inflation impacts that we've discussed and then recycling brokerage. So, we would say that about 60% of the impact was from inflation and about 40% was from recycling brokerage. To put a little more color around the inflationary impacts that Jim mentioned earlier, that total was a $160 million during the quarter, we estimate that our normal inflationary impacts would have been about 60 of that. So that was a $100 million in excess of what we consider normal inflationary impact.  And then, you might recall that we had projected that we were going to have about 60 million over and above our normal run rate in the back half of the year. So, we think that our costs in Q3 were about $60-$70 million above what we would have projected, and that you can see is a pretty meaningful impact to the overall margin of the business. I think it's important to look at our cost structure and see that 35% of our operating costs are labor-driven. And then when you consider subcontractor costs, which is effectively indirect labor, that's another 15%. 50% of our cost structure is labor-driven and we've seen that as a big driver. Thanks, Tyler. Yes. I would say that, what's really important is to go back to one of Jim's earlier comments about the fact that, the acute nature of the cost increase that we experienced during the third quarter. And the fact that our index revenue is more significantly weighted towards the first half of the year, indicates that we had a mismatch in terms of when a lot of those price increases are pushed through. And when we experienced the more acute cost increases, we are not in any way indicating that this is anything other than that lag and kind of a one time or short term, I should say, impact in terms of margin.  Degradation, our outlook remains strong in terms of the businesses ability to work, both through pricing and operating efficiencies as the automation that we've discussed in order to improve the long-term margin of the business. I think that 2022 can have some noise in it with regard to some of these timing differences continuing, particularly as you think about the year-on-year impact of the volume expansion that we've seen in 2021. But our outlook remains solid with respect to expectations over the long term being one of margin expansion even with a higher cost structure. Thank you, Walter. From a capital spending perspective, we would love to spend every bit of the full-year guidance that we put forth the $1.78 to $1.88 billion. But as I mentioned, all year we've seen things move just a little more slowly than we would've liked, and we have taken some proactive steps in order to pull some capital forward. That being said, right now, we think we could finish the year somewhere in the range of $1.7 to $1.8 billion. We'd love for it to be a higher number than that, particularly as we've made investments in renewable energy and recycling specifically. In terms of the other puts and takes, I think is important to recall that we expected an increase in our cash taxes on a year-over-year basis.  We've seen that through the 9 months, but you'll have another leg of that in Q4. And then we've seen significant working capital contributions in the first 9 months of the year. We think we'll give some of that back in Q4, just based on some of the timing impacts of some payments that we have. But all-in-all really good performance in cash flow for the year, I would say it is the one that has certainly exceeded the expectation in every single aspect of contribution. All in all, total free cash flow at about the midpoint of 255 is tremendous growth. On a year-over-year basis and meaningfully ahead of the 1965 that we normalized, when you look at 2020 for the impact of the proceeds from divestitures from the ADS transactions. So that shows the level of growth on a year-over-year basis and free cash flow. The one thing I would caution there is on the cash flow from ops we do have the taxes and working capital impacts that I mentioned. That's the only caveat that I would have there, but yes. Sure, now. I think the way that we think about that, John mentioned, having to take some of the older vehicles off of the sidelines, so to speak, and pull those into service. We saw that most significantly in the industrial line of business and roll-off, because that's where we were able to flex most significantly in 2020. While we do see it on the operating expense side, our long-term focus continues to be on optimizing our fleet strategies so that we focus on reducing the total cost of ownership of each vehicle. We have seen some pressure in terms of per unit cost on the fleet overall. Some of that general inflationary cost pressures, but some of that is that we're driving towards automation to the points they've made earlier particularly in the residential line of business.  So, while we have a more expensive unit on the street, we definitely see the benefits of that in terms of lower operating expense both from labor and efficiency. So overall in the current quarter, that's a component of the cost pressure that we saw. But I would say that that was certainly secondary to the wage pressures that we experienced overall and we expect that to abate as we get truck deliveries. It's an interesting point that through nine months, we'd only gotten 70% of the trucks that we expected to get in 2021 to date. So, we think that when we get those trucks delivered, you'll start to see some of those impacts reduced as well. The only one that we've mentioned over the course this year that's higher and therefore creating some margin compression in 2021, is our incentive compensation. That being said, I think everyone at WM would love to see us knock it out of the park next year such that that's not a giveback in 2022, but it's the one that I would call out. There's not anything else other than inflationary lag that we've already discussed. So, one quick clarification because it's a great point, David, and this 6% increase is actually on a sequential basis when you look at that on a year-over-year basis, it is meaningfully more pronounced. Their year-over-year is about 30% increase in overtime hours that you saw in our costs in the current year. That's right. It is up year over year cost and ba -- we were already seeing some of that in the second quarter so the sequential impact is meaningfully lower. Sure. In our operating expense table and as you will see what we call a cost of goods sold line. And that cost of goods sold line is where our rebates to our customers show up for the higher commodity prices. We also provide a table in the press release that shows the impact of that on margin and the current quarter that was 140 basis points. So, a very significant impact to the year-over-year comparison Okay. And I believe it was two quarters ago, maybe you mentioned that you're satisfied with the way the industry has priced rationally so far in this recovery, has that continued, and now that we're seeing this acute period of inflation? Yeah. That's great question, Michael, and we're certainly already looking at how then to do it, a 2022 outlook. The strong conversion in 2021, we step back from that and say if we're targeting a conversion of every EBITDA dollar check free cash flow at 50%, we think that that's the outcome that's representative of a long-term trend for our business. We've had success reducing our interest in tax cost, tax as you mentioned, could be a question mark for the year ahead.  Too early for us to say one way or the other although we are optimistic based on some of the conversations that are happening currently. The progress that we've made on working capital management has been really strong. That's one where I would tell you it's too early for us to declare victory. We're implementing new systems and processes and those are showing some value. But it's certainly difficult to use that at least above that 50% target. In terms of managing Capex, that really is the one that we're focused on. Because for us, a capital dollar really should be looked at no differently than an M&A dollar.  And if we can get a better return on invested capital from accelerating capital in our recycling business or renewable energy facilities, we're going to do that, and so while we're going to look for opportunities to accelerate capital, we're going to do so in the same prudent way that we always do from a capital allocation perspective. And look at long-term maintenance capital versus what we will consider more of a growth-oriented or investment-oriented capital decision. So that's the one place that there could be an evolution in our discussion in 2022, but no specific outlook that we can provide at this point, we'll give you more color next quarter. What's really interesting in that same three-year period that you mentioned is the impact of recycling on our margin. And I think if you stripped out a way and really consider the inflationary cost impact and the COVID impacts that we've already discussed. You are seeing strong execution on the front line of delivering that 50 basis points of margin expansion. That's why we really wanted to add the color on commodity price impact in the press release, so hopefully you can take a look at that table.  But I do think that, when we look at the collection efficiency at all of these training impacts, we've been really satisfied with the continued front-line execution of the team in delivering margin expansion though it is covered up. So, we have positive expectations for 2022 at this point though there is going to be some continued noise from the recycling part of the business. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim. And good morning. Our team continues to execute very well despite a challenging operating environment producing more than 7% percent organic revenue growth in collection and disposal business in the third quarter. This growth combined with continued integration of Advanced Disposal drove operating EBITDA more than 14% higher. As Jim mentioned, we are seeing pressure on labor and other cost categories, and we are addressing these impacts to our pricing programs to controllable cost management, efficiency improvements, and workforce planning.  Adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to a 180 basis points to 62.2% in the third quarter, as we experienced pressure from inflationary costs, supply chain constraints, and stronger-than-expected volume growth. In particular, costs-related to the hiring and training of new employees impacted labor costs in the third quarter. We also saw overtime hours increase as the team adjusted to meet the higher-than-expected collection volumes. We anticipated a good portion of this labor pressure that are showing up on our cost, as we made proactive market wage adjustments earlier in the year to get in front of labor shortages and meet growing demand. At the same time, we are working to automate a number of roles where we see longer-term challenges to attract and retain employees.  In the residential line of business, we continue to work through the last 40% of our route, including those from ADS that are not fully automated, while continuing to be very selective in the business we are willing to take on, as evidenced by our yield and volume results in the third quarter end of the last few years. While we are now incurring the cost associated with these investments, we're only in the early stages of seeing the benefits. Our labor market supply chain constraints that they accelerated in Q3, coupled with robust volume growth in the Third Quarter, have also added pressure in [Indiscernible] operations, repair and maintenance costs are increasing as we hire additional technicians and incur some overtime hours to address the strong volume growth, we continue to see in the collection lines of business.  Similarly, we've had to temporarily place some of our higher-cost trucks back in service to address the volume demands. In addition, our third-party sub-contractors, our transfer stations, are facing similar pressures and are passing those increased costs onto us. Overall, efficiency in the collection business in the third quarter, adjusting improved in the collection business in the third quarter adjusting for increased training hours. The fundamentals of our business remain strong and we are committed to recovering our cost increases through pricing and again, taking the most expensive truck off the road and reducing most expensive hour of the day. Now I want to focus on several of the positives in the quarter.  Turning to our strong revenue results, third-quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 3.8%, which outpaced our expectations. We continue to see strong volume driven by economic reopening with commercial volume up 4.6% and special waste volume up by 16.6%. And we see runway for continued solid performance in the fourth quarter. Customer metrics were also strong in the quarter. Service increase is outpaced, service decreases by more than twofold for the second consecutive quarter and churn was 8.7%. Year-to-date net new business for small and medium business customers is up more than 10%. Finally, our integration of advanced disposal continues to go smoothly.  We've combined around 70% of the acquired operations into our billing and operational systems and we remain on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. We have achieved nearly 26 million in annual run rate synergies during the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $60 million combined with the $15 million of annual run rate synergies realized in the Fourth Quarter of 2020, we're on track to reach $100 million by the end of the year. And we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of costs and capital savings. Our teams are working tirelessly to provide safe and reliable service to our customers and communities, and I want to thank them all for their efforts. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. And Tyler, I would only add that, with the additional volume I commented on in my prepared remarks, part of what we've done is we're spending a little bit more overtime in the short term to be able to go out of service and take advantage of the strong volumes. I mentioned in my comments that outpaced our expectations, which we view as a good thing over the long term. And certainly, we have a clear line of sight to what those costs are as Devina spoke to. Yes, Hamzah, good morning. I would tell you that when I look at the labor increase hold hours and this is in aggregate. About a quarter of it is related to some additional training and hiring we're doing, some of that has to do with turnover pressures that I think we're seeing, and just about everybody in a transportation industry is seeing. I think the good news is, over the last four or five months, we've actually started to make good progress in terms of our retention rates on whatnot. And I think the labor resets we talked to last quarter, which are clearly showing up in this quarter as well, are having an impact there.  The other three quarters of it, if you will, were up numbers is related to some of the OT we're incurring. Part of that, as I mentioned, is we don't view that over the long term as a bad thing because we're seeing volume increase as we are outpacing our expectations. I think as Jim mentioned previously to Tyler's question, we have a clear line of sight on what we need to do through pricing and efficiency gains, etc., and automation to be able to overcome that. I do think 70% of that index, business resetting in the first half of the year is clearly something that we're focused on, and as Jim mentioned, our pricing strategy more broadly is not going to change, our expectations will have to change to keep pace with the cost increases we've outlined. Sorry. Sorry. I knew it. So, Walter, most of the wage adjustments we spoke to in Q2 and have carried through in Q3 have really been in drivers, technicians, front-line employees, our recycling folks, etc. So, I'm taking the swag here, but it's probably 2/3 to 70% of our folks have -- are in that population in some way, shape, or form. And Greg, that's not to mention -- say that we've raised rates on every one of those employees, but we've addressed that employee group. And then the balance listen, I think everybody's in a competitive labor market right now. We're keeping a close eye on the other 30% to 35% were part of that initial push. But that's something we do on regular basis and we go through that at least annually to make sure that we're compensating all's folks adequately relative to what's going on in the market. I would tell you within WM, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, probably last 4 or 5 months, Michael, we've really started to show some progress in terms of being able to net add, if you will, month-in and month-out at some of those key positions, specifically, the driver ranks. There's still a lot of competition out there, there's still a lot of pressure, as Jim mentioned, you can't turn on the TV without hearing about some form of pressure and transportation, whether it's marine, whether it's rail or whether it's truck transportation. But as I mentioned, the good news is I think the efforts we made to make some of those wage adjustments coupled with our efforts around retention and hiring are certainly yielding positive results here for the last 4 or 5 months. Correct. Well, first I would tell you 2 things I mentioned on our prepared remarks, Michael, which are pretty familiar to you, which is the net service increases versus decreases is strong from Q2 to Q3. And then I mentioned also small and medium business, which is a traditional collection business and that I would say temporal off and the big really large accounts. We're seeing good momentum there. That was the 10% number, but I don't see in terms of capital, I mean, the capital spends there would be some incremental capital, containers and to some extent, when you guys -- we've talked about before that step function between filling up a raft and the next raft, but we don't see that as out of the ordinary capital spend. So, Sean, there's pockets of it. I mean, first and foremost, we track it, we track it everywhere every day. And all of us get to keep a close eye on that. We have seen some pockets of pressure for sure where we've had some acute turnover issues. But as we mentioned in Michael -- to the response to Michael's question, we feel like we're past the peak and we're making headway there.  To your second question, is it profound enough for us to have to concede anything on the pricing front? No, we don't think so. And I think if you look at where a lot of the -- probably with the most acute labor issue was, for us is really around if you look at our residential, and you look at our pricing -- what our pricing strategy has been and what our corporates and yield results were for the quarter and over the last number of quarters, it has not impacted us there or frankly, in any other line of business. Well, I would tell you that's where --that's one spot where technology and to some extent automations are helping. We're in the process of updating all the on-board equipment for our collection vehicles, our supervisory vehicles, with regard to being able to scan what's going on with behavioral issues, so we've got some artificial intelligence has been -- is about 70% through our entire collection fleet. They will help with things like following distance, cell phone usage, that kind of thing.  So no, I think if you look at our safety results, we've seen a little bit of pressure as we have integrated ADS, but the core WM business continues to perform well, and we're well on our way to getting ADS. The ADS business, totally tucked-in there as well. It's part of why we saw a doubling of our training hours because as we're hiring more folks, we absolutely make sure that they get fully trained. And so, we saw that 2x in our training hours, we think that number comes down as we're hiring fewer and fewer drivers and technicians. Yes, I think Jim did a good job of categorizing some of that too. I think there's a few places, steel costs, container costs, or [Indiscernible] landfill liner, those are all things that our supply chain team and the respective operating teams are keeping a close eye on. And we may make a decision to a fixed can versus buy-one while steels up 200% or whatever the number is. But that's not the bulk of it. I think Devina spoke to the majority of which is really a fleet spend some of the delays there coupled against strong volume. So that's why you talked about some of this cost pressure being somewhat acute not having confidence whether it's on a collection or the post-collection side, including the transfer of subcontractor side that we're going to be able to recover that. No David, I think overtime was up about 6% for the quarter. and yes, I do think that as we get some of these folks on board, that we've talked about it from our staffing efforts, you're going to start to see, as I mentioned in prepared remarks, take the most expensive outlaw off the street and right now, because of some of the staffing challenges, but also because we've got volume in the collection lines of business particularly commercial and industrial that really outpaced our expectations. We view that as a good problem to have long-term and the short-term, obviously we're spending a little bit some premium dollars to get that volume collected. Now that 7% to 10% is more of a core price number. I mean, that's the price increase that we're taking. So, in order to get down to yield, you have rollbacks and then there's a mix component in the yield calculation. So, you're not going to see 7% to 10% yield. But we do feel like with -- I mentioned that we've seen 8.7% labor inflation for the quarter. So, in order to cover 8.7% labor inflation and Devina and John talked a lot about the non-labor inflation that we're seeing. We do feel like we've got to take 7% to 10% price increase. So that's what that number is. Well, I think Jerry, we've obviously got in front of the wage adjustments. We started that a couple of quarters ago, really in Q2, and I think that's certainly helped the other benefits we have in place have certainly helped. And I think we're tracking the job openings obviously versus volume. And the good news is the volume is still strong. That does put some pressure on the folks that we need to recruit. But as I mentioned, for the last 4 or 5 months, we're making headway in terms of what we have versus what we need, even relative to that volume."

Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full year guidance. Now more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business have performed well above those revised expectations. In the second quarter, we achieved operating EBITDA of $1.31 billion, which we converted into strong cash from operations of more than $1 billion. First and foremost, this superb performance is a result of our outstanding core business model. In addition, this performance was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with exceptional service, offering our employees a great place to work and driving sustainability through our business model. Our very strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we are making to our business model, led us to increase our full year guidance once again. The size of our revisions in each of these first two quarters clearly demonstrates the earnings producing potential of our strategy. In the back half of the year, we expect continued strong volume, pricing that offsets inflationary pressures and record results from our commodity-based businesses. With all of this powerful momentum, we now expect to generate 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA of at least $5 billion with free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion, all while continuing to make growth investments in our sustainable solutions and technology platforms. At the core of these strong results is our recycling business, which is central to our sustainability and business strategy. Our efforts to improve the recycling business, combined with robust demand for recycled commodities, led to second quarter delivering the recycling business\u2019 best ever financial performance by a considerable margin. We have made substantial progress in de-risking our recycling business by shifting to a fee-for-service contract structure, which has lifted the floor for recycled returns and created an economically sustainable business model. We have also made significant technology investments to improve the cost structure and grow the business. At our automated facilities, labor costs were 35% lower in the second quarter compared to our other single-stream MRFs. These investments not only lower operating costs and improve plant efficiency, but also allow us to adjust our equipment to respond to evolving end-market demands. For example, we are now segregating out specific plastics that in the past were sold as a bundled lower-priced bale, reacting quickly as markets evolve for new recycled commodity types. The capability to efficiently sort these materials allows us to extract more value for these commodities as demand increases for recycled material. Overall, our investment in recycling technology \u2013 our investments in recycling technology are generating solid returns and we are accelerating our plans to roll out this new operating model across our MRF network. Sustainability has been a central part of our strategy for many years. So I want to take some time to highlight how we are advancing our sustainability journey. At the beginning of the month, Tara Hemmer transitioned into her new role as Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, bringing together our sustainable solutions and ESG efforts under one umbrella. We believe this strong focus is critical to continuing to integrate environmental sustainability and social responsibility into a strategic business framework. Our supply chain goals, which include increasing our spending, both with sustainable and diverse suppliers, are examples of how this focus is integrated in our day-to-day operations. Next month, we are hosting a supplier diversity initiative called Share the Green, which will give women-owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for one or more of the 45 companies participating in the event. This 3-day nationwide event will provide great opportunities for diverse businesses and help participating companies to secure excellent suppliers. And finally, we continue to make real progress on our digital transformation to differentiate our customers\u2019 experience. In the past, I have mentioned our automated setup process that streamlines customers\u2019 orders and reduces our cost to serve. Through our advanced technology, we are eliminating nearly all manual steps in setting up a customer count, allowing setup to occur almost instantaneously after an order is processed. This will save us several million dollars annually, improve setup accuracy and increase customer satisfaction. This more accurate setup of customers also helps us to auto-route these customers, which increases operational efficiency and will optimize routes without manual processing. We are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90% of our new commercial customers into existing routes, reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service. Our customer and digital teams continue to enhance the capabilities of our digital tools to provide a unique and engaging experience for our customers, while at the same time, connecting this front-end experience to our operational systems to allow for improved efficiency and lower costs. We expect that these investments in technology will continue to benefit us for many years to come. In conclusion, strong performance across all of our businesses, collection and disposal, recycling and renewable energy generated outstanding results so far this year. Our focus on disciplined pricing and cost management helped to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we have seen. And we expect to continue this focus into the second half of the year to help us deliver on our newly revised outlook. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the excellent second quarter results we achieved across our business. We produced exceptional EBITDA growth of almost 24% in the collection and disposal business as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic\u2019s steepest impacts in the second quarter of 2020. Collection and disposal volume climbed to 9.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. And our focus on disciplined pricing programs produced a substantive second quarter collection and disposal yield of 3.7%. Turning more specifically to our volume results, robust recovery in our highest margin businesses, commercial, industrial and landfill drove our very strong performance. In the second quarter, commercial and MSW volume reached pre-pandemic levels and industrial volumes recovered to levels just shy of those before the pandemic. While we are very pleased with the pace of volume recovery thus far, there remains opportunity for further volume improvement in the second half of the year from key areas of our business, including industrial, special waste and certain geographies such as Canada. Additionally, pockets of our commercial business, such as education and offices have yet to fully recover. For the full year, we now expect organic volume in the collection and disposal business to grow 2.5% or more. Pivoting to price, our second quarter results further demonstrate the focus the entire team has on overcoming our cost headwinds as well as improvements following the intentional customer-focused steps we took in the second quarter of 2020. This focus is particularly evident in our residential core price of 5.4%, landfill core price of 4.7% and transfer core price of 3.4%. We continue to be committed to pricing programs that are aligned with our cost structure, which is even more important as we see pressure on labor, transportation, supplies and capital costs. Our new full year outlook for collection and disposal yield is 3.0% or greater. Our strong revenue growth was also supported by great results in our customer metrics. Churn was 8.8% in the quarter and service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold. Additionally, we increased our net customer growth rate driven by optimization of our sales force and investments in technology. Looking at operating costs, second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 10 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are continuing to manage our cost as volumes recover even in the face of inflationary cost pressures. It\u2019s no surprise to anyone who follows economic indicators that most businesses are experiencing inflation in their costs throughout 2021 and our business is no exception, particularly with regard to labor. We expect to overcome these pressures by increasing operating efficiencies and executing on our disciplined pricing programs. There is no silver bullet when it comes to attracting and retaining talent and we are using a multifaceted approach that includes addressing wages, offering flexible schedules and broadening benefits. Our long-term focus is on keeping our people first so that we are the employer of choice. Overall, inflation trends are something we are watching very closely and managing very proactively with our area, supply chain and revenue management teams. We continue to make progress on the integration of the advanced disposal operations. To-date, we have combined around 45% of the ADS operations into our billing and operational systems, which has allowed us to capture synergies and provide additional services to those customers. We are on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we have achieved more than $30 million of annual run-rate synergies and we expect cost synergies of between $80 million and $85 million in 2021. This will bring the annual run-rate synergies to around $100 million at the end of 2021 and we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings. And finally, as Jim mentioned, our recycling team set new highs in the second quarter with record contributions to earnings and margins. We also achieved strong growth in our renewable energy business as we generated and sold more RINs and sold them at higher prices. We have made significant investments in these businesses in recent years and we are pleased with the strong returns they are generating. Before I turn the call over to Devina, I want to thank the entire WM team for the remarkable job they have done in managing our operations and providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Our people really are the foundation of our success. And with that, I will hand off to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John and good morning. Our team once again delivered strong performance in the second quarter. Robust volume growth since last year\u2019s peak pandemic impact, dynamic pricing efforts, record recycling results, disciplined integration of the ADS business, and our continued focus on cost management combined to deliver 28% operating EBITDA growth and 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As Jim mentioned, these outstanding results and our confidence in the continued strength of our business model have led us to raise our 2021 financial guidance yet again. Full year revenue growth is now expected to be 15.5% to 16%, with organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 5.5% or greater. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we expect to generate between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, an increase of $225 million at the midpoint from the original guidance we provided in February. Our business is exceeding the strong outlook we established at the beginning of the year on a number of fronts. Volume has recovered, particularly in the commercial collection business at a faster rate than we expected. Market values for recycled commodities and RINs have increased. Our integration of the ADS business has generated more synergy value. And certain of our technology investments focused on reducing our cost to serve have delivered more savings than planned. While the bridge from our initial guidance to the current guidance has a number of puts and takes, the most significant drivers are at accelerated price and volume recoveries in the collection and disposal business of about $135 million; improved recycling profitability of another $135 million; renewable energy increases of about $55 million; and additional ADS synergies of around $25 million. These increases are partially offset by elevated cost inflation and incentive compensation costs that we currently estimate to be about $125 million. The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA guidance is expected to translate directly into incremental free cash flow and we now expect that we will generate between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of free cash flow for the year. Turning to our second quarter results, SG&A was 9.6% of revenue in the second quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over 2020. This result demonstrates our success-making incremental technology investments that will benefit our customer engagement and cost to serve over the long-term. At the same time, we are realizing benefits from the integration of ADS and returns on certain of our new technology solutions. We also continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending to optimize our costs. Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities grew more than 20%. This increase was driven by our extremely strong operating EBITDA growth. There was an unfavorable working capital comparison in the second quarter, but we attribute that to timing differences in tax payments and cash received from CNG credits. We are encouraged to see continued progress on our DSO and DPO measures. In the second quarter, capital spending was $396 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 to just over $665 million. While capital spending in the first half of the year was expected to be less than prior year due to timing differences in truck delivery schedules, our 2021 pace of capital expenditures has been slower than we planned. The slower pace is due to supply chain and labor constraints impacting some of our vendors and we have made deliberate decisions to defer spending in some categories as we observe what we expect to be temporary dislocation in certain markets. To offset these delays, we are proactively pulling forward capital investments in areas we can and also where we know the returns will be strong. As Jim mentioned, we are in the process of accelerating recycling investments as we have strong proof points of technology and equipment upgrades, reducing the cost structure of the business and improving delivered quality of processed materials. We continue to target full year capital spending within our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range. In the first half of 2021, our business generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion, a conversion from operating EBITDA of 61%. This very strong result positions us well to achieve our new higher free cash flow outlook even as we target capital spending increases in the second half of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business, and strong and consistent shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we paid $242 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Our leverage ratio of 2.84x has improved even more quickly than expected due to our strong operating EBITDA growth and it\u2019s tracking well toward our target leverage of 2.75x by the end of the year. At the same time, our robust cash generation in the first half of the year positions us to increase our full year share repurchase expectation up to our full $1.35 billion authorization. With this increase, we expect our weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 422 million shares. Thanks to the hard work of every member of the WM team. We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial results. The successes of the first half of 2021 position WM to deliver on our commitments to our people, our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. With that, Holly, let\u2019s open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning all.\nJim Fish: Good morning, Tyler.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Jim, obviously a great quarter. I know there has been a lot of talk about labor of late. You touched on it in your prepared remarks, but can you just talk about labor availability, how it\u2019s impacting the business? Is this more of a cost issue or is it actually precluding revenue opportunities and then are there any indications that it\u2019s easing or is it actually getting worse?\nJim Fish: We are seeing it easing at this point, because we are hiring. And as Devina went through the numbers and John as well, we have had to hire at a higher rate. I think Devina mentioned $125 million as kind of a combination of incentive compensation and higher costs. And so those higher costs, in large part, are due to some of these inflationary pressures that we are seeing on the labor line. And so if I use June as an example, I think the number is \u2013 we hired 685 mostly drivers and technicians in the month of June. And it wasn\u2019t just churning people, because we had 125 who left. So, the net addition was pretty significant to replace some of these folks that have decided to sit on the sidelines, because of the government programs that are out there. I would tell you those government programs are affecting not just us they are affecting big and small businesses. And right now, at least in the United States, the federal benefits are scheduled to roll off on the 6th of September. It\u2019s not a stretch to say that there isn\u2019t a business out there that isn\u2019t looking forward to the 6th of September. To your first question about whether it is precluding growth or just creating some difficulties on it with existing customers, I think it\u2019s much more of the latter. I don\u2019t see it keeping us from growing and that\u2019s reflected mostly in our volume figures.\nTyler Brown: Okay, okay. Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. And then Devina, do you specifically have what the average commodity value was for Q2 and then where is that commodity value today and basically, what is in the back half guide?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So in the second quarter, it was just above $100 per ton on a mix basis. Our second half guide is a little over $117 a ton, bringing the full year outlook to an average of $104. July did see some really nice uptick from June levels. And for context purposes, June was at about $114 a ton. So, that gives you an indication that we are on the right track for our outlook for the remainder of the year.\nTyler Brown: Okay.\nJim Fish: Tyler, real quick one kind of indication as we think about recycled commodity prices is that we do believe we are on a longer term bullish trend here and there is a couple of reasons for that. One is we think there is a permanent shift that\u2019s taking place, particularly as you think about OCC, but also plastics. Just to give you one other data point here, when we think about OCC pricing and how much room it has to go, we are 17% above historical averages at the end of the second quarter, but we are still 40% below all-time highs. So, we think there still is room to go. And as we and other companies are kind of moving forward, this ESG movement is really gaining traction. We think that commodities like plastics will continue to increase in price. So, we are encouraged by the pricing trends and we don\u2019t think they are the same kind of ebbs and flows that were short-lived in the past. We think these are longer term.\nTyler Brown: Okay, great. I know it will probably be a long call so I will turn it over. Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone.\nJim Fish: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: Jim, Devina, can you talk about how much CapEx opportunities you have over the next couple of years to deploy towards recycling to landfill gas development? What\u2019s the opportunity set, because the payback periods look pretty attractive across those investment sets? And so I am just curious if you could quantify the pipeline for us and maybe provide the context on the opportunity set between the two? Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So, over the last few years, we had invested about $100 million annually in the recycling line of business and we had plans to continue at that pace. But as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are looking to accelerate that pace. And in the back half of the year, we are targeting somewhere upwards of $65 million or more in incremental capital spend in the recycling line of business relative to what our plans were because that is one of the places we see some opportunity to pull things forward both from a return profile and not an area where we\u2019ve seen a significant impact from supply chain constraints. In the renewable energy business, I would say it\u2019s been a little more peaks and valleys with regard to our investment trend historically. But when we look forward, the pipeline for continued investment is very strong. We have one additional project that will complete in 2021, and we are already looking at somewhere around five or more for the years to come. We are still in the process of considering whether or not that\u2019s something that we do ourselves or that we look to do in partnership with others because this is a place where not only is there reason for us to consider preserving our capital for high-growth opportunities in the traditional collection and disposal business, but there is also tremendous interest in this type of investment in the space at sustainability and projects like this that are so unique in terms of opportunity can create incremental value. But your point about the returns on them is spot on, really good payback periods on both recycling and renewable energy.\nJerry Revich: And in terms of just to shift gears, the collection yield was obviously impressive this quarter and it sounds like that surprised the upside as well. Can you just talk about what aspects relative to your plan, a surprise to the upside would be geographic or line of business? And do you view the 4%-plus yield in collection as sustainable into the back half of the year when the comps look a little tougher?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So, I think what\u2019s important here is that when we look at our pricing performance in the first half of 2021, it really did impress us to the upside on just about every line of business. John talked a great deal about the residential line of business and our intentional efforts there to improve profitability. But most importantly, I think you saw really strong pricing in industrial and commercial collection and then also the steps that we are taking to continue to drive price in the landfill line of business. Our outlook for second half because of the year-over-year comp is that we will have yield in the range of 2.75% to 3% in the back half of the year, and that\u2019s just representative of a more normalized pricing range that we had in the second half of 2020 relative to the second quarter of last year when we took those proactive steps that were really focused on customer retention and taking care of our customers in a desperate time of need, so really strong outlook for the second half. I would tell you that I am optimistic that there could be strength over and above even what our outlook presents currently.\nJerry Revich: Terrific. I appreciate the discussion. Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: Thank you very much. So, if we start with the capital spending, can you get the midpoint spent that\u2019s left, which is about $1.2 billion, given the supply disruptions even if you pull forward?\nDevina Rankin: Our current outlook says we can get there. I am less optimistic today than I was when we gave our guidance at the end of the first quarter, which is why we came off at the high end of the range that we had previously spoken to. I would tell you, there is no shortage of opportunity for us to invest in the business. And we are going after that opportunity in a very targeted way. And as I mentioned, the recycling line of business, in particular, is a place that we are accelerating. It\u2019s good for us to try and pull some of what we can forward so that we don\u2019t create too much of a headwind in 2022 for capital because there are things that we see pushing into that year that we would have expected to spend currently such as landfill airspace capacity where we have seen liner costs and availability be slower than what we would have expected.\nMichael Hoffman: And just to tease that out a little bit, most of you on the bigger companies locked in slots in pricing in \u201821. Are they going to honor the price if it gets\u2026?\nDevina Rankin: So I lost you there, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: Sorry, there was just call waiting just beeped into me. The \u2013 you locked in your slots in 2021 for your trucks at a good price. You are not bearing some of that inflation yet. Are they going to honor those prices going into \u201822 if the supply issues delay deliveries?\nDevina Rankin: Absolutely, and it\u2019s a great point. So, on the truck side in particular, it\u2019s all about making sure that we are positioned well for deliveries on a ready schedule. John will give a little more color on that, but we do have strong commitments both for the remainder of 2021 and early into 2022.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Michael, I think where we are seeing some pressure is on the container side with steel prices. So, some \u2013 we are making some decisions on fixed versus buy there, but that would be normal. And to Devina\u2019s earlier point, we are seeing stress on the supply chain with some other commodity-based materials. We are pushing some, when I think about landfill liner and those kind of things, not going to affect the business, but whether we buy now or push off our decisions we are making with the supply chain team day in and day out.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then Devina, you are on \u2013 your guidance puts you at a 50% free cash flow conversion rate on the low end at $5 billion and $2.5 billion. Is that a new baseline, 50%? Is that the way to think about the business going into the next year and beyond?\nDevina Rankin: So, I think the baseline conversation is one we really want to more fully discuss as we get later into the year. But we are really excited about the baseline that we have established. We are making progress on the working capital front, and we have certainly also made progress in terms of the investments that we are making in capital expenditures paying strong returns. The place I would give a little bit of caution with respect to that being the right number is the recycling and renewable energy business is providing a lift from a flow-through perspective. And you are not having to make an incremental capital investment to get that dollar. We did have a low bonus payment in 2021 as a result of the poor performance in 2020, and that will have an opposite impact in the year ahead. And then there is also some uncertainty in what corporate taxes look like in 2022. But I will tell you that the returns that we are seeing on our technology investments, the reduced interest run rate that we have established, given the recent debt transaction, having ADS fully integrated in the year ahead and just the general strong performance of the collection and disposal business, all of those things do provide upside. And so we are optimistic that we can maintain that 50%, but there is a little bit of caution that\u2019s prudent.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, fair enough. And last one for me, Jim. I appreciate the demand side of sustainability, lifting commodity values structurally and this is the hard part of modeling. There is also a supply issue going on and disruption. So at some level, even if the next low is a much higher low, this is a tough question because it\u2019s \u2013 what are we at risk at? And then I am comparing it to your last peak, which is 2017. And yet the business model is different because in 2017, it was commodity-based. Today, it\u2019s 60% fee-based. So, how do we, as modelers, think about managing risk around that recycling revenue line?\nJim Fish: I think we have done a good job over the last couple of years since the last peak of really de-risking the recycling business overall, so that when we do have these kind of high highs or low lows, we tend to smooth those out. And then really, it\u2019s more smoothing out the low lows than smoothing out the high highs. We would like to take advantage of these very high prices when they get there, but not taking on the chin when we have the very low prices and so some of that de-risking is moving to a fee-based model. Some of it has \u2013 and that has really proven to be successful for us. Some of it is the new technology that John and I mentioned, putting that into our network so that we operate those at a lower-cost structure. I mentioned 35% difference between the kind of the next-gen plants versus current plants. And Devina mentioned an acceleration of CapEx there pulling that forward. So, that\u2019s a way that I think we mitigate some of this. And then I do believe that it probably was \u2013 while it didn\u2019t feel like that at the time, it was probably a good thing that we ultimately lost our biggest customer in recycling, which was China a couple of years ago because now it\u2019s all moved \u2013 a lot of that\u2019s moved back to state side and is more predictable. And so I think the recycling business has changed a lot from when we had our last peak, which was, as you said, 2017 and it\u2019s changed for the better and I think it\u2019s changed permanently.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay, fair enough. Thanks very much.\nJim Fish: Thanks Michael.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Goldstein with Morgan Stanley.\nJeff Goldstein: Hi, good morning. Just on the volumes first, are you able to add some color to the volume growth by geography? And I think you mentioned continued Canada softness in your prepared remarks. But are the best performing volumes at this point now just the places that shutdown the hardest and now have the easiest comps or is it more nuanced than that? And then just in terms of volume trends, are you able to talk to the month-over-month trends and if that continued to get better throughout the quarter and now that July is almost done here?\nJim Fish: Sure, Jeff. Really, the only kind of persistent slowness that we are seeing right now is in Canada. And I looked at July\u2019s numbers again this morning and that\u2019s still there. The encouraging part about Canada is it looks like it\u2019s going to reopen fully sometime in the next two weeks to three weeks, so that is encouraging for us. But it hasn\u2019t been great, and it has been kind of three months to six months behind the United States. So, July\u2019s numbers still look soft in Canada. That\u2019s really the biggest geographic difference for us. I think when you \u2013 John mentioned that commercial has fully recovered when you really compare to 2019 \u2013 2020 comparisons, for obvious reasons, are not really meaningful. But when you start comparing to 2019, commercial has fully recovered. But it\u2019s only about 0.5% above 2019. We really haven\u2019t seen kind of the growth aspect of the economy hit that commercial line of business. And then maybe most encouraging of all for us individually and then also on a more macro basis for the overall economy, are our C&D and special waste streams. And when we look sequentially at how they did, I mean, those two waste streams took the biggest hit of anything last year during COVID. And so they have seen the biggest sequential improvement, so they are on a great upward track. And I think those two by themselves, which tend to be kind of the most forward-looking indicators for us, are the best barometer overall of not only our business going forward, but maybe even the North American economies, a good macro sign for the comp.\nJeff Goldstein: Great, that was all very helpful color. And then just a question on the 2-year to 3-year pricing outlook as we sit here today, maybe just some broad strokes, because I am just thinking with your index contracts re-pricing on a lag and that figure looking like it should accelerate next year, is it safe to say your pricing in \u201822 should be above whatever you print this year? Just how should we think about the potential for price to continue to improve into next year and beyond that, really?\nJim Fish: Yes. So, let me \u2013 I am going to let John chime in on the resi piece real quick. I will just give you a little bit of my kind of overview on pricing. First of all, we were \u2013 when we looked at our pricing numbers, again, another metric that\u2019s not overly meaningful year-over-year, because as you recall, last year, we really put the brakes on with respect to some of our pricing actions. But when you look sequentially at what we did in terms of collection price and in terms of landfill price, that\u2019s what gives us \u2013 that\u2019s what makes us feel most encouraged about the potential going forward. And to Devina\u2019s points, that is an area of confidence for us. The team understands that pricing is critical to cost recovery, but that it\u2019s also critical to margin expansion. So, we are not just looking at this as a cost recovery mechanism. Part of the success for the quarter was that we did use pricing to recover some of those cost pressures that we have discussed. But it also helped us expand margins. And that really is the plan going into 2022, that we will continue to use price to offset what we expect will be some continued inflation, not as aggressive of inflation figures we are seeing now because some of this, we believe, is temporary, as I mentioned earlier, caused by some of the current government\u2019s benefits. But there is some \u2013 feels like some structural inflation in the system. Pricing will help us more than recover that and will be a good thing for us going forward. And John, maybe you can talk about resi pricing a bit.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Jeff, and I think on resi, you heard that in some of our prepared comments, strong yield at 4.7 for the quarter, up from year-to-date. Same thing with core price. We did shed a little bit of volume, but I happen to know that, in fact, one big franchise we had in the Southeast which was underperforming and we made a decision to move it up and instead it went out. And I think what you are seeing though is continued and increasing benefit from our focus on moving the residential number and not to be \u2013 and part of that, you heard a lot of conversation about recycling. Part of fixing residential, I have said this on a few calls, is fixing recycling because about two-thirds of what we process comes from a residential stream that either we collect or another vendor collects. So, long story short, we feel good overall about our pricing strategy, the consistency and the upward trend. And specifically on residential, we expect to continue on a trend as well.\nJeff Goldstein: Alright. That was all very helpful and congrats again on the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Hi, good morning and thank you. Could you maybe talk about what you are expecting in terms of pace of labor hiring, specifically headcount? I know, Jim, you talked about a June number, could you talk about \u2013 is that the pace we should expect for the second half? I know stimulus comes off, so maybe labor shortages kind of go away, but any thoughts there?\nJohn Morris: Good morning Hamzah. What I would tell you is that Jim pointed to June as being a particularly strong month. But really our progress on the hiring front really started four months or five months ago. As we started to get more confidence in what was coming back in terms of post-COVID recovery, we tried to get out in front of us. So, we have been making steady progress really for the last four months or five months. It really flipped in June and we really saw the fruits of our labor take hold. I would expect that going forward for the next handful of months we are going to continue at a similar pace. Keep in mind though, to the extent we talked about volume recovery and what lines of business is coming from, coupled with, as an example, in residential, where we may shed a little bit of volume going forward to get the right margins, we have to balance all those things out. But I think Jim\u2019s commentary around what we did in June is something you can expect from us for the next handful of months.\nJim Fish: Well, Hamzah, I have also said a number of times that we are looking at this somewhat opportunistically. If the high of kind of available folks who would work for this company is shrinking. And look, I have heard that from my 18-year-old daughter that people aren\u2019t interested in her high school \u2013 senior high school class in driving trucks. Then that actually is okay for us as long as we get ours. And that\u2019s what I have said is, if we get ours and the pie is shrinking, I don\u2019t care about the rest of the pie. All I care about is ours. And so there is kind of an opportunistic approach to this. But to John\u2019s point, I mean, I think we are getting ours. It hasn\u2019t been a completely smooth road for us, to be honest. But I think we are getting to a point. And certainly, September 6 will be helpful for everyone when these benefits roll off.\nHamzah Mazari: Good, very helpful. And then just my second question just is around M&A. And the question really is your leverage will be 2.75x, I think you said, by the end of the year. You are clearly generating a lot of cash flow, free cash. Could you talk about M&A in terms of outside the solid waste business, particularly you mentioned recycling investments and you mentioned plastics. Are there technologies that can scale in plastics or I know you are using maybe venture capital and investing in those funds versus actually buying technology, but just broad thoughts on M&A outside the core solid waste business longer term?\nJim Fish: Sure. So by the way, to your point about our balance sheet, I mean, it\u2019s a compliment to Devina and John and the whole team for really getting our balance sheet back down to where we said it would be by the end of the year, and that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s pretty impressive that through this acquisition, we are already down below 3x against down, I think, 2.85x. So regarding M&A, Hamzah, outside of core, the \u2013 and you mentioned specifically plastics, I think you are aware of the ownership position we have in the company called Continuous Materials, and that company does turn plastics and paper \u2013 low-value plastics and mixed papers into a roofing material. And we have a 33% ish investments in them at this point. So, that \u2013 we are excited about the potential for that. And it helps us take some of that material that might otherwise find its way to a landfill, pull it out of the landfill because it doesn\u2019t do anything in terms of creating any gas or anything usable coming out of the landfill and doing something that\u2019s preferable in terms of kind of ESG, but also preferable financially for us. So, we will look for those types of investments. We are cautious about big acquisitions regardless, but particularly cautious about big non-core acquisitions. I just don\u2019t want to step on a landmine here as we are walking down a pretty nice path and that could be a landmine if we were to do something like that. So, we are not opposed to doing non-core acquisitions. We want to make sure that we have a lot of intelligence in those before we do anything. And I would be surprised, very surprised if you would see us do anything large in the non-core space.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Very helpful. Just lastly, I will turn it over, it\u2019s just a clarification or just an update. Could you update us how much of your book of business is CPI indexed? And is it just a straight LTM CPI it adjusts to or are there other indexes? And what is that running today? Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. We are at about 40%, Hamzah, and there is a mix there in terms of whether it\u2019s CPI flat or the Waste Sewer Trash index. We continue to prioritize a push towards WST, though I would tell you that we see strength in the CPI numbers and therefore view that as something that provides some incremental value, particularly in the second half of the year but then looking forward into 2022 as well.\nJohn Morris: Yes. I think Hamzah, whether CPI has been up or down, we have always \u2013 we have been demonstrating for the last more than a handful of years that regardless of what\u2019s going on with CPI, we are going to make sure we price the business to at least cover our costs and expand margin.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Thanks for taking my questions. It looks like this recycling commodity rebates is a new disclosure unless I am mistaken. It would be great to just quickly walk through the mechanics of that. I guess those kick in at a certain basket value in recycling. Any help just understanding that number and the mechanics would be helpful, especially maybe in reference to how it\u2019s built in, in the second half would be great.\nDevina Rankin: Sure, Sean. So, this is a new disclosure that we are making, and as the leading commentary on the table suggests, what we are attempting to do here is just provide clarity where there is a bit of inconsistency across the industry. And one of the things in particular that\u2019s really important in this business is conversation about operating EBITDA margin. And for WM in Q2 of 2021, on an apples-to-apples basis as best we can when we compare across the business, our operating EBITDA results were 31.2% for the quarter when you compare with this approach more similarly aligned with one of our competitors in particular. And all we are doing here, you can look at the operating expense table that\u2019s in the 10-Q and what you see there is the cost of goods sold line, and that includes rebates that we pay in the recycling line of business. That\u2019s the driver of that cost category. And what we are doing here is reflecting that if you were to net that against the associated revenues rather than grossing it up between revenue and operating expenses. The impact to our margin is 130 basis points in the quarter. The increase on a year-over-year basis reflects the strength of commodity prices, which we have talked about. And so naturally, with the continued strength and outlook for even better year-over-year comps in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year, you would expect that to expand further from the 130 basis points that we measured in the second quarter. But really, for us, this is about comparability and trying to enhance that across the space.\nSean Eastman: Okay, got it. I think I am going to have to spend some time with that on that one. Secondly, we haven\u2019t talked too much about ADS. It seems like the integration is going quite smoothly. Any color on the strength in the ADS book of business from a pricing program perspective and whether, even just anecdotally, you have uncovered some of the cross-sell opportunities that aren\u2019t fully reflected in that synergy target?\nJohn Morris: Hi, good morning Sean. Yes, I would say the integration continues to go really well. You heard in my prepared remarks about our confidence around overall cost, SG&A synergies and reiterating that we still think when it\u2019s all said and done, we will have $150 million of total synergies by 2023. And you also heard from me that we are just about 45% of the way through taking that data from ADS\u2019 databases and moving that over to WM. So, that\u2019s allowing us to \u2013 when you think about routing efficiencies and the other logistical benefits from combining the customer base, you heard that as well in my prepared comments. And I think from a revenue standpoint, as we are moving that business in and it becomes WM business and it goes into portfolio and we are going to manage it in a similar fashion, we manage the rest of our business.\nSean Eastman: Okay, terrific. Thanks. I will turn it over.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much, operator. Good morning everyone. I guess my first question here is back on M&A, and obviously, we\u2019ve heard an executive order from President Biden that seems to be singling out larger companies in respective industries that are exercising some pricing power. And while Waste doesn\u2019t necessarily get flagged in that, do you see any increased scrutiny by the DOJ, any increased pressure, any change in approach that they might take toward looking at deals that you might do in the future that would put at risk any of your ability to grow by acquisition at a pace that you otherwise would have if this order hadn\u2019t come through?\nJohn Morris: Yes. I mean, look, to be honest, we haven\u2019t seen anything. I mean, we all read the news and we read comments and so you can kind of take those for whatever they are worth. But when we really look at some of the tuck-ins that we\u2019ve done post-ADS, I mean, we haven\u2019t seen anything at this point. What we are hearing that\u2019s not related in really any way to your question but is more about M&A is that it\u2019s somewhat related, I guess, to the new administration because if there is a tax change, we are seeing that there are some companies out there that are becoming sellers because of this prospective change in tax law. Similarly, we\u2019re seeing some folks that are saying, what, I don\u2019t like the labor environment right now. And they are looking at selling for that reason. And then the third thing we\u2019re hearing is that in our industry, with some of these small businesses, there just isn\u2019t, in many cases, a robust succession plan for some of these companies. So I think it\u2019s not directly related to your question about DOJ, but it is related to some of the things that are happening within the current administration, whether it\u2019s subsidies for unemployed or whether it is related to tax law changes. But DOJ, we\u2019re not seeing anything at this point.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then turning to residential volumes, obviously coming up against tougher comps here and I\u2019m curious whether we are seeing, and it would make sense to see, just want to confirm residential volumes now coming down as people get back to work. But the key question here is that is there structurally anything \u2013 any changes that you\u2019ve made during COVID-19 that would \u2013 with your contract on the residential side, that would change what otherwise would be what we would expect with a slowdown in \u2013 or a decline in residential volumes so that the impact would be less onerous or perhaps would be complemented here based on the mix as we see residential volumes come off on a year-over-year basis.\nJohn Morris: Yes. Well, there are a few things. We are \u2013 we have seen a little bit of moderation as folks have returned back to their place of work. But there is going to be a little bit of a lingering effect because I think the workforce is going to change a little bit. You\u2019re going to see some more folks work remotely or from home. But that doesn\u2019t look meaningful. We have seen a little bit, Jim commented on this earlier, we have seen a little bit of a shift in the residential recycling stream. Obviously, Amazon is doing well. We\u2019re seeing it show up in the percentage of cardboard that\u2019s coming out or fiber is coming out of a lot of our residential contracts, which is honestly a good thing, especially in this environment. We are seeing some improvement, although not as significant by weight, if you will, in terms of the quality and quantity of some of the higher-margin streams. We talked specifically about plastics and the kind of mixed plastic we use to make versus the specific plastic products that we\u2019re producing for customers. So we view that all as positive. I think overall in general volume in terms of units I don\u2019t think our message has changed. We\u2019re going to continue to make sure that we move residential from a margin perspective up to where it competes with every other line of business. And we\u2019re really making good progress there. And if you look at our price versus volume in the last handful of quarters, it has been slightly negative. But if you look at the core price and yields compared to that, that\u2019s certainly a trade-off we are willing to make. As I\u2019ve said before, we don\u2019t want to \u2013 we\u2019re not trying to push the volume out but we\u2019re going to make sure that the investments we\u2019re making in that line of business align with our overall long-term strategy from a profit and return standpoint.\nDevina Rankin: So John really covered the substance and the business drivers very well. Walter, one kind of clarifying facts that I just want to be sure is clear for us is that the volume decline that you\u2019re seeing is different from container weight. And so the shift that we\u2019re seeing as people return to their workplaces and less people are working from home is more about the container weight, the volume measure that you\u2019re seeing in those intentional steps that we\u2019ve taken that John has spoken about to be very prudent in terms of making incremental investments in the residential line of business with our capital and with our workforce where we are seeing constraints. And that\u2019s business that we knew that we would be shedding and shedding with purpose.\nWalter Spracklin: Great. Appreciate the time as always.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you, Walter.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning, Jim, John and Devina. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019d like to pick up on Michael\u2019s earlier observation about sustainability fueling the higher demand for recycling to really try to understand how you see this opportunity for the company. Just given the acceleration in corporate commitments to recycle and use recycled content, I think the U.S. Plastics Pact, which has 100 corporate signatories. They just unveiled their road map to 2025. And at the same time, it really seems like there is still a pretty big infrastructure gap around recycling these materials and getting them back to those producers. You just look at the difference between the commingled bales and the individual grades of plastics. So would just love to understand kind of your road map for how this is a growth opportunity for the company, both in terms of putting in more infrastructure in terms of helping to close the loop and getting some of these materials back to the manufacturers and then being able to potentially capture organic share gains with those types of manufacturers as a result.\nJim Fish: Well, no, I think you\u2019ve hit on kind of the key macroeconomic piece here, which is that finally, it looks like demand is catching up with supply. We\u2019ve always had the supply, but we haven\u2019t, until fairly recently, had as much demand as we would like. We\u2019ve had demand but maybe not as much as we would like. And I think what we\u2019re seeing is that companies are now, with this real focus on virtually every company, ESG focus, are inclined to use recycled material, recycled \u2013 improve the recycled content percentages. So that\u2019s been a benefit for us. There is still, to your point, there still is opportunity, I think, to expand infrastructure, particularly here in the U.S., but we are seeing it \u2013 we\u2019re seeing encouraging signs there. And we have outlets through our brokerage group outside of the United States, which has been one of the real benefits there. When China went away literally overnight, our brokerage team was able to move commodities pretty quickly to other spots, other places around the world. And we still have those and we will continue to move commodities there. But I do like the long-term trends not only for our recycling business but as someone who\u2019s is very focused on the environment. I like the fact that we\u2019re moving to becoming more ESG-focused and that we\u2019re \u2013 the companies that are using and producing materials are looking to use recycled content as opposed to just using virgin content.\nNoah Kaye: Great. And I guess the follow-up to that would be, you mentioned some of the significant savings around automation in the MRFs, labor and otherwise. Have you really seen a lot of innovation in the last few years, I guess, following China National around those pieces of equipment, those technologies that are driving these returns? Is there more innovation coming down the pike? I guess what I\u2019m basically asking is, is the rate of technology innovation in and around recycling improving at a rate that supports some of these demand and commitments from the eventual buyers of the content?\nJohn Morris: Yes. No, I think that\u2019s a great question. I think what you see in the numbers that we referenced around how we\u2019re \u2013 how pleased we are with the investments we made in this advanced and advancing technology, I think that supports the model. We are very pleased with the plants that we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve invested in thus far. Jim mentioned the labor arbitrage, that we\u2019re benefiting from that. And by the way, that\u2019s not just labor for labor\u2019s sake, those are positions that are certainly been and continue to be hard to fill so it\u2019s solving a few problems there. I think around the demand of the customer, we all mentioned that, that side of the equation is as strong now as it\u2019s ever been. And for all the comments made around ESG, we feel confident that, that\u2019s going to continue to grow. And I think plastics is one example. I mean, we\u2019ve got the material stream either through our plants or through in other parts of the waste stream. And what you\u2019re seeing is some migration from what was in the waste stream obviously now to higher-value commodities. And Devina said this not today but on other calls, when you look at it from a return \u2013 a return on invested capital standpoint, our recycle plants are at the top of the heap. So to the extent we keep investing more CapEx there, we\u2019re going to be very pleased with that. And we think that the technology is advancing in a form and fashion that\u2019s going to allow us to continue to meet the customers\u2019 demands.\nNoah Kaye: Great. Thanks very much for the color. Nice job and best of luck.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, Noah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC.\nKevin Chiang: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one for me and maybe on the ESG angle as well. Can you just give us an update on your EV strategy here? I think you\u2019re evaluating a couple of trucks. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of, when do you think you need to make a larger order to kind of hit some of your emission reduction targets? And I guess, how do you balance the technology you\u2019re seeing now versus maybe what\u2019s in the development pipeline, whether it\u2019s solid state or fuel cell, when you think of making this fleet transition?\nJohn Morris: Hey, Kevin. Good morning. No, good question. When we get often and what I said on the last call publicly in other venues is we are working with a number of vendors to watch to see how the battery technology is advancing. As I said before, I think naturally, we\u2019re going to \u2013 we were seeing it in the passenger vehicles and we will probably see in light-duty vehicles. In some cases, we\u2019re seeing it already. So we\u2019ve got a number of vendors we\u2019re working with to watch the way the different technologies advance. I would tell you in terms of our strategy on fleet, we\u2019ve said before, we\u2019ve pivoted from the traditional diesel fleet that we had to CNG. I wouldn\u2019t say it was seamlessly but the way our fleet plan works is we have some flexibility to be able to move from diesel to CNG, and we view it as CNG to battery electric vehicles the same way. I would tell you what I think will happen is and I talked about this at the conference, Devina and I were at a few weeks ago at WasteExpo, I am confident that over time, they are going to solve the weight issue, the range issue, the [indiscernible] of a refuse vehicle, all those things, I think will get solved. I think the bigger question is the infrastructure piece. And we are also watching that to see what kind of infrastructure we would need in our distributed environment to be able to service a fleet of 20,000 vehicles.\nKevin Chiang: That\u2019s helpful. Just as a clarification, when you think of that problem being solved, is it within kind of the construct of a lithium-ion battery? Or do you think it\u2019s an evolution from this, either using fuel cell extenders or even moving to a different propulsion system?\nJohn Morris: Kevin, I would \u2013 that\u2019s something I think is a little bit still a little murky at this point. That\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re working with a handful of different vendors just to make sure we\u2019ve got our eye on all the different potential solutions to your good question.\nKevin Chiang: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I will leave it there. Thank you very much and great quarter guys.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber: Thank you so much. Wanted to move over to the legislative and regulatory side, I believe earlier this week, the House pushed through a potential bill on PFAS to require the EPA to establish national drinking water standards. Can you give us an update on what you think is going on there and how long the time line is going to be for this?\nJim Fish: I don\u2019t know that we know exactly what the time line is. We saw that as well. Maybe a bit more of a kind of a macro answer to that is that we do look at PFAS as being a cost impact to us, but we look at it as a much bigger opportunity for us than a cost impact. We know there may be some added costs, albeit something we have had our eye on for quite some time and have been honestly working with EPA on it for quite some time. But we also really are looking at this with a pretty interested eye because once we do know those details that you referenced there, I think it really opens up a big opportunity for us. And so we\u2019re \u2013 I\u2019m not sure it might be overstating to say we\u2019re excited about it, but we do \u2013 we are encouraged that this could be a big stream, revenue stream for us. But at this point, it still is \u2013 I\u2019ll use John\u2019s words, it still is a little bit murky. And we don\u2019t know exactly what the details are going to be on how they \u2013 what they say about PFAS. But for example, we\u2019re \u2013 it feels a little bit like it\u2019s coal combustion residual part two.\nJeff Silber: Okay, interesting. And then continuing this theme, we\u2019re also hearing and reading a lot more on the EPR side. I know it\u2019s big in Canada and we\u2019re seeing some things going on in specific states in the U.S. Again, if you can give us an update there from your perspective, what you think the impact might be on your business.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Jeff, our entire team is following what\u2019s going on with EPR. And I think our position is still the same, which is we feel like we have the assets, the infrastructure, the network to solve for a lot of the challenges that come out of EPR. So to the extent we can continue to maximize use of our assets, I think we\u2019re \u2013 we understand that. But that, too, is a little bit \u2013 there is still some wood to chop on that front as well. I know there is some things that are unique going up in Canada but I think we\u2019re well positioned there as well with \u2013 in terms of assets to help solve for that challenge.\nJeff Silber: Okay. Appreciate the color. Thanks so much.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jeff.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: Hi. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Last quarter, you mentioned that you expected landfill yield in particular to be strong. I\u2019m wondering this quarter, was it up to your expectations? And just could you give us a bit of an outlook on that business, in particular, landfill yield?\nDevina Rankin: The landfill yield was slightly above our expectations in the second quarter, I would say not as much above expectations as, say, C&I was. And we do expect it to moderate somewhat from the second quarter levels, that we\u2019re still encouraged that with our focus on MSW pricing in particular and then the strong pipeline that we have from a volume perspective in C&D and special waste, that, that will give some natural lift to yields in the back half of the year as those streams tend to have strong pricing that\u2019s more difficult to predict specifically because it can vary by geography and where the streams come in. But all in all, our outlook is very strong at \u2013 from a core price perspective, I really think that, that tells the story. And we\u2019re driving core price above 4% in the landfill line of business, which is the result we want to see.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you. And Devina, you also mentioned something about incentive comp being higher in the future. I wasn\u2019t sure if that was a comment regarding the second quarter \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, the second half of 2021 or if that was 2022 or both. Could you clarify?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So it really is a difference between whether you\u2019re looking at EBITDA or free cash flow. So I\u2019ll start with EBITDA. It\u2019s something that\u2019s impacted us in the first half of the year, the total impact for the full year, we now expect to be in the ballpark of around $60 million, could be a little north of that from an EBITDA cost perspective. And so you are seeing some margin pressure from that. When we look at the collection and disposal business, in particular, when we disclosed in the press release that, that business was backwards 10 basis points relative to prior year, 50 basis points of that was actually incentive compensation. So when you adjust for that, that shows that the traditional solid waste business actually made really strong progress in margin expansion. Our cash flow impact on a year-over-year basis will show up in 2022. And so that\u2019s where I made the 2022 comment earlier because this year in 2021, when we paid last year\u2019s bonus, we had a little bit of a benefit to cash flow relative to what we would expect in the year ahead just because 2020\u2019s payout was around 70% for the total company, and we expect this year to be meaningfully higher than that.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Very good, thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: And our last question will come from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nMichael Feniger: Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Great quarter. Just a question just for Devina, I mean, you guys raised the outlook, which is great. Just to check my math, is the margin range still the same with the April guide? And in the first half, you guys expanded margin of 80 basis points, 50 bps in Q2, which is impressive with the volume recovery. So I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what you\u2019re implying in the second half. And is that what you were referring to earlier in the call, Devina, when you said you feel like there is some conservatism still in this guide?\nDevina Rankin: It\u2019s a great question, Michael. And what I would say is the implied guide on margin is that we\u2019re basically flat to positive 50 basis points for the full year. And what that implies about the second half is that we will have a chance for a little bit of margin degradation from the year prior. The what behind that really comes down to the inflationary cost pressures that we\u2019ve talked a great deal about, incentive compensation but also the conversation about the strength in hiring. We\u2019re going to have additional training hours in the back half of the year as we get those new drivers on board. All of those things put slight downward pressure on the margin outlook. But there are a lot of positives and we\u2019re focused on those positives and think that they could outperform what we\u2019re currently projecting, though too early to say. The first is definitely the strength of the traditional solid waste business. And we always have to lead with that. Certainly, recycling commodity price and RIN values provide additional benefit from a margin perspective. Then the ADS integration, the strength of that in the back half of the year and John\u2019s comments earlier about where we are year-to-date on synergies but where we expect to end the year. The ADS business, we estimate, could have provided as much as a 75 basis point headwind to our margins in the second quarter. And we expect that, that moderates in the back half of the year as we do things like moderate the level of incremental investment that\u2019s needed in the fleet to get it to WM standards, and we realize that synergy potential that we\u2019ve outlined for everyone. So as much as there are some things that are working against us, we do think that there are some tailwinds. Just a little difficult for us to predict, particularly given the inflationary cost environment that we\u2019re all talking about.\nMichael Feniger: Understandable, Devina. That makes sense. And with that slight margin degradation that you\u2019re kind of expecting in the second half, that you laid out some of the positives, I mean, I guess, to Devina or Jim, I mean, this is a weird year obviously with comps from COVID. When all this gets normalized, when we think about 2022, just to set the stage here, are we thinking like 2% plus volumes with this economic recovery, yields shifting higher because of pricing? Is it in the 3% range? And what you\u2019re seeing on the pricing front, and Devina, like what you suggested with some of these moderating investments, I mean, are we thinking about margin expansion above 50% in 2022 with what you guys are seeing right now and the yield you guys are expecting in the second half of this year as some of these costs that kind of fade out next year? Maybe just help set that stage if 50 bps of margin expansion kind of makes sense next year.\nJim Fish: So Michael, we\u2019re really just kind of entering into our 2022 budgeting process here, so I would say we don\u2019t have a lot of detail on it yet. But on kind of a bigger scale here, I do think we\u2019re feeling encouraged about the volume and the price forecast as we think about 2022 and even beyond 2022. Pricing, in particular, feels like we\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re able to not only cover inflationary cost increases but also add to margin. And we\u2019re very encouraged by the sequential signs we\u2019ve seen both in collection and landfill pricing. So that gives us quite a bit of confidence on the price front. Volumes, the volumes have been good. And to your point, 2020 comparisons were not meaningful. But look, volume hasn\u2019t totally returned. I talked about Canada being soft. And we think Canada obviously will come back when we get to 2022, so that would be a tailwind for us on the volume side. Landfill volumes have not fully returned. MSW is the one that may be the exception there, but I mentioned special waste and C&D that have not fully returned. Those appear, though, to be very strong right now, and the pipeline appears very good with special waste. So we will obviously give you more color as we get to our guidance session, but we feel encouraged about what we\u2019re doing on OpEx, what we\u2019re seeing on volume and price, and we feel encouraged about the longer term trends for recycling. All of that would bode well for the \u2013 at the out years.\nMichael Feniger: Thanks guys. Thanks, Jim.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Alright, thank you. A bit of a long call today but we\u2019re particularly proud of the results for the quarter, so we want to make sure we took all your questions. Thank you for your questions. Very good questions today and thanks for your time.

            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us. Last quarter, we were feeling very good about the prospects for the year when we announced our Q1 results and raised our full year guidance. Now more than halfway through the year, all parts of our business have performed well above those revised expectations. In the second quarter, we achieved operating EBITDA of $1.31 billion, which we converted into strong cash from operations of more than $1 billion. First and foremost, this superb performance is a result of our outstanding core business model. In addition, this performance was driven by our continued focus on providing our customers with exceptional service, offering our employees a great place to work and driving sustainability through our business model. Our very strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we are making to our business model, led us to increase our full year guidance once again. The size of our revisions in each of these first two quarters clearly demonstrates the earnings producing potential of our strategy. In the back half of the year, we expect continued strong volume, pricing that offsets inflationary pressures and record results from our commodity-based businesses. With all of this powerful momentum, we now expect to generate 2021 adjusted operating EBITDA of at least $5 billion with free cash flow of at least $2.5 billion, all while continuing to make growth investments in our sustainable solutions and technology platforms. At the core of these strong results is our recycling business, which is central to our sustainability and business strategy. Our efforts to improve the recycling business, combined with robust demand for recycled commodities, led to second quarter delivering the recycling business' best ever financial performance by a considerable margin. We have made substantial progress in de-risking our recycling business by shifting to a fee-for-service contract structure, which has lifted the floor for recycled returns and created an economically sustainable business model. We have also made significant technology investments to improve the cost structure and grow the business. At our automated facilities, labor costs were 35% lower in the second quarter compared to our other single-stream MRFs. These investments not only lower operating costs and improve plant efficiency, but also allow us to adjust our equipment to respond to evolving end-market demands. For example, we are now segregating out specific plastics that in the past were sold as a bundled lower-priced bale, reacting quickly as markets evolve for new recycled commodity types. The capability to efficiently sort these materials allows us to extract more value for these commodities as demand increases for recycled material. Overall, our investment in recycling technology \u2013 our investments in recycling technology are generating solid returns and we are accelerating our plans to roll out this new operating model across our MRF network. Sustainability has been a central part of our strategy for many years. So I want to take some time to highlight how we are advancing our sustainability journey. At the beginning of the month, Tara Hemmer transitioned into her new role as Senior Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer, bringing together our sustainable solutions and ESG efforts under one umbrella. We believe this strong focus is critical to continuing to integrate environmental sustainability and social responsibility into a strategic business framework. Our supply chain goals, which include increasing our spending, both with sustainable and diverse suppliers, are examples of how this focus is integrated in our day-to-day operations. Next month, we are hosting a supplier diversity initiative called Share the Green, which will give women-owned businesses the opportunity to become a supplier for one or more of the 45 companies participating in the event. This 3-day nationwide event will provide great opportunities for diverse businesses and help participating companies to secure excellent suppliers. And finally, we continue to make real progress on our digital transformation to differentiate our customers' experience. In the past, I have mentioned our automated setup process that streamlines customers' orders and reduces our cost to serve. Through our advanced technology, we are eliminating nearly all manual steps in setting up a customer count, allowing setup to occur almost instantaneously after an order is processed. This will save us several million dollars annually, improve setup accuracy and increase customer satisfaction. This more accurate setup of customers also helps us to auto-route these customers, which increases operational efficiency and will optimize routes without manual processing. We are now connecting our advanced technologies to automatically insert 90% of our new commercial customers into existing routes, reducing our cost to serve and improving our speed to service. Our customer and digital teams continue to enhance the capabilities of our digital tools to provide a unique and engaging experience for our customers, while at the same time, connecting this front-end experience to our operational systems to allow for improved efficiency and lower costs. We expect that these investments in technology will continue to benefit us for many years to come. In conclusion, strong performance across all of our businesses, collection and disposal, recycling and renewable energy generated outstanding results so far this year. Our focus on disciplined pricing and cost management helped to offset the inflationary cost pressures that we have seen. And we expect to continue this focus into the second half of the year to help us deliver on our newly revised outlook. I will now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Good morning, Tyler. We are seeing it easing at this point, because we are hiring. And as Devina went through the numbers and John as well, we have had to hire at a higher rate. I think Devina mentioned $125 million as kind of a combination of incentive compensation and higher costs. And so those higher costs, in large part, are due to some of these inflationary pressures that we are seeing on the labor line. And so if I use June as an example, I think the number is \u2013 we hired 685 mostly drivers and technicians in the month of June. And it wasn't just churning people, because we had 125 who left. So, the net addition was pretty significant to replace some of these folks that have decided to sit on the sidelines, because of the government programs that are out there. I would tell you those government programs are affecting not just us they are affecting big and small businesses. And right now, at least in the United States, the federal benefits are scheduled to roll off on the 6th of September. It's not a stretch to say that there isn't a business out there that isn't looking forward to the 6th of September. To your first question about whether it is precluding growth or just creating some difficulties on it with existing customers, I think it's much more of the latter. I don't see it keeping us from growing and that's reflected mostly in our volume figures. Tyler, real quick one kind of indication as we think about recycled commodity prices is that we do believe we are on a longer term bullish trend here and there is a couple of reasons for that. One is we think there is a permanent shift that's taking place, particularly as you think about OCC, but also plastics. Just to give you one other data point here, when we think about OCC pricing and how much room it has to go, we are 17% above historical averages at the end of the second quarter, but we are still 40% below all-time highs. So, we think there still is room to go. And as we and other companies are kind of moving forward, this ESG movement is really gaining traction. We think that commodities like plastics will continue to increase in price. So, we are encouraged by the pricing trends and we don't think they are the same kind of ebbs and flows that were short-lived in the past. We think these are longer term. Good morning. I think we have done a good job over the last couple of years since the last peak of really de-risking the recycling business overall, so that when we do have these kind of high highs or low lows, we tend to smooth those out. And then really, it's more smoothing out the low lows than smoothing out the high highs. We would like to take advantage of these very high prices when they get there, but not taking on the chin when we have the very low prices and so some of that de-risking is moving to a fee-based model. Some of it has \u2013 and that has really proven to be successful for us. Some of it is the new technology that John and I mentioned, putting that into our network so that we operate those at a lower-cost structure. I mentioned 35% difference between the kind of the next-gen plants versus current plants. And Devina mentioned an acceleration of CapEx there pulling that forward. So, that's a way that I think we mitigate some of this. And then I do believe that it probably was \u2013 while it didn't feel like that at the time, it was probably a good thing that we ultimately lost our biggest customer in recycling, which was China a couple of years ago because now it's all moved \u2013 a lot of that's moved back to state side and is more predictable. And so I think the recycling business has changed a lot from when we had our last peak, which was, as you said, 2017 and it's changed for the better and I think it's changed permanently. Thanks Michael. Sure, Jeff. Really, the only kind of persistent slowness that we are seeing right now is in Canada. And I looked at July's numbers again this morning and that's still there. The encouraging part about Canada is it looks like it's going to reopen fully sometime in the next two weeks to three weeks, so that is encouraging for us. But it hasn't been great, and it has been kind of three months to six months behind the United States. So, July's numbers still look soft in Canada. That's really the biggest geographic difference for us. I think when you \u2013 John mentioned that commercial has fully recovered when you really compare to 2019 \u2013 2020 comparisons, for obvious reasons, are not really meaningful. But when you start comparing to 2019, commercial has fully recovered. But it's only about 0.5% above 2019. We really haven't seen kind of the growth aspect of the economy hit that commercial line of business. And then maybe most encouraging of all for us individually and then also on a more macro basis for the overall economy, are our C&D and special waste streams. And when we look sequentially at how they did, I mean, those two waste streams took the biggest hit of anything last year during COVID. And so they have seen the biggest sequential improvement, so they are on a great upward track. And I think those two by themselves, which tend to be kind of the most forward-looking indicators for us, are the best barometer overall of not only our business going forward, but maybe even the North American economies, a good macro sign for the comp. Yes. So, let me \u2013 I am going to let John chime in on the resi piece real quick. I will just give you a little bit of my kind of overview on pricing. First of all, we were \u2013 when we looked at our pricing numbers, again, another metric that's not overly meaningful year-over-year, because as you recall, last year, we really put the brakes on with respect to some of our pricing actions. But when you look sequentially at what we did in terms of collection price and in terms of landfill price, that's what gives us \u2013 that's what makes us feel most encouraged about the potential going forward. And to Devina's points, that is an area of confidence for us. The team understands that pricing is critical to cost recovery, but that it's also critical to margin expansion. So, we are not just looking at this as a cost recovery mechanism. Part of the success for the quarter was that we did use pricing to recover some of those cost pressures that we have discussed. But it also helped us expand margins. And that really is the plan going into 2022, that we will continue to use price to offset what we expect will be some continued inflation, not as aggressive of inflation figures we are seeing now because some of this, we believe, is temporary, as I mentioned earlier, caused by some of the current government's benefits. But there is some \u2013 feels like some structural inflation in the system. Pricing will help us more than recover that and will be a good thing for us going forward. And John, maybe you can talk about resi pricing a bit. Well, Hamzah, I have also said a number of times that we are looking at this somewhat opportunistically. If the high of kind of available folks who would work for this company is shrinking. And look, I have heard that from my 18-year-old daughter that people aren't interested in her high school \u2013 senior high school class in driving trucks. Then that actually is okay for us as long as we get ours. And that's what I have said is, if we get ours and the pie is shrinking, I don't care about the rest of the pie. All I care about is ours. And so there is kind of an opportunistic approach to this. But to John's point, I mean, I think we are getting ours. It hasn't been a completely smooth road for us, to be honest. But I think we are getting to a point. And certainly, September 6 will be helpful for everyone when these benefits roll off. Sure. So by the way, to your point about our balance sheet, I mean, it's a compliment to Devina and John and the whole team for really getting our balance sheet back down to where we said it would be by the end of the year, and that's \u2013 it's pretty impressive that through this acquisition, we are already down below 3x against down, I think, 2.85x. So regarding M&A, Hamzah, outside of core, the \u2013 and you mentioned specifically plastics, I think you are aware of the ownership position we have in the company called Continuous Materials, and that company does turn plastics and paper \u2013 low-value plastics and mixed papers into a roofing material. And we have a 33% ish investments in them at this point. So, that \u2013 we are excited about the potential for that. And it helps us take some of that material that might otherwise find its way to a landfill, pull it out of the landfill because it doesn't do anything in terms of creating any gas or anything usable coming out of the landfill and doing something that's preferable in terms of kind of ESG, but also preferable financially for us. So, we will look for those types of investments. We are cautious about big acquisitions regardless, but particularly cautious about big non-core acquisitions. I just don't want to step on a landmine here as we are walking down a pretty nice path and that could be a landmine if we were to do something like that. So, we are not opposed to doing non-core acquisitions. We want to make sure that we have a lot of intelligence in those before we do anything. And I would be surprised, very surprised if you would see us do anything large in the non-core space. Thank you. Well, no, I think you've hit on kind of the key macroeconomic piece here, which is that finally, it looks like demand is catching up with supply. We've always had the supply, but we haven't, until fairly recently, had as much demand as we would like. We've had demand but maybe not as much as we would like. And I think what we're seeing is that companies are now, with this real focus on virtually every company, ESG focus, are inclined to use recycled material, recycled \u2013 improve the recycled content percentages. So that's been a benefit for us. There is still, to your point, there still is opportunity, I think, to expand infrastructure, particularly here in the U.S., but we are seeing it \u2013 we're seeing encouraging signs there. And we have outlets through our brokerage group outside of the United States, which has been one of the real benefits there. When China went away literally overnight, our brokerage team was able to move commodities pretty quickly to other spots, other places around the world. And we still have those and we will continue to move commodities there. But I do like the long-term trends not only for our recycling business but as someone who's is very focused on the environment. I like the fact that we're moving to becoming more ESG-focused and that we're \u2013 the companies that are using and producing materials are looking to use recycled content as opposed to just using virgin content. Thank you. I don't know that we know exactly what the time line is. We saw that as well. Maybe a bit more of a kind of a macro answer to that is that we do look at PFAS as being a cost impact to us, but we look at it as a much bigger opportunity for us than a cost impact. We know there may be some added costs, albeit something we have had our eye on for quite some time and have been honestly working with EPA on it for quite some time. But we also really are looking at this with a pretty interested eye because once we do know those details that you referenced there, I think it really opens up a big opportunity for us. And so we're \u2013 I'm not sure it might be overstating to say we're excited about it, but we do \u2013 we are encouraged that this could be a big stream, revenue stream for us. But at this point, it still is \u2013 I'll use John's words, it still is a little bit murky. And we don't know exactly what the details are going to be on how they \u2013 what they say about PFAS. But for example, we're \u2013 it feels a little bit like it's coal combustion residual part two. So Michael, we're really just kind of entering into our 2022 budgeting process here, so I would say we don't have a lot of detail on it yet. But on kind of a bigger scale here, I do think we're feeling encouraged about the volume and the price forecast as we think about 2022 and even beyond 2022. Pricing, in particular, feels like we're encouraged that we're able to not only cover inflationary cost increases but also add to margin. And we're very encouraged by the sequential signs we've seen both in collection and landfill pricing. So that gives us quite a bit of confidence on the price front. Volumes, the volumes have been good. And to your point, 2020 comparisons were not meaningful. But look, volume hasn't totally returned. I talked about Canada being soft. And we think Canada obviously will come back when we get to 2022, so that would be a tailwind for us on the volume side. Landfill volumes have not fully returned. MSW is the one that may be the exception there, but I mentioned special waste and C&D that have not fully returned. Those appear, though, to be very strong right now, and the pipeline appears very good with special waste. So we will obviously give you more color as we get to our guidance session, but we feel encouraged about what we're doing on OpEx, what we're seeing on volume and price, and we feel encouraged about the longer term trends for recycling. All of that would bode well for the \u2013 at the out years. Thanks, Michael. Alright, thank you. A bit of a long call today but we're particularly proud of the results for the quarter, so we want to make sure we took all your questions. Thank you for your questions. Very good questions today and thanks for your time. I look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning. Our team once again delivered strong performance in the second quarter. Robust volume growth since last year's peak pandemic impact, dynamic pricing efforts, record recycling results, disciplined integration of the ADS business, and our continued focus on cost management combined to deliver 28% operating EBITDA growth and 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion. As Jim mentioned, these outstanding results and our confidence in the continued strength of our business model have led us to raise our 2021 financial guidance yet again. Full year revenue growth is now expected to be 15.5% to 16%, with organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 5.5% or greater. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we expect to generate between $5 billion and $5.1 billion, an increase of $225 million at the midpoint from the original guidance we provided in February. Our business is exceeding the strong outlook we established at the beginning of the year on a number of fronts. Volume has recovered, particularly in the commercial collection business at a faster rate than we expected. Market values for recycled commodities and RINs have increased. Our integration of the ADS business has generated more synergy value. And certain of our technology investments focused on reducing our cost to serve have delivered more savings than planned. While the bridge from our initial guidance to the current guidance has a number of puts and takes, the most significant drivers are at accelerated price and volume recoveries in the collection and disposal business of about $135 million; improved recycling profitability of another $135 million; renewable energy increases of about $55 million; and additional ADS synergies of around $25 million. These increases are partially offset by elevated cost inflation and incentive compensation costs that we currently estimate to be about $125 million. The increase in adjusted operating EBITDA guidance is expected to translate directly into incremental free cash flow and we now expect that we will generate between $2.5 billion and $2.6 billion of free cash flow for the year. Turning to our second quarter results, SG&A was 9.6% of revenue in the second quarter, a 30 basis point improvement over 2020. This result demonstrates our success-making incremental technology investments that will benefit our customer engagement and cost to serve over the long-term. At the same time, we are realizing benefits from the integration of ADS and returns on certain of our new technology solutions. We also continue to focus on managing our discretionary spending to optimize our costs. Second quarter net cash provided by operating activities grew more than 20%. This increase was driven by our extremely strong operating EBITDA growth. There was an unfavorable working capital comparison in the second quarter, but we attribute that to timing differences in tax payments and cash received from CNG credits. We are encouraged to see continued progress on our DSO and DPO measures. In the second quarter, capital spending was $396 million, bringing capital expenditures in the first half of 2021 to just over $665 million. While capital spending in the first half of the year was expected to be less than prior year due to timing differences in truck delivery schedules, our 2021 pace of capital expenditures has been slower than we planned. The slower pace is due to supply chain and labor constraints impacting some of our vendors and we have made deliberate decisions to defer spending in some categories as we observe what we expect to be temporary dislocation in certain markets. To offset these delays, we are proactively pulling forward capital investments in areas we can and also where we know the returns will be strong. As Jim mentioned, we are in the process of accelerating recycling investments as we have strong proof points of technology and equipment upgrades, reducing the cost structure of the business and improving delivered quality of processed materials. We continue to target full year capital spending within our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range. In the first half of 2021, our business generated free cash flow of $1.5 billion, a conversion from operating EBITDA of 61%. This very strong result positions us well to achieve our new higher free cash flow outlook even as we target capital spending increases in the second half of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business, and strong and consistent shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we paid $242 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Our leverage ratio of 2.84x has improved even more quickly than expected due to our strong operating EBITDA growth and it's tracking well toward our target leverage of 2.75x by the end of the year. At the same time, our robust cash generation in the first half of the year positions us to increase our full year share repurchase expectation up to our full $1.35 billion authorization. With this increase, we expect our weighted average share count for the full year to be approximately 422 million shares. Thanks to the hard work of every member of the WM team. We delivered another quarter of strong operational and financial results. The successes of the first half of 2021 position WM to deliver on our commitments to our people, our customers, the communities we serve and our shareholders. With that, Holly, let's open the line for questions. Yes. So in the second quarter, it was just above $100 per ton on a mix basis. Our second half guide is a little over $117 a ton, bringing the full year outlook to an average of $104. July did see some really nice uptick from June levels. And for context purposes, June was at about $114 a ton. So, that gives you an indication that we are on the right track for our outlook for the remainder of the year. Yes. So, over the last few years, we had invested about $100 million annually in the recycling line of business and we had plans to continue at that pace. But as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are looking to accelerate that pace. And in the back half of the year, we are targeting somewhere upwards of $65 million or more in incremental capital spend in the recycling line of business relative to what our plans were because that is one of the places we see some opportunity to pull things forward both from a return profile and not an area where we've seen a significant impact from supply chain constraints. In the renewable energy business, I would say it's been a little more peaks and valleys with regard to our investment trend historically. But when we look forward, the pipeline for continued investment is very strong. We have one additional project that will complete in 2021, and we are already looking at somewhere around five or more for the years to come. We are still in the process of considering whether or not that's something that we do ourselves or that we look to do in partnership with others because this is a place where not only is there reason for us to consider preserving our capital for high-growth opportunities in the traditional collection and disposal business, but there is also tremendous interest in this type of investment in the space at sustainability and projects like this that are so unique in terms of opportunity can create incremental value. But your point about the returns on them is spot on, really good payback periods on both recycling and renewable energy. Yes. So, I think what's important here is that when we look at our pricing performance in the first half of 2021, it really did impress us to the upside on just about every line of business. John talked a great deal about the residential line of business and our intentional efforts there to improve profitability. But most importantly, I think you saw really strong pricing in industrial and commercial collection and then also the steps that we are taking to continue to drive price in the landfill line of business. Our outlook for second half because of the year-over-year comp is that we will have yield in the range of 2.75% to 3% in the back half of the year, and that's just representative of a more normalized pricing range that we had in the second half of 2020 relative to the second quarter of last year when we took those proactive steps that were really focused on customer retention and taking care of our customers in a desperate time of need, so really strong outlook for the second half. I would tell you that I am optimistic that there could be strength over and above even what our outlook presents currently. Thank you. Our current outlook says we can get there. I am less optimistic today than I was when we gave our guidance at the end of the first quarter, which is why we came off at the high end of the range that we had previously spoken to. I would tell you, there is no shortage of opportunity for us to invest in the business. And we are going after that opportunity in a very targeted way. And as I mentioned, the recycling line of business, in particular, is a place that we are accelerating. It's good for us to try and pull some of what we can forward so that we don't create too much of a headwind in 2022 for capital because there are things that we see pushing into that year that we would have expected to spend currently such as landfill airspace capacity where we have seen liner costs and availability be slower than what we would have expected. So I lost you there, Michael. Absolutely, and it's a great point. So, on the truck side in particular, it's all about making sure that we are positioned well for deliveries on a ready schedule. John will give a little more color on that, but we do have strong commitments both for the remainder of 2021 and early into 2022. So, I think the baseline conversation is one we really want to more fully discuss as we get later into the year. But we are really excited about the baseline that we have established. We are making progress on the working capital front, and we have certainly also made progress in terms of the investments that we are making in capital expenditures paying strong returns. The place I would give a little bit of caution with respect to that being the right number is the recycling and renewable energy business is providing a lift from a flow-through perspective. And you are not having to make an incremental capital investment to get that dollar. We did have a low bonus payment in 2021 as a result of the poor performance in 2020, and that will have an opposite impact in the year ahead. And then there is also some uncertainty in what corporate taxes look like in 2022. But I will tell you that the returns that we are seeing on our technology investments, the reduced interest run rate that we have established, given the recent debt transaction, having ADS fully integrated in the year ahead and just the general strong performance of the collection and disposal business, all of those things do provide upside. And so we are optimistic that we can maintain that 50%, but there is a little bit of caution that's prudent. Thanks Michael. Yes. We are at about 40%, Hamzah, and there is a mix there in terms of whether it's CPI flat or the Waste Sewer Trash index. We continue to prioritize a push towards WST, though I would tell you that we see strength in the CPI numbers and therefore view that as something that provides some incremental value, particularly in the second half of the year but then looking forward into 2022 as well. Sure, Sean. So, this is a new disclosure that we are making, and as the leading commentary on the table suggests, what we are attempting to do here is just provide clarity where there is a bit of inconsistency across the industry. And one of the things in particular that's really important in this business is conversation about operating EBITDA margin. And for WM in Q2 of 2021, on an apples-to-apples basis as best we can when we compare across the business, our operating EBITDA results were 31.2% for the quarter when you compare with this approach more similarly aligned with one of our competitors in particular. And all we are doing here, you can look at the operating expense table that's in the 10-Q and what you see there is the cost of goods sold line, and that includes rebates that we pay in the recycling line of business. That's the driver of that cost category. And what we are doing here is reflecting that if you were to net that against the associated revenues rather than grossing it up between revenue and operating expenses. The impact to our margin is 130 basis points in the quarter. The increase on a year-over-year basis reflects the strength of commodity prices, which we have talked about. And so naturally, with the continued strength and outlook for even better year-over-year comps in the second half of the year than we had in the first half of the year, you would expect that to expand further from the 130 basis points that we measured in the second quarter. But really, for us, this is about comparability and trying to enhance that across the space. So John really covered the substance and the business drivers very well. Walter, one kind of clarifying facts that I just want to be sure is clear for us is that the volume decline that you're seeing is different from container weight. And so the shift that we're seeing as people return to their workplaces and less people are working from home is more about the container weight, the volume measure that you're seeing in those intentional steps that we've taken that John has spoken about to be very prudent in terms of making incremental investments in the residential line of business with our capital and with our workforce where we are seeing constraints. And that's business that we knew that we would be shedding and shedding with purpose. Thank you, Walter. Thanks, Noah. Thank you. The landfill yield was slightly above our expectations in the second quarter, I would say not as much above expectations as, say, C&I was. And we do expect it to moderate somewhat from the second quarter levels, that we're still encouraged that with our focus on MSW pricing in particular and then the strong pipeline that we have from a volume perspective in C&D and special waste, that, that will give some natural lift to yields in the back half of the year as those streams tend to have strong pricing that's more difficult to predict specifically because it can vary by geography and where the streams come in. But all in all, our outlook is very strong at \u2013 from a core price perspective, I really think that, that tells the story. And we're driving core price above 4% in the landfill line of business, which is the result we want to see. Sure. So it really is a difference between whether you're looking at EBITDA or free cash flow. So I'll start with EBITDA. It's something that's impacted us in the first half of the year, the total impact for the full year, we now expect to be in the ballpark of around $60 million, could be a little north of that from an EBITDA cost perspective. And so you are seeing some margin pressure from that. When we look at the collection and disposal business, in particular, when we disclosed in the press release that, that business was backwards 10 basis points relative to prior year, 50 basis points of that was actually incentive compensation. So when you adjust for that, that shows that the traditional solid waste business actually made really strong progress in margin expansion. Our cash flow impact on a year-over-year basis will show up in 2022. And so that's where I made the 2022 comment earlier because this year in 2021, when we paid last year's bonus, we had a little bit of a benefit to cash flow relative to what we would expect in the year ahead just because 2020's payout was around 70% for the total company, and we expect this year to be meaningfully higher than that. Thank you. It's a great question, Michael. And what I would say is the implied guide on margin is that we're basically flat to positive 50 basis points for the full year. And what that implies about the second half is that we will have a chance for a little bit of margin degradation from the year prior. The what behind that really comes down to the inflationary cost pressures that we've talked a great deal about, incentive compensation but also the conversation about the strength in hiring. We're going to have additional training hours in the back half of the year as we get those new drivers on board. All of those things put slight downward pressure on the margin outlook. But there are a lot of positives and we're focused on those positives and think that they could outperform what we're currently projecting, though too early to say. The first is definitely the strength of the traditional solid waste business. And we always have to lead with that. Certainly, recycling commodity price and RIN values provide additional benefit from a margin perspective. Then the ADS integration, the strength of that in the back half of the year and John's comments earlier about where we are year-to-date on synergies but where we expect to end the year. The ADS business, we estimate, could have provided as much as a 75 basis point headwind to our margins in the second quarter. And we expect that, that moderates in the back half of the year as we do things like moderate the level of incremental investment that's needed in the fleet to get it to WM standards, and we realize that synergy potential that we've outlined for everyone. So as much as there are some things that are working against us, we do think that there are some tailwinds. Just a little difficult for us to predict, particularly given the inflationary cost environment that we're all talking about."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Good morning, everyone. We are pleased with the excellent second quarter results we achieved across our business. We produced exceptional EBITDA growth of almost 24% in the collection and disposal business as the economy continues to recover from the pandemic's steepest impacts in the second quarter of 2020. Collection and disposal volume climbed to 9.6% in the quarter, which exceeded our expectations. And our focus on disciplined pricing programs produced a substantive second quarter collection and disposal yield of 3.7%. Turning more specifically to our volume results, robust recovery in our highest margin businesses, commercial, industrial and landfill drove our very strong performance. In the second quarter, commercial and MSW volume reached pre-pandemic levels and industrial volumes recovered to levels just shy of those before the pandemic. While we are very pleased with the pace of volume recovery thus far, there remains opportunity for further volume improvement in the second half of the year from key areas of our business, including industrial, special waste and certain geographies such as Canada. Additionally, pockets of our commercial business, such as education and offices have yet to fully recover. For the full year, we now expect organic volume in the collection and disposal business to grow 2.5% or more. Pivoting to price, our second quarter results further demonstrate the focus the entire team has on overcoming our cost headwinds as well as improvements following the intentional customer-focused steps we took in the second quarter of 2020. This focus is particularly evident in our residential core price of 5.4%, landfill core price of 4.7% and transfer core price of 3.4%. We continue to be committed to pricing programs that are aligned with our cost structure, which is even more important as we see pressure on labor, transportation, supplies and capital costs. Our new full year outlook for collection and disposal yield is 3.0% or greater. Our strong revenue growth was also supported by great results in our customer metrics. Churn was 8.8% in the quarter and service increases outpaced service decreases by more than twofold. Additionally, we increased our net customer growth rate driven by optimization of our sales force and investments in technology. Looking at operating costs, second quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 10 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are continuing to manage our cost as volumes recover even in the face of inflationary cost pressures. It's no surprise to anyone who follows economic indicators that most businesses are experiencing inflation in their costs throughout 2021 and our business is no exception, particularly with regard to labor. We expect to overcome these pressures by increasing operating efficiencies and executing on our disciplined pricing programs. There is no silver bullet when it comes to attracting and retaining talent and we are using a multifaceted approach that includes addressing wages, offering flexible schedules and broadening benefits. Our long-term focus is on keeping our people first so that we are the employer of choice. Overall, inflation trends are something we are watching very closely and managing very proactively with our area, supply chain and revenue management teams. We continue to make progress on the integration of the advanced disposal operations. To-date, we have combined around 45% of the ADS operations into our billing and operational systems, which has allowed us to capture synergies and provide additional services to those customers. We are on track to migrate virtually all the ADS customers by the end of the year. Year-to-date, we have achieved more than $30 million of annual run-rate synergies and we expect cost synergies of between $80 million and $85 million in 2021. This will bring the annual run-rate synergies to around $100 million at the end of 2021 and we continue to forecast another $50 million to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of cost and capital savings. And finally, as Jim mentioned, our recycling team set new highs in the second quarter with record contributions to earnings and margins. We also achieved strong growth in our renewable energy business as we generated and sold more RINs and sold them at higher prices. We have made significant investments in these businesses in recent years and we are pleased with the strong returns they are generating. Before I turn the call over to Devina, I want to thank the entire WM team for the remarkable job they have done in managing our operations and providing safe and reliable service to our customers. Our people really are the foundation of our success. And with that, I will hand off to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Yes, Michael, I think where we are seeing some pressure is on the container side with steel prices. So, some \u2013 we are making some decisions on fixed versus buy there, but that would be normal. And to Devina's earlier point, we are seeing stress on the supply chain with some other commodity-based materials. We are pushing some, when I think about landfill liner and those kind of things, not going to affect the business, but whether we buy now or push off our decisions we are making with the supply chain team day in and day out. Yes, Jeff, and I think on resi, you heard that in some of our prepared comments, strong yield at 4.7 for the quarter, up from year-to-date. Same thing with core price. We did shed a little bit of volume, but I happen to know that, in fact, one big franchise we had in the Southeast which was underperforming and we made a decision to move it up and instead it went out. And I think what you are seeing though is continued and increasing benefit from our focus on moving the residential number and not to be \u2013 and part of that, you heard a lot of conversation about recycling. Part of fixing residential, I have said this on a few calls, is fixing recycling because about two-thirds of what we process comes from a residential stream that either we collect or another vendor collects. So, long story short, we feel good overall about our pricing strategy, the consistency and the upward trend. And specifically on residential, we expect to continue on a trend as well. Thank you. Good morning Hamzah. What I would tell you is that Jim pointed to June as being a particularly strong month. But really our progress on the hiring front really started four months or five months ago. As we started to get more confidence in what was coming back in terms of post-COVID recovery, we tried to get out in front of us. So, we have been making steady progress really for the last four months or five months. It really flipped in June and we really saw the fruits of our labor take hold. I would expect that going forward for the next handful of months we are going to continue at a similar pace. Keep in mind though, to the extent we talked about volume recovery and what lines of business is coming from, coupled with, as an example, in residential, where we may shed a little bit of volume going forward to get the right margins, we have to balance all those things out. But I think Jim's commentary around what we did in June is something you can expect from us for the next handful of months. Yes. I think Hamzah, whether CPI has been up or down, we have always \u2013 we have been demonstrating for the last more than a handful of years that regardless of what's going on with CPI, we are going to make sure we price the business to at least cover our costs and expand margin. Hi, good morning Sean. Yes, I would say the integration continues to go really well. You heard in my prepared remarks about our confidence around overall cost, SG&A synergies and reiterating that we still think when it's all said and done, we will have $150 million of total synergies by 2023. And you also heard from me that we are just about 45% of the way through taking that data from ADS' databases and moving that over to WM. So, that's allowing us to \u2013 when you think about routing efficiencies and the other logistical benefits from combining the customer base, you heard that as well in my prepared comments. And I think from a revenue standpoint, as we are moving that business in and it becomes WM business and it goes into portfolio and we are going to manage it in a similar fashion, we manage the rest of our business. Yes. I mean, look, to be honest, we haven't seen anything. I mean, we all read the news and we read comments and so you can kind of take those for whatever they are worth. But when we really look at some of the tuck-ins that we've done post-ADS, I mean, we haven't seen anything at this point. What we are hearing that's not related in really any way to your question but is more about M&A is that it's somewhat related, I guess, to the new administration because if there is a tax change, we are seeing that there are some companies out there that are becoming sellers because of this prospective change in tax law. Similarly, we're seeing some folks that are saying, what, I don't like the labor environment right now. And they are looking at selling for that reason. And then the third thing we're hearing is that in our industry, with some of these small businesses, there just isn't, in many cases, a robust succession plan for some of these companies. So I think it's not directly related to your question about DOJ, but it is related to some of the things that are happening within the current administration, whether it's subsidies for unemployed or whether it is related to tax law changes. But DOJ, we're not seeing anything at this point. Yes. Well, there are a few things. We are \u2013 we have seen a little bit of moderation as folks have returned back to their place of work. But there is going to be a little bit of a lingering effect because I think the workforce is going to change a little bit. You're going to see some more folks work remotely or from home. But that doesn't look meaningful. We have seen a little bit, Jim commented on this earlier, we have seen a little bit of a shift in the residential recycling stream. Obviously, Amazon is doing well. We're seeing it show up in the percentage of cardboard that's coming out or fiber is coming out of a lot of our residential contracts, which is honestly a good thing, especially in this environment. We are seeing some improvement, although not as significant by weight, if you will, in terms of the quality and quantity of some of the higher-margin streams. We talked specifically about plastics and the kind of mixed plastic we use to make versus the specific plastic products that we're producing for customers. So we view that all as positive. I think overall in general volume in terms of units I don't think our message has changed. We're going to continue to make sure that we move residential from a margin perspective up to where it competes with every other line of business. And we're really making good progress there. And if you look at our price versus volume in the last handful of quarters, it has been slightly negative. But if you look at the core price and yields compared to that, that's certainly a trade-off we are willing to make. As I've said before, we don't want to \u2013 we're not trying to push the volume out but we're going to make sure that the investments we're making in that line of business align with our overall long-term strategy from a profit and return standpoint. Yes. No, I think that's a great question. I think what you see in the numbers that we referenced around how we're \u2013 how pleased we are with the investments we made in this advanced and advancing technology, I think that supports the model. We are very pleased with the plants that we're \u2013 we've invested in thus far. Jim mentioned the labor arbitrage, that we're benefiting from that. And by the way, that's not just labor for labor's sake, those are positions that are certainly been and continue to be hard to fill so it's solving a few problems there. I think around the demand of the customer, we all mentioned that, that side of the equation is as strong now as it's ever been. And for all the comments made around ESG, we feel confident that, that's going to continue to grow. And I think plastics is one example. I mean, we've got the material stream either through our plants or through in other parts of the waste stream. And what you're seeing is some migration from what was in the waste stream obviously now to higher-value commodities. And Devina said this not today but on other calls, when you look at it from a return \u2013 a return on invested capital standpoint, our recycle plants are at the top of the heap. So to the extent we keep investing more CapEx there, we're going to be very pleased with that. And we think that the technology is advancing in a form and fashion that's going to allow us to continue to meet the customers' demands. Hey, Kevin. Good morning. No, good question. When we get often and what I said on the last call publicly in other venues is we are working with a number of vendors to watch to see how the battery technology is advancing. As I said before, I think naturally, we're going to \u2013 we were seeing it in the passenger vehicles and we will probably see in light-duty vehicles. In some cases, we're seeing it already. So we've got a number of vendors we're working with to watch the way the different technologies advance. I would tell you in terms of our strategy on fleet, we've said before, we've pivoted from the traditional diesel fleet that we had to CNG. I wouldn't say it was seamlessly but the way our fleet plan works is we have some flexibility to be able to move from diesel to CNG, and we view it as CNG to battery electric vehicles the same way. I would tell you what I think will happen is and I talked about this at the conference, Devina and I were at a few weeks ago at WasteExpo, I am confident that over time, they are going to solve the weight issue, the range issue, the [indiscernible] of a refuse vehicle, all those things, I think will get solved. I think the bigger question is the infrastructure piece. And we are also watching that to see what kind of infrastructure we would need in our distributed environment to be able to service a fleet of 20,000 vehicles. Kevin, I would \u2013 that's something I think is a little bit still a little murky at this point. That's the reason why we're working with a handful of different vendors just to make sure we've got our eye on all the different potential solutions to your good question. Yes, Jeff, our entire team is following what's going on with EPR. And I think our position is still the same, which is we feel like we have the assets, the infrastructure, the network to solve for a lot of the challenges that come out of EPR. So to the extent we can continue to maximize use of our assets, I think we're \u2013 we understand that. But that, too, is a little bit \u2013 there is still some wood to chop on that front as well. I know there is some things that are unique going up in Canada but I think we're well positioned there as well with \u2013 in terms of assets to help solve for that challenge. Thanks, Jeff."

Any comparisons, unless otherwise stated, will be with the first quarter of 2020. Net income, EPS, operating EBITDA margin and SG&A expense results have been adjusted to enhance comparability by excluding certain items that management believes do not reflect our fundamental business performance or results of operations. These adjusted measures, in addition to free cash flow are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the earnings press release and tables, which can be found on the Company\u2019s website at www.wm.com for reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures and additional information of our use of non-GAAP measures and non-GAAP projections.

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Waste Management\u2019s President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. It was said many times last year that 2020 was a year like no other. For many reasons, it was an incredibly difficult and trying year. Yet our positive message internally was the great companies use tough times to better themselves, and that\u2019s precisely what WM did. And first quarter of 2021 showed that with an exclamation point. We had an exceptionally strong start to the year as we kept our focus on those fundamentals that have always been is great. Our people first, then our customers, and then we focus on the details of our business. And that order inevitably produces the best results. In Q1, it sure did as we achieved record operating EBITDA of $1.16 billion and robust cash from operations of $1.12 billion. Typically, during our first quarter earnings call, we reaffirm our full year guidance. However, as we view these strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we\u2019re making to our business model and the fact that we have yet to see a full recovery in our critical landfill commercial and industrial volumes, it became clear that we\u2019re on track to outperform our guidance from only two months ago. Combine this with the broader economic trends and all indicators show that our full year revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow are on track to meet or exceed the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in February. Devina will discuss our updated guidance, but it\u2019s safe to say, we\u2019re very excited about our performance for the first quarter, and we expect to show continued strength throughout the year. We\u2019re seeing tangible benefits from the investments that we\u2019ve made in recycling and renewable energy. In our recycling line of business, we\u2019ve developed a model for all new plants which with the addition of sophisticated technology produces far better returns through a combination of added efficiencies, a higher quality of saleable material, and less residual material for disposal at the end of the process, all while our basket of recycled commodity prices have climbed back nicely to historical average price levels. Additionally, three years ago, we made the decision to close the loop between our natural gas fleet and the gas produced at our landfills by investing in the renewable energy business. We\u2019re now seeing those investments pay healthy dividends with approximately two to three-year paybacks on our four plants, in tandem with greater stability and higher pricing in the renewable energy markets. As we discussed last quarter, WM is also well-positioned to leverage our ESG leadership and particularly our focus on environmental sustainability to help our customers meet their own climate goals through recycling and other beneficial uses such as renewable energy generation. We\u2019re in a unique position to help key stakeholders rise to the challenge. And we can do this while growing our business at the same time, collaborating with our stakeholders to find new ways to create value together. Continuing to integrate environmental sustainability into our strategic business framework for long-term sustainable and profitable growth requires a strong focus, which is why we\u2019ve taken a step to dedicate a member of our senior team to this effort. I\u2019m pleased to announce that Tara Hemmer, Senior Vice President of Operations, will be taking this new role as Senior Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer reporting directly to me effective July 1. With Tara\u2019s move, our Area Vice President leading the Greater Mid-Atlantic area, Rafa Carrasco, will be promoted to a member of the senior leadership team as Senior Vice President of Operations. We\u2019ve also launched a new exciting education benefit for our team members this month that will provide development and upskilling opportunities for our workforce. These changes underscore how the tenants of ESG are embedded into our broader business strategy. As digital transformation sweeps across nearly every industry in the way of the pandemic, we\u2019re making strides in differentiating our customers\u2019 experience through end-to-end digital transformation. Today, our customers can manage their relationship with us through online -- through our online My WM platform, which is connected operationally through our Smart Truck technology and supported by our customer analytics and data management tools. Our newly automated setup process streamlines customer orders and accelerates the speed at which we can deliver on our commitments while also reducing our cost to serve. These developments, combined with continued growth of our e-commerce channel, give us confidence that our decision to accelerate technology investments was the right one, and we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, more agile company. In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team for their hard work and dedication that has positioned us for a record-setting 2021. WM is well-positioned to benefit from the continued reopening as more states and provinces emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our commercial, industrial and landfill businesses, our three most lines of business, to benefit from further volume recovery and produce robust financial results with high incremental margins over the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before reviewing the terrific operating results that we achieved in the first quarter, I want to provide an update on the integration of ADS. Over the last six months, we\u2019ve made significant progress on combining the two businesses, and we\u2019ve been able to accelerate some of our integration plans. The teams have worked tirelessly to make sure that this combination goes smoothly. And based on the success of the integration so far, we are increasing our synergy expectations to $150 million of total annual run rate synergies, $130 million coming from operating costs and SG&A savings and $20 million coming from capital savings. For 2021, we now expect synergies of between $75 million and $85 million, all coming from cost savings. With approximately $15 million of annualized synergies captured in 2020, we expect to exit 2021 on an annual run rate synergy level of around $100 million. The remaining $50 million is expected to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of operating costs, SG&A and capital expenditures. Now turning to our first quarter results. Organic revenue grew 2.1% as disciplined pricing and improved recycling results overcame modest volume declines. Pricing performance for the quarter was very solid with both, core price of 3.4%, and collection and disposal yield of 2.8%, outpacing our expectations. Notably, our commercial yield rebounded sequentially from 3.1% -- to 3.1% from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. As economic reopening progressed during the first quarter, collection and disposal volumes improved again sequentially to a decline of 2.3% from 2.7% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, net new business turned positive, churn improved meaningfully to 8.2% and service increases expanded. While volumes have recovered meaningfully from the second quarter of 2020, collection and disposal -- from the second quarter 2020 collection and disposal decline of 10.9%. As Jim pointed out, WM is positioned to benefit from further improvements in North American economies. For example, at the end of the first quarter, we have recovered about 72% of the commercial yards lost due to COVID, providing room for considerable improvement in commercial volumes as we progress through the year. Similarly, our other highest-margin businesses, industrial and landfill have volume upside opportunity as visibility into the economic reopening continues to improve and more event work is scheduled and completed. Looking at the lines of business, we\u2019re making improvements with the help of a very deliberate pricing focus, residential landfill and recycling, I\u2019m happy to report that we have had standout in each of these areas during the quarter. Residential yield doubled year-over-year to 4.2% as we make strides to improve the profitability in this line of business. This is the highest residential yield we have achieved since 2008 and it showcases our success in demonstrating the value of our service and pricing it appropriately. The increased yield drove operating EBITDA margins in the residential line of business to the highest level in the past 12 months despite still elevated residential container rates. Landfill core price was 3.2%, a strong result when you consider the impact of lower volumes related both to the pandemic and severe winter weather. In recycling, operating EBITDA doubled year-over-year to achieve earnings that rank in our top five best quarters ever. These results are truly a reflection of our work to improve the business model while creating a sustainable solution for our customers and not simply the result of an increase in recycled commodity prices. While our other top recycling quarters had an average commodity price of $127 per ton, we achieved our strong first quarter results with a price of $79 per ton. Finally, turning to costs. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are maintaining our cost discipline as volumes recover. In the first quarter, we saw a 40 basis-point improvement in our labor costs as we continue to manage overtime spending. We also saw efficiency improvements in both the commercial and industrial lines of business, which we were able to identify and capture as our investments in technology help make us nimbler. In closing, I want to thank the waste management team for the exceptional job they have done in managing our operations to position us for success in 2021. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As you\u2019ve heard from both Jim and John, we had a fantastic start to 2021 and we forecast continued strength our business as local economies emerge from the pandemic. These strong results and our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year have led us to raise our full year financial guidance. Revenue growth is expected to be 12.5% to 13% with combined internal revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of 4.5% or greater. The increased outlook is underpinned by our disciplined pricing programs and strong outlook for continued volume recovery. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we now expect to generate between $4.875 billion and $4.975 billion, a $100 million increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance. The improved outlook for adjusted operating EBITDA translates directly into incremental free cash flow. And we now expect that we will generate between $2.325 billion and $2.425 billion of free cash flow for the year. Our team members on the front line continue to deliver and the investments we are making in our people, technology and customer experience are generating strong results. Turning to our first quarter results. Net cash provided by operating activities grew $355 million. The contribution from operating EBITDA growth accounted for a little less than half of that increase, with the remainder coming from lower incentive compensation payments and increasing cash collections from customers, and favorable timing of some of our payables. While we expect some of the timing differences experienced in the first quarter to reverse for the year, the remaining contributors to our strong cash flow from operations results position us for a very strong year. In the first quarter, capital spending was $270 million, a $189 million decrease from the first quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter, primarily due to timing, plus the timing of fleet purchases, which we had intentionally front-loaded in 2020 and steps we took in late 2020 to accelerate some of our 2021 capital, given our confidence in the pace of volume recovery. We continue to prioritize the investments in the long-term growth of our business, including recycling, renewable energy and technology investments that we have previously discussed. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range as we invest in our business to support growth, reduce our cost to serve and extend our environmental sustainability efforts. Putting it all together, our business generated free cash flow of $865 million in the first quarter. The operating EBITDA growth, lower capital expenditures and favorable working capital changes that I discussed drove the significant year-over-year free cash flow increase. This sets us up very well to achieve our increased free cash flow outlook. In the first quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $247 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Turning to SG&A costs. SG&A was 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter. That\u2019s a 20 basis-point increase over 2020. We remain focused on managing our discretionary costs, optimizing our structure for the ADS acquisition and using SG&A dollars to enhance our business. Our deliberate increased level of investment in technology as well as higher incentive compensation accruals are the driver of SG&A as a percentage of revenue being above our long-term target of less than 10% of revenue. Though we are committed to ensuring we return to that optimized cost structure in the near term. Our first quarter leverage ratio of 3.04 times has improved from the fourth quarter due to our strong operating EBITDA growth. This leverage ratio remains well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facility and right at the top of our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times. Our strong first quarter results and increased expectations for current year operating EBITDA and free cash flow, position us to purchase at least $1 billion of our shares in 2021, and at the same time, achieve our target leverage of 2.75 times by the end of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business, and strong and consistent shareholder returns. With the strength of our collection and disposal business, expectations for continued recovery and improved market backdrop for recycling, effective cost control and even better-than-expected integration synergies from the ADS acquisition, cash flow converges conversion is strong. And as a result, we expect to increase cash allocated to shareholder returns from our initial plans. In closing, it is imperative that we thank the men and women across the Waste Management team for their tireless efforts to serve our customers and communities each day. Our strong results are a testament to their commitment, and we\u2019re excited about what we will achieve together over the remainder of the year. With that, Holly, let\u2019s open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from the line of Jerry Revich, Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nDevina Rankin: Holly?\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Can you hear me?\nOperator: Yes. We can hear you.\nJerry Revich: Okay, great. Good morning, everyone. Really nice performance out of the gate here. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about, as you look at your employee footprint today and look forward to recovery, what level of volume growth can the business absorb before we\u2019re back to adding headcount? [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about what\u2019s the magnitude of volume growth that your footprint can absorb off of the current run rate levels before we\u2019re back at having to add headcount. You spoke about reducing overtime in the quarter. And as we shift forward to recovery from here, I\u2019m wondering if you could touch on how we should think about absorption from here in capacity. Thanks.\nJim Fish: Yes, Jerry. What I would tell you is if you looked at our performance throughout the kind of COVID, the volume slide, if you will, efficiencies improved throughout, obviously, as I mentioned, our management of over time certainly improved. And what that also did is helped us build some capacity in the system. So, as we look at the rest of 2020, what we\u2019ve revised guidance to, we feel like we\u2019re in good shape to absorb that volume.\nJohn Morris: Jerry, I would add one thing here, too, which is about adding back labor. I mean, there\u2019s a couple of dynamics here. One is that pretty much all U.S. companies are facing, large or small, is this temporary competition against the government for unemployment benefits, and that is having an impact on us. The good news for us is that we didn\u2019t lay people off from COVID. So, if you did, and you\u2019re trying to rehire right now, you\u2019re having a tough time. And we -- as you may recall, we guaranteed 40 hours last year when we first hit and said, you\u2019re not going to lose your job because of COVID. So, that did help us. Not sure that we expected this unemployment benefit to continue as it has, but it did help us. I think, the other aspect of this is that we recognize that labor inflation is going to be around. It\u2019s been 5%ish for our nonexempt for a couple of years now. But we didn\u2019t anticipate this new competitor being the government. We think that\u2019s temporary. Right now, I think it\u2019s scheduled to -- these unemployment benefits are schedules go at the end of July. They may get extended with the new package through September. But, we\u2019ll use pricing from a kind of a macroeconomic standpoint to make sure that we manage volume. We don\u2019t need to take all new volume coming. We\u2019ll take the best of the new volume, and we\u2019ll manage accordingly, John and his team will through the labor line by using price to maybe tamp down some of that volume if we need to.\nJerry Revich: Okay, terrific. I appreciate the color. And then, as we think about where volumes are tracking for the first quarter, they\u2019re about 3% below 2019 level. So, if that same trajectory holds in the second quarter, we should be looking at something like high-single-digit volume growth. Is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing through April? Can you just comment on whether that two-year stack holds and if that\u2019s what we should be thinking about the cadence in the second quarter?\nJim Fish: Yes. Jerry, I think you make great. We\u2019ve looked at 2019, we\u2019ve looked at 2020, and really, what we\u2019ve done is looked at Q4 of 2020 to look at some of the sequential trends on volume. And that\u2019s really where I think we see what we hear a level of confidence is. January, February were certainly challenging months, partly due to weather, partly due to just the comp year-over-year. Really happy with what we saw in March on the volume front and equally pleased with what we\u2019re seeing in April. So, while we\u2019ve looked at 2020, 2019, we\u2019ve really focused on what the sequential improvement has been, and that\u2019s part of why you heard the message from us about how we feel about the balance of the year.\nJerry Revich: Terrific. And lastly, on the ESG side, obviously, some clarity for wind pricing now. Can you talk about to what extent you have the capability based on permitting to transition additional landfills to landfill gas producing landfills that tie to the grid to take advantage of where wind prices are and what the cadence of the additions could look like over the next couple of years?\nJim Fish: Yes. So, we have -- as I mentioned, we have four plants. Now, we have a fifth that would be coming on line in 2022. That capital is being spent right now. That\u2019s in the plan. So, that Devina mentioned. This is -- we believe it\u2019s a nice opportunity for us, and it\u2019s made possible because of the fact that our fleets now -- we are -- almost at 70% of our routed fleet is CNG. And considering that that includes the ADS trucks, which are at a much lower percentage, we think there\u2019s a couple of benefits there. One is, just the simple shift from diesel to natural gas is definitely a good shift for us. And then, as you mentioned, the fact that we\u2019re able to close that loop between those natural gas trucks and the gas produced at our landfills, we like the investment. We started making this investment two or three years ago. They have -- at current pricing, they have really good returns. And I think you\u2019ll see us continue to do that as we\u2019re doing this year, and I expect we\u2019ll continue to do it next year.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Jeff Goldstein from Morgan Stanley.\nJeff Goldstein: On the new internal revenue growth guidance of 4.5% or greater, can you just help parse out what the breakdown of this figure is between yield and volume? How that compares at all to your prior thinking around the recovery in terms of that mix?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So, what we\u2019re looking at is what you saw in the first really strong performance on the yield side, translating into strength for the remainder of the year, and that really being the catalyst for the upside on the total of 4.5% or greater That being said, our initial outlook for volume was around 1.5% to 2%, and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll also be at the high end of that range. But outperformance to previous expectations at this point really is centered around strength in pricing and the outlook for continued strength over the rest of the year.\nJeff Goldstein: Okay, perfect. And just on the EBITDA margin guide for the year, if my math is right, the implied margin for the year is coming up a similar amount as the increase in the expected synergies from ADS. So, is that fair? And should we assume that based on that your other investment assumptions for the year are largely intact, or just any other cadence of expenses we should be contemplating for the year?\nJim Fish: Yes. When we look at 2021 on a year-over-year basis, we knew we had some cost headwinds. And in particular, the second quarter had some cost headwinds for health and welfare specifically. We also expected incentive compensation to be a headwind for the full year, though that\u2019s even greater headwind now because of our strong outlook for 2021 than we would have initially expected. Our overall margin guidance for 2021 initially was as much as a 50 basis-point improvement. You can see with the strong performance in the first quarter. We expect there could be some upside to that, though rather than update margins specifically at this point, we\u2019d really like to see the seasonal results on volume because the contribution margin from that incremental volume is one of the important things for us to keep our eye on. That being said, I think it\u2019s really important to step back and recognize that we started with guidance that could have been slightly backward at 20 basis points on a year-over-year comparison, both because of those comp headwinds and the integration of ADS. But then, when we look at where we stand today, we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll actually be at the high end of our expectations of 50 basis points. And that\u2019s certainly somewhat because of the ADS synergy capture, but it\u2019s also because of some stronger outlook on pricing that I mentioned earlier.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Hamzah Mazari with Jefferies.\nMario Cortellacci: Mario Cortellacci filling in for Hamzah. Maybe you could talk about how much room you have on the disposal pricing side. I think, it\u2019s running in the high-2 range right now as volumes are recovering. Maybe you can speak about it just in context of what you guys were executing on and what the goal was prior to COVID-19 and how pricing on the disposal side had started ramping prior to the pandemic.\nJim Fish: Yes. So, landfill pricing, as you know, is always a top priority for us. MSW core price was strong for the quarter as were the other lines of business. I think, an important distinction here is that several of these lines of business, specifically commercial, also as we\u2019ve talked many times about recycling, have become somewhat fee-based. And so, as volume increases, you see fees increase, and those fees go to the price line. So, it\u2019s honestly part of why -- there\u2019s a number of reasons why we took the unusual step to raise guidance in Q1. But, one of those is the strength that we\u2019re seeing in pricing. And of course, a second one is that when you think about volumes, and I mentioned it in my remarks, that volumes really have not recovered fully, especially in those three high-margin lines of business, commercial, landfill and industrial. John mentioned that we\u2019re starting to see really good green shoots in March and continuing into April on the volume front. And then, lastly, on reasons why we felt really comfortable with our guidance changes was that recycling is, as John mentioned in his script, we\u2019re producing these great results recycling at average commodity prices. I mean $79 for that basket of commodities is right in the middle of our historical averages, whereas the other four quarters, we talked about the top five -- being in the top five best quarters of all time in recycling, and yet the other four when we were up at $125, $127 on an average commodity price, we\u2019re now down at 79%, at least that\u2019s where we were for the quarter. So, all of those combined to give us real confidence going forward that we could raise guidance. But pricing and landfill pricing in particular we think are a strength for the quarter and will continue to be in the next couple of quarters.\nMario Cortellacci: And then, on ASW synergies, just thinking about what the long-term revenue synergy potential is there. I mean, prior to the deal, they were busy doing deals in building out their route density and that more or less what was put on hold as the deal was going through. And then, again, we got hit by the pandemic. Does that create more pricing opportunity for that particular business on top of what, I guess, was already baked into what their plans were? And any thoughts on that would be great.\nJim Fish: Yes. We -- look, I think ADS will go through a similar price model that WM legacy goes through. So, what we\u2019ve really been focused on in terms of synergies is the cost synergies Obviously, with respect to ADS, just as with WM legacy, we\u2019re looking at the cost side of the business to see what do we have to do with pricing to make sure that we keep up with inflation.\nMario Cortellacci: Got it. And then, if I could sneak in just one more. You had mentioned weather, and I don\u2019t know if I missed it during the prepared remarks. Are you able to help quantify what the weather impact was on volumes in the quarter?\nDevina Rankin: It\u2019s really difficult to specifically point to volumes. But, what we looked at is basically a month-by-month view of our volume trends. And what we saw is a significant downward pressure in the month of February, some carryover of that into -- or recovery of that, I should say, in March, but we don\u2019t know how much was true recovery of volume lost in February versus just continued momentum as we see economic recovery from the pandemic. We certainly think that it\u2019s the latter. And we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019ll continue to see growth based on what we are seeing in the month of April thus far.\nJim Fish: I think it\u2019s fair to say though that it was not insignificant. I mean, when we have to shut down the entire state of Texas for a week and shut down our Gulf Coast operations which are very important operations for us from a special waste standpoint, for example. We shut down our -- a lot of our operations in areas like Tennessee, I mean that was shut down for almost an entire week. So, it was not an insignificant impact. It\u2019s part of why the volume story is a little clouded for the first quarter, and then why John gave some details on what January and February look like versus March and April.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Walter Spracklin, RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: So, I\u2019d like to start just on -- obviously, you had a great quarter with -- from a cash flow generation standpoint, an indication that that trend is continuing. Just curious how that impacts, how you look at M&A. Does that more dry powder make you more incented to look a little harder for M&A? Obviously, your experience here with AW is going very well, or is it the case that you\u2019re kind of concentrated on the integration, you\u2019re preoccupied with that and M&A outside of any tuck-ins is -- any larger scale M&A outside of any tuck-ins is probably not in the cards?\nJim Fish: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s probably more of the latter. We are still very focused on ADS integration. But look, our -- what we\u2019re hearing internally is that there is quite a bit of interest probably driven as much as anything by the potential for tax law changes coming. And so, I think you\u2019re seeing the pipeline starts to build a little bit. We, at this point, are saying bottom end of the range, the historical range of $100 million to $200 million, and that\u2019s what we said when we gave guidance back in February, and we\u2019re sticking to that right now. It\u2019s possible though, it\u2019s always possible that something comes along and it\u2019s too good to pass up. And I think what you\u2019ll probably see is that you may see that valuations actually -- it\u2019s really just a math equation. You may see valuations come down a little bit because somebody is looking and saying, all right, my capital gain here is going to be pretty significant. And here\u2019s what the cost of that is at the higher capital gains rates. So, I\u2019m willing to come down a little bit in terms of my sales price. Don\u2019t know for a fact that that\u2019s what happens, but it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if that happens. But for us, right now, Walter, we\u2019re really focused on ADS integration, we\u2019re sticking with the bottom end of that range at $100 million.\nWalter Spracklin: That makes sense. Okay. And my second question here is on coming back to your contracts and how might the pandemic have given you an opportunity to get better yield without raising your core price. And here, I\u2019m referencing to structurally charging more or charging on a weight basis as opposed to a per household. But, is there anything that you\u2019re looking at now that is allowing you to make a greater return on your contracts with your customers, commercial, residential or otherwise, that goes beyond just simply higher price.\nJim Fish: Well, there really are a couple of dynamics taking place with price. If you set aside recycling and just talk about commercial, industrial and resi -- if we talk about really commercial, I mentioned earlier that we\u2019re moving some of that to fee-based. And so, that is a component of price, and it\u2019s an important component of price, and we think that that has -- that\u2019s going to help -- and that has helped and will continue to help commercial and industrial. And then, on residential, John\u2019s talked about residential now for two or three years. And we really look at residential as being one of the real strong points for the quarter. The work that his team -- John and his team have done to get to the highest yield since 2008, a 4% yield has really been a success story for the Company. And that\u2019s coming as much as anything through -- maybe not as much with fee-based as it\u2019s coming through contract renegotiation. It might surprise you to know that that\u2019s not coming from some of the indexes going up. We actually saw a small amount of deterioration in that for the quarter. Now, we do expect that that -- we do expect that inflation will kick up a little bit, and so we\u2019ll get some help. And we\u2019re typically a beneficiary of higher inflation. But, we didn\u2019t benefit in Q1 from that. It was really all a -- almost all of it was just renegotiation of contracts. And factoring in to those contracts, the fact that we now expect weights to be a bit higher permanently because of the pandemic and because of somewhat of a permanent shift of some portion of the economy to a work from home environment. But, this was really all -- and then, by the way, there\u2019s also this ongoing move to a different index that\u2019s more reflective of our cost structure, which is a water, sewer, trash index away from a CPI index. And we\u2019re up to about 40% of our overall business is index driven and about 40% of that is now on a water, sewer, trash, which then equates to about 15% or 16% in total.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from the of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Hey Jim. So, back at our conference, you talked about some pretty stark differences in the small container volumes in reopened versus not reopened markets. And I realize you may not have all the data right there at your fingertips. But, can you just give us some flavor of how, say, like a Texas or Florida small container track versus, call it, Ontario, Canada. Just maybe something like that. I\u2019m just curious to get a little more color there.\nJim Fish: Right. So, Tyler, you\u2019re right. We talked about some of those states that were early in reopening like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Tennessee and how they were showing real nice signs of recovery, but have other states maybe not as much. The good news is that we\u2019re starting to see some of those states that were in the latter group reopening. California is a good example. We\u2019re seeing some reopening in California. We\u2019re seeing some reopening in New England. We\u2019re seeing some reopening in the Upper Midwest and Illinois. I would say that right now, Tyler, the area that is still showing the greatest softness that has not come to the party yet, is Canada, and it\u2019s mostly Eastern Canada. That -- I looked at the numbers this morning, in fact, and still showing weakness in Canada, and it really has to do with the fact that they\u2019ve remained shut down. We\u2019re still showing a little bit of softness also in New York and Michigan. But, the number of areas that are in that latter group, the software group is shrinking, and that\u2019s good news. And so, I think I would add a couple then to the list that I gave you at your conference to just the Texas and Florida. We\u2019ve got a few new entrants there that are helping.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. But those, Texas and Florida, are they tracking up in small container?\nJim Fish: Yes. So, I looked at Florida\u2019s number yesterday, and Florida looks great. I would tell you the only challenge there is on the labor side. It\u2019s that competing against somebody sitting on the couch. And so, while we didn\u2019t have layoffs as a result of COVID, as the business grows, we have a need to add drivers, add technicians. We have a number of open recs there. And I\u2019m not going to tell you it\u2019s been easy to fill those. But, we do think that\u2019s temporary. We don\u2019t think those -- that we\u2019re competing against the government forever. We think it\u2019s probably third quarter when the government starts to realize that that ultimately needs to go away, that there\u2019s enough jobs out there to fill without providing the added unemployment benefit. But yes, Florida is doing real well right now. But a lot of that hospitality is coming back in Florida. And I would say, the same in Arizona, the same really in Texas, too.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, Devina So, if I took the midpoint of the EBITDA guidance, I think the raise was about $100 million. So, I\u2019m curious how -- so I\u2019m curious how that breaks down. So, it sounds like there\u2019s maybe 20 of additional ADS synergies, but then it sounds like there\u2019s a little bit of actually a drag on incentive comp. But basically, of the remaining, how much of that is simply commodities, and how much of that is improving IRG?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Tyler. I think way that we\u2019re thinking about it, and you highlighted ADS, we\u2019re thinking about ADS as being an important component to the overall collection and disposal business. And the collection and disposal business with ADS synergy capture is over half of the expected $100 million lift in EBITDA, with a lot of that coming from expectations for stronger pricing, expectations for strong cost discipline and then there\u2019s a big offset for the incentive compensation that we discussed. So, when you have about half of that related to strong solid waste, it\u2019s a really strong indication of the strength of those two indicators. Then, on the commodity side, we\u2019ve got a combination of the recycling line of business and RINs. And on the recycling commodity piece, we have about $35 million there and about $20 million from RIN value.\nTyler Brown: Okay. So, collection and disposal up, it gets completely offset by incentive comp, and then commodities is kind of the other piece, if I\u2019m...\nDevina Rankin: Yes. Not completely offset by incentive comp. It just takes away from the headline number for solid waste.\nTyler Brown: Okay. And then, just I know there\u2019s been a lot of change with the fee for service change in resi. So, what is a $10 sensitivity to a $10 move in the commodity basket, either in terms of EPS or EBITDA these days?\nJohn Morris: Yes. Tyler, on the recycling, I\u2019m assuming -- I presume that\u2019s what you meant. So yes, I mean you saw some of that in my prepared comments about an average rate in Q1 of 79 versus historical high averages in the mid to high-120s. And as I also mentioned, we\u2019ve doubled the EBITDA quarter-over-quarter for the year. So, we\u2019re very happy there. To answer your question specifically, I would say it\u2019s about 23% to 25% of that move or $23 million on $10, if you want to look at it that way. What I would caution you by saying that, and I\u2019ve made this comment on a number of these calls, again, that math is correct. It doesn\u2019t slide up and down the same way as it used to because again, we\u2019ve put floors in place from an inbound customer standpoint. We\u2019ve got better and secured outlets on the outbound side. I mean, we\u2019re seeing strong domestic and export markets right now, which is really helping us, on the outbound pricing side, and we\u2019ve got more security around some of those rates. So, the math I gave you is right at a point in time if commodity price went way far south, which we don\u2019t expect, we expect them to stay hanging there for the next handful of years. That math would change. But about $23 million for that $10 move is where we\u2019re at for Q1.\nJim Fish: And cents per share then, Tyler, it\u2019s about -- and within this band that John just described, this price band, it is about $0.04 for a $10 move.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey, Jim. Thank you for everybody, Jim, Devina, John, Ed, for taking questions. So, can I tease out Devina a little bit more off of Tyler\u2019s questions? If we\u2019ve got greater than 50% is benefited by the collection and disposal. So, that\u2019s $55 million. And then, there\u2019s $55 million from recycling and RINs. Is the compensation number then just $10 million? I mean I just -- I want to get this right.\nDevina Rankin: The compensation impact right now, our estimate and this can change based on our performance, the compensation estimate is a total of about $25 million. And so, when you look at the solid waste piece, my comment was it\u2019s more than 50%. So, we take the $55 million from commodity, the $25 million offset from incentive compensation that gets you to $30 million. So, you\u2019ve got about $70 million at solid waste. And it\u2019s a combination of synergy capture from the ADS business and the strong performance from legacy WM.\nMichael Hoffman: All right. And that was the important part of it. So, on the WM piece, that\u2019s about asset utilization, incremental price because you lowered your churn, improved your core. That\u2019s the -- it\u2019s a little bit of all those things sum up together, right? So, for that incremental\u2026\nDevina Rankin: That\u2019s exactly right.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. Okay. And then, John, yes, there was a question earlier about labor. I mean, one of the things to caution everybody is, you may make a decision to walk over time up not to add capital, drive more trucks at a higher rate and then add a truck at a high level of utilization instead of adding a truck at a lower level of utilization. We have to be careful when we look at the balancing out of some of those numbers. Is that -- over time, is that correct?\nJohn Morris: Yes. That\u2019s fair, Michael. I think, what we\u2019ve also learned through this is that as the volume really kind of the tide went out on volume, I think the team did really a good job from an asset utilization standpoint. And what we\u2019ve learned is, is that we can see some efficiency gains to be made by shortening of the work week, if you will, from 5 or 6 days to 4 or 5 days. And we worked pretty hard through the pandemic to make sure we flex down. And I think that\u2019s what you see in our efficiency numbers, our asset utilization numbers, our labor numbers. And then, as we flex back up to your point, I mean, there\u2019s going to reach a point where we theoretically have to add another truck. But, to my earlier comments because we created that capacity, we feel we\u2019ve got some leverage certainly throughout this year to be able to take on those additional volumes without real big incremental costs.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. And it\u2019s things like let\u2019s not work half a day on Saturday, which is overtime. You can get the work all done in five days kind of thing. That\u2019s the stuff you\u2019ve kept?\nJohn Morris: Yes. Okay. So, at the end of last year or in fourth quarter, you gave us a number of -- the total number of customers that weren\u2019t open yet at the end of the calendar year. Where does that number stand today?\nDevina Rankin: Is this the recovery of commercial collection that we talked about being at about 70% of the COVID losses? Is that what you\u2019re referring to, Michael?\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. So I -- and the distinction being a customer because if they could restart but have less volume. So, I want to be careful of there\u2019s a ton issue, but there\u2019s also a customer, once they\u2019re back on, that\u2019s revenue came back on, whether the can was fuller, partially full. I don\u2019t care. The revenue came back on. So, I\u2019m trying to -- so when you say the 72%, is it 72% of the not open physically or the tonnage?\nJim Fish: It\u2019s -- Michael, we\u2019ve referenced that 72% number. That\u2019s of yards lost and then yards recovered. So, it\u2019s units.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. Okay. But you still have a lot of customers that\u2026\nJim Fish: Mike, we do think that there\u2019s a percentage of businesses that -- and we don\u2019t know what that is at this point, but there\u2019s a percentage of businesses that are going to be much longer in reopening. And so, because this was such a unique event that we had never seen before, we don\u2019t know exactly how that -- how that reopening occurs. But, we do know that there are some businesses -- and likely -- and to Tyler\u2019s question, likely in those states that were -- that took longer to reopen. I mean, Texas reopened at least partially on the 17th of May last year and then fully reopened later in the year in the third quarter. But, some of the states, they closed until 2021. And if you were a small business in Texas or in Florida or in Arizona, you probably were able to weather the storm. If you were a small business in Michigan or in Toronto, you may have -- you may still be having a tough time weathering the storm. So, we don\u2019t know exactly what that -- how many of those customers actually just simply don\u2019t come back. There will be some amount there for sure. But we are, by the way, looking a bit at -- I know a lot of industries are comparing to 2019. And because comparisons are going to start to get really quirky, they already are. I mean, comparing to 2020 for any metric is difficult. I\u2019ll give you one number that\u2019s very encouraging for us, and that\u2019s the EBITDA number. It\u2019s part of why we were so excited about the quarter and about actually raising guidance. When you look at 2019 EBITDA for WM legacy and you add it to kind of ADS legacy, you get something in the neighborhood of kind of 4.8 -- about $4.85 billion. And then, you look at what we just adjusted to, and it\u2019s $100 million above that. Keep in mind, that\u2019s not really fair to do that because we divested a bunch of ADS legacies. But, even if you don\u2019t count that, if you just say WM legacy \u201819 and ADS legacy \u201819, you\u2019re talking $4.85 billion, and we\u2019re $100 million above that, and we have not gotten a lot of the volume back, and we still have a lot of room to go in terms of ADS. So, that\u2019s one of the many reasons why we were very encouraged with the quarter and very able to take that unusual step to raise guidance.\nMichael Hoffman: All right. And that helps a lot. And to follow your thought all the way through, you sold $100 million of EBITDA approximately. So, you\u2019re really up net $200 million on the combination of the two companies and you still have room to go?\nJim Fish: Yes. We did have to sell some. That\u2019s for sure.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. Okay. John, you mentioned service intervals improved. So, just to be clear, are you seeing -- this is a COVID customer restarting and then the interval improved or existing business on the interval improved or a combination of all that?\nJohn Morris: I think it\u2019s a combination, Mike, a couple of numbers. I mean service increases outpacing decreases. That\u2019s been the case for a while, but it\u2019s -- the gap is actually widening. So, you can argue about what that points do. But overall, we\u2019ve seen a good trend there. And the churn number, we always talked about what was structural out at churn number. We were at 8.2% for the quarter, down from 9% and change. So, we view that obviously as a good indicator. And then, to my points earlier, Michael, about buying in particular on commercial, it\u2019s hard to look at the January -- excuse me, the Q1 this year versus last year. But sequentially, when you look at Q4, and then I pan across January, February, certainly not strong months, partly weather, partly all the other stuff we\u2019ve mentioned. But then I look at March and what the trends are into April and small containers, and we\u2019re certainly encouraged there as well.\nMichael Hoffman: All right. And then, last one for me, and this is a little bit of a on-site quarter. I think, the garbage industry has one of the greatest opportunities to influence scope 3 emissions, which are downstream from you. It\u2019s your vendors, your suppliers. So, on Tara\u2019s remit, what is the opportunity there? Because I think your business model forces those suppliers and vendors to have to sort of change the way they do things to meet your needs.\nJim Fish: Let me give you an example of where you\u2019re right on that. And it\u2019s golf tournament. We have made the golf tournament zero waste now for 9 -- I think 9 consecutive years, maybe 10 consecutive years. And so, we take a very -- we play a very influential role there with the vendors or with the fans coming in. And while it\u2019s not going to be identical to that, we certainly, to your point, can play an influential role in sustainability. And that\u2019s why we look at it as such a differentiator for us. It\u2019s why we felt that strongly about putting a senior level person in charge of it. But I think you\u2019re absolutely right about that, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: All right. Well, nice job Thanks for doing something very unusual. 33 years and I can\u2019t remember the last time somebody raised guidance on the first quarter.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Sean Eastman, KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: Hi, guys. Strong start to the year. Congrats. Devina, you mentioned in the Q&A sort of not explicitly updating the margin guidance, you\u2019re sort of still keeping your eye on that contribution margin into the second quarter volume recovery. I mean, what are the big puts and takes that you\u2019re really keeping your eye on there? And is it fair to say that you are feeling better about that dynamic now with the first quarter closed out strongly?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. It\u2019s a great question. And I think we talked a great deal today about the biggest driver, and that\u2019s the labor cost part of the equation. We certainly think that the efforts that have been put forth by the team to manage overtime hours and get those impacts not just on the service side, but extended through on the repair and maintenance side have been a tremendous value. We want that to continue to be a lever that produces the strong operating margin for the business, and we\u2019re optimistic about that. But, we also know that there are flex points or breakpoints in the equation that happened when you add an additional route. And so, that\u2019s what we\u2019re watching as we move forward from here with the growing volume environment. Aside from labor, I think what\u2019s really important is that we can\u2019t forget that in our transfer and disposal cost and subcontractor costs, there\u2019s a lot of third-party labor costs built into those numbers as well. And so, the theme that Jim has pointed us to a number of times today about the labor pressure that exists across the board, that\u2019s something that we\u2019ve seen in those costs and something we expect to continue into 2021. So, 45% contribution margin is what we\u2019ve talked about. We\u2019re encouraged that we think that that holds, but we think that there could be upside from it. But, the labor piece of the equation is really going to be the piece we have to watch.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, I guess, a more broad question. The cash flow generation performance measure in the stock incentive plan seems to imply that you guys are going to have over $4 billion of deployable free cash flow in a sense over the next three years. I mean, I think we have a good sense of capital deployment priorities for 2021 as you integrate ADSW but there\u2019s a lot of dollars there. And I thought I would check in to see if we could get a bit of a flavor on what\u2019s looking the most interesting, as you look out over that three-year horizon with all that capital.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So, the first priority is investing in the long-term growth of the business, and that\u2019s something that we talk a great deal about. Organic growth through focuses in recycling and renewable energy have been places that we\u2019ve said. You could see some outpaced capital spending from us. So, the current guide for 2021 incorporates our expectations for the full year in those programs. We just have yet to determine how much we could accelerate spend in 2022 and 2023 to cover incremental investment that could be worthwhile in those spaces. I think, the rest of the allocation really comes down to shareholder returns, continuing to grow the dividend over the long term in that 45% to 50% range on a payout ratio basis, and we measure that on free cash flow. So, there\u2019s direct conversion from that free cash flow measure and the long-term incentive plan to award the dividend, which I think is a really strong indicator of how we think about the growth that can happen as we revisit that in the fourth quarter. Beyond that, the statement that we made about at least $1 billion of share buyback in 2021 is an indication that when we don\u2019t see M&A being the place that we will spend that available dollar free cash flow, there is tremendous flexibility to allocate incremental dollars to the shareholders through share buyback. M&A, Jim touched on that. We\u2019ll continue to be sure that we\u2019re mindful of the opportunities that exist there. And if we see opportunities to provide outpaced returns relative to our other opportunities, we\u2019ll be well-positioned to do that with a strong balance sheet that I mentioned.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC.\nKevin Chiang: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions here. And congrats on a strong start to the year. I\u2019m just wondering, as the economy opens, I think, during the pandemic, just given all the government support for small businesses, I think that did cloud some of the analysis in terms of what bad debt could look like as companies came out of this. And I guess, parts of your business have come almost full circle, I guess, and some of this government support is being removed. Is anything playing out that was unexpected in terms of how you accrued for some of these bad debts, or are things coming better or worse or maybe as expected?\nDevina Rankin: I would say that things are recovering as expected. From a cash flow perspective, the really strong result that we had in the current year has to do with the headwind that we experienced in the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, we were between $60 million and $80 million behind on cash flow because we saw our customers slow down their payments. We\u2019ve seen really strong resilience from our customers, and I think our proactive steps to protect our customers, particularly small business through the pandemic has paid dividends in that regard. And so, I will say, we had really good results from a days sales outstanding and bad debt perspective in the first quarter, a little ahead of expectations, but all-in-all, I would say, more close to tracking than leading.\nKevin Chiang: Okay. That\u2019s great news there. And then, maybe just on the opportunities around the landfill gas capture. I know you spoke to this in your prepared remarks. But, it does feel like there\u2019s more private capital flowing to this opportunity, like, I\u2019ve seen, for example, a number of investment announcements around companies looking to partner with landfills on things like sustainable aviation fuel. Are you seeing the cost of capital come down on these kinds of projects, or maybe conversely, is the ROIC improving? Just as a lot of other end markets look to reduce their own carbon intensity and look to landfill gas captures, maybe helping them achieve their own goals?\nJohn Morris: Yes. Kevin, on the third-party front, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s plenty of dollars out there that are looking for a place to park in this space. But, I think what\u2019s important is that the ones -- the four or five plants we have either in operation or that we\u2019ve invested in, are showing some really strong results, and we\u2019re going to continue to look at those opportunities. I think, Devina said, how we finance is a different question. We have the balance sheet to be able to do that. We\u2019ve got a fleet of 130 or so plants, so handful of those are the RNG plants. As Jim mentioned, we\u2019re closing the loop and fueling over half our fleet with renewable natural gas, which we think long term, that is a great solution for us. And we\u2019ve clearly got some runway to go before we even consume all of our capabilities to fuel our own fleet. We\u2019re happy with the space and the investments we have for sure.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: John, just looking at the $50 million of upsized ADS synergies targeted here, can you give us maybe the two or three big factors that are really driving that? Where are you getting greater savings than previously targeted? And then, I think this will help investors understand, what substantively you\u2019re actually doing here to improve the returns?\nJohn Morris: Well, certainly, you\u2019ve heard us talk in the last few quarters, the integration has kicked off and has gone well. A lot of the elements of the integration risks seem to be going better than expected. We talked about data migration being kind of long pole, last long pole in the tent. That\u2019s coming along nicely as we\u2019re that information over to our system. That\u2019s important now because in order to get the routing synergies around consolidations, we need to have all the information in one database. But specifically to your question, I mean, a public, public deal, we didn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t get the same look under the hoods maybe with a private deal. And once we dig it under the hood, what we found is, is that the areas that are impacted are finding out that they can operate the business more efficiently than we even thought going into it. Secondly, I think on internalization and transportation synergies is another bucket where again, once we got a look at some of that detail, we were able to drive out additional synergies. And then, lastly, really on the supply chain side, even though we\u2019re facing a couple of headwinds on some commodity-related pieces, our supply chain group, once they got to look at the whole portfolio of spend there has also been able to drive some additional benefit. So, it\u2019s really efficiency in the business in the field is the internalization, the transportation and disposal internalization. And then, lastly, it\u2019s really some of the corporate synergies around supply chain. Those are the three big buckets.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. That\u2019s super helpful, John. And then, I guess, a question for Jim and the team broadly. I\u2019m just curious to know how you\u2019re engaging so far with the new administration on some of the priorities they focused on in terms of climate pledges, they\u2019re clearly taking a whole of government approach that includes EPA. Also, it\u2019s clear that waste reduction is for some parts of the government focus as well. So, just can you talk about some of the engagement that you\u2019ve had so far in some of the focus areas for you as we kind of get in kind of almost what, one quarter, all the way through the year of this first administration.\nJim Fish: Well, so you mentioned EPA, and that\u2019s where our engagement has been largely. We were -- we\u2019ve been engaged with them for not just the quarter that the new administration has been in office, but for quite some time before that. But, because of that engagement with them, we do know that there are changes coming through the EPA down the pipe, and we\u2019re prepared for those. And I think the -- we\u2019ve mentioned this before, but in a sort of way, we believe we end up being a beneficiary of some of these changes coming from EPA because we\u2019ve always held ourselves to a much higher standard environmentally. So, to the extent that the bar gets raised by the new administration, it actually ends up being a benefit to us. The other areas, Devina has talked about the potential for tax changes and things like that. And so, we\u2019re keeping up on that. I personally have not had any engagement with the new administration, nor did I have engagement with the last administration. I guess, they don\u2019t value our opinion that much. But, that\u2019s okay. We\u2019re happy to fly under the radar.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I\u2019ll just ask one, actually a follow-up from the last one. The President has proposed a pretty aggressive infrastructure program. I know there\u2019s some people thinking that may not all the spending be infrastructure-related. But, I\u2019m just curious from what you\u2019ve seen so far, do you think there\u2019ll be any benefits to your Company from if any things come to fruition?\nJim Fish: Look, I think, an infrastructure bill is going to be a positive for us, any way you slice it. But there is a question about what the details of that bill are. I don\u2019t think anybody knows at this point. And there still is a lot of Nash compete [ph] that\u2019s going to need to take place within -- in Congress to figure out those details. So, there could be an infrastructure build that ends up being even better for us, depending on the details of it. But any infrastructure bill is, I think, good for the economy and ultimately good for us.\nJeff Silber: Can you give some examples of what those details might be that could benefit you?\nJim Fish: Well, so, an infrastructure bill, for example, that focuses on road construction or bridges or big projects like that. That is -- that will -- we would certainly be a beneficiary of that. An infrastructure build that focuses on a reduction in natural disasters, that\u2019s a much, much longer term benefit. So, I don\u2019t know that that -- I don\u2019t know that the infrastructure spending that then in turn turns into fewer hurricanes is going to benefit us -- that\u2019s going to be harder to see. I\u2019ll put it that way. But certainly, infrastructure bill, as we think about airports, as we think about roads and bridges, all of that, we end up being a beneficiary, both on the collection side of our business and the disposal side.\nOperator: And our next question will come from the line of David Manthey with Baird.\nDavid Manthey: One last cut here at the guidance walk, if I could. So, you\u2019re saying the EBITDA guidance is up by about $100 million, and I believe you\u2019re saying the compensation expense will offset pretty much the ADS synergies. So, if we just set those things on the side. If your revenue midpoint is up by 266, EBITDA is up by 100, that looks like a high-30s kind of contribution margin. And what I\u2019m asking here is, it seems like if you\u2019re saying most of the revenue upside is coming from yield and commodities and growth in higher-margin segments. Are you introducing a factor of conservatism here, or is there another element we\u2019re missing?\nDevina Rankin: What I mentioned earlier about the cost headwinds that we know are coming, they were particularly strong in the second quarter 2021 outlook. And so, our expectations currently are certainly that we could outperform on the margin side relative to where we stand today. But, to build it in before we\u2019ve seen the volume acceleration we thought would be not necessarily prudent based on where we stand. And we knew that $100 million lift in EBITDA from just two months ago was a really strong indication of the strength of the overall business. So, is there upside, potentially that it would have to come from how we see the cost side of the equation flow through as we see volume returns.\nJim Fish: But, I think, we\u2019re always -- you\u2019re always going to see this Company, this management team and really even the industry be somewhat conservative. We\u2019re a fairly conservative Company and industry. So, to your question about conservatism, I mean, I would say you\u2019re always going to see us be fairly conservative, which is why, to Devina\u2019s point, it was such a unique event for us to raise guidance after just one quarter. I mean, every time that I can remember, and I\u2019m just about to hit my 20th year with the Company, we\u2019ve had a first quarter, even a really good first quarter where we\u2019ve just reaffirmed guidance. I think, we did have one quarter where we lowered guidance after one quarter. But, this is pretty unique for us to raise guidance. But with that said, we\u2019re always thoughtful about it. And there is a level of conservatism in everything we do.\nOperator: And our last question today is going to come from the line of Michael Feniger with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nMichael Feniger: Okay, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in today. And I\u2019ll just keep it very short. I mean, obviously, the industry has been more disciplined. You guys are talking about the focus on the price. We saw the improvement in churn. I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m wondering, Jim, as you see things open up and volumes do come up, it seems like maybe just reopening is getting pushed out a little bit based on the commentary in sort of April and May, maybe it\u2019s getting pushed out. But, when you do see the opening, are you going to see some small players that have kind of been struggling? Are they going to try to grab that volume? Do you have to walk away from some areas where you think it might get a little too competitive on that volume focus on the higher-margin areas? I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re seeing that kind of play out when this reopening really does pick up more steam. Thank you.\nJim Fish: Yes. Michael, maybe a little bit. I mean, honestly, if you look at -- I talked about the improvement we made in the residential line of business. And we have walked away from some contracts there. And so, I think you\u2019ll see some of that. I think, you will always see us look at volume with -- look at it pretty carefully because not all volume is created equal. And so, as we think about this reopening, as I said earlier, there may be some volume that we just simply elect not to take. And that might help us not only in terms of margin and in terms of operating performance, but it might also help our operations teams as they look at having to hire to accommodate that volume.\nMichael Feniger: Yes. Are you seeing that, Jim, in some of the places that have reopened, maybe some of those mom-and-pops that have been struggling much more than you guys? Are they starting to get a little competitive there as we\u2019re going to see some of these regions and states open back up?\nJim Fish: Look, I don\u2019t -- it\u2019s a competitive industry. So, there are always going to be -- there\u2019s no shortage of competition in our space. And I honestly -- just anecdotally, I didn\u2019t see a whole lot of small businesses go away in our -- at least in our industry. So, I don\u2019t necessarily think you\u2019re going to see a whole lot come back, because those that were there pre-pandemic are still there. And it\u2019s a competitive space no matter who is competing. So, I think we do a nice job of -- the beauty for us is I think we\u2019re doing a really nice job of differentiating ourselves. So, it\u2019s not just based on price. It\u2019s based on a service offering. It\u2019s based on this customer service digitalization that we\u2019ve talked about. And that ultimately is what we look to differentiate ourselves and give us the ability to raise price, so that we\u2019re not just staring at a commodity competition.\nMichael Feniger: And Devina, just so we\u2019re clear, because I might have missed this. Like obviously, April and May are the comps with the year-over-year with what happened last year. Like, how are we thinking about this volume, the 2% volume number with the second half and Q2? Have you guys -- I might have missed this. Have you framed any ranges of how to think about that easy comp in the second quarter and then really the second half, how that plays out?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Michael. Those estimates are really difficult to predict. But, I would tell you, our math at this point tells us that it\u2019s around 6% volume in Q2 and then closer to the 1.5% to 2% in the back half of the year.\nOperator: Thank you. That will conclude the Q&A session of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Holly. Just a quick ending comment, I just want to reiterate how much we appreciate. We now have 50,000 -- almost 51,000 folks here that have made a huge contribution to the success of this quarter and continue to do so day in and day out. So, thanks to all of you for your contribution. And thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you for participating in today\u2019s Waste Management Conference Call.

            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. It was said many times last year that 2020 was a year like no other. For many reasons, it was an incredibly difficult and trying year. Yet our positive message internally was the great companies use tough times to better themselves, and that's precisely what WM did. And first quarter of 2021 showed that with an exclamation point. We had an exceptionally strong start to the year as we kept our focus on those fundamentals that have always been is great. Our people first, then our customers, and then we focus on the details of our business. And that order inevitably produces the best results. In Q1, it sure did as we achieved record operating EBITDA of $1.16 billion and robust cash from operations of $1.12 billion. Typically, during our first quarter earnings call, we reaffirm our full year guidance. However, as we view these strong results, in addition to our confidence in the transformative changes we're making to our business model and the fact that we have yet to see a full recovery in our critical landfill commercial and industrial volumes, it became clear that we're on track to outperform our guidance from only two months ago. Combine this with the broader economic trends and all indicators show that our full year revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow are on track to meet or exceed the upper end of the guidance ranges we provided in February. Devina will discuss our updated guidance, but it's safe to say, we're very excited about our performance for the first quarter, and we expect to show continued strength throughout the year. We're seeing tangible benefits from the investments that we've made in recycling and renewable energy. In our recycling line of business, we've developed a model for all new plants which with the addition of sophisticated technology produces far better returns through a combination of added efficiencies, a higher quality of saleable material, and less residual material for disposal at the end of the process, all while our basket of recycled commodity prices have climbed back nicely to historical average price levels. Additionally, three years ago, we made the decision to close the loop between our natural gas fleet and the gas produced at our landfills by investing in the renewable energy business. We're now seeing those investments pay healthy dividends with approximately two to three-year paybacks on our four plants, in tandem with greater stability and higher pricing in the renewable energy markets. As we discussed last quarter, WM is also well-positioned to leverage our ESG leadership and particularly our focus on environmental sustainability to help our customers meet their own climate goals through recycling and other beneficial uses such as renewable energy generation. We're in a unique position to help key stakeholders rise to the challenge. And we can do this while growing our business at the same time, collaborating with our stakeholders to find new ways to create value together. Continuing to integrate environmental sustainability into our strategic business framework for long-term sustainable and profitable growth requires a strong focus, which is why we've taken a step to dedicate a member of our senior team to this effort. I'm pleased to announce that Tara Hemmer, Senior Vice President of Operations, will be taking this new role as Senior Vice President, Chief Sustainability Officer reporting directly to me effective July 1. With Tara's move, our Area Vice President leading the Greater Mid-Atlantic area, Rafa Carrasco, will be promoted to a member of the senior leadership team as Senior Vice President of Operations. We've also launched a new exciting education benefit for our team members this month that will provide development and upskilling opportunities for our workforce. These changes underscore how the tenants of ESG are embedded into our broader business strategy. As digital transformation sweeps across nearly every industry in the way of the pandemic, we're making strides in differentiating our customers' experience through end-to-end digital transformation. Today, our customers can manage their relationship with us through online -- through our online My WM platform, which is connected operationally through our Smart Truck technology and supported by our customer analytics and data management tools. Our newly automated setup process streamlines customer orders and accelerates the speed at which we can deliver on our commitments while also reducing our cost to serve. These developments, combined with continued growth of our e-commerce channel, give us confidence that our decision to accelerate technology investments was the right one, and we will emerge from the pandemic a stronger, more agile company. In closing, I want to thank the entire Waste Management team for their hard work and dedication that has positioned us for a record-setting 2021. WM is well-positioned to benefit from the continued reopening as more states and provinces emerge from the pandemic, and we expect our commercial, industrial and landfill businesses, our three most lines of business, to benefit from further volume recovery and produce robust financial results with high incremental margins over the remainder of the year. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Yes, Jerry. What I would tell you is if you looked at our performance throughout the kind of COVID, the volume slide, if you will, efficiencies improved throughout, obviously, as I mentioned, our management of over time certainly improved. And what that also did is helped us build some capacity in the system. So, as we look at the rest of 2020, what we've revised guidance to, we feel like we're in good shape to absorb that volume. Yes. Jerry, I think you make great. We've looked at 2019, we've looked at 2020, and really, what we've done is looked at Q4 of 2020 to look at some of the sequential trends on volume. And that's really where I think we see what we hear a level of confidence is. January, February were certainly challenging months, partly due to weather, partly due to just the comp year-over-year. Really happy with what we saw in March on the volume front and equally pleased with what we're seeing in April. So, while we've looked at 2020, 2019, we've really focused on what the sequential improvement has been, and that's part of why you heard the message from us about how we feel about the balance of the year. Yes. So, we have -- as I mentioned, we have four plants. Now, we have a fifth that would be coming on line in 2022. That capital is being spent right now. That's in the plan. So, that Devina mentioned. This is -- we believe it's a nice opportunity for us, and it's made possible because of the fact that our fleets now -- we are -- almost at 70% of our routed fleet is CNG. And considering that that includes the ADS trucks, which are at a much lower percentage, we think there's a couple of benefits there. One is, just the simple shift from diesel to natural gas is definitely a good shift for us. And then, as you mentioned, the fact that we're able to close that loop between those natural gas trucks and the gas produced at our landfills, we like the investment. We started making this investment two or three years ago. They have -- at current pricing, they have really good returns. And I think you'll see us continue to do that as we're doing this year, and I expect we'll continue to do it next year. Yes. When we look at 2021 on a year-over-year basis, we knew we had some cost headwinds. And in particular, the second quarter had some cost headwinds for health and welfare specifically. We also expected incentive compensation to be a headwind for the full year, though that's even greater headwind now because of our strong outlook for 2021 than we would have initially expected. Our overall margin guidance for 2021 initially was as much as a 50 basis-point improvement. You can see with the strong performance in the first quarter. We expect there could be some upside to that, though rather than update margins specifically at this point, we'd really like to see the seasonal results on volume because the contribution margin from that incremental volume is one of the important things for us to keep our eye on. That being said, I think it's really important to step back and recognize that we started with guidance that could have been slightly backward at 20 basis points on a year-over-year comparison, both because of those comp headwinds and the integration of ADS. But then, when we look at where we stand today, we're confident that we'll actually be at the high end of our expectations of 50 basis points. And that's certainly somewhat because of the ADS synergy capture, but it's also because of some stronger outlook on pricing that I mentioned earlier. Yes. So, landfill pricing, as you know, is always a top priority for us. MSW core price was strong for the quarter as were the other lines of business. I think, an important distinction here is that several of these lines of business, specifically commercial, also as we've talked many times about recycling, have become somewhat fee-based. And so, as volume increases, you see fees increase, and those fees go to the price line. So, it's honestly part of why -- there's a number of reasons why we took the unusual step to raise guidance in Q1. But, one of those is the strength that we're seeing in pricing. And of course, a second one is that when you think about volumes, and I mentioned it in my remarks, that volumes really have not recovered fully, especially in those three high-margin lines of business, commercial, landfill and industrial. John mentioned that we're starting to see really good green shoots in March and continuing into April on the volume front. And then, lastly, on reasons why we felt really comfortable with our guidance changes was that recycling is, as John mentioned in his script, we're producing these great results recycling at average commodity prices. I mean $79 for that basket of commodities is right in the middle of our historical averages, whereas the other four quarters, we talked about the top five -- being in the top five best quarters of all time in recycling, and yet the other four when we were up at $125, $127 on an average commodity price, we're now down at 79%, at least that's where we were for the quarter. So, all of those combined to give us real confidence going forward that we could raise guidance. But pricing and landfill pricing in particular we think are a strength for the quarter and will continue to be in the next couple of quarters. Yes. We -- look, I think ADS will go through a similar price model that WM legacy goes through. So, what we've really been focused on in terms of synergies is the cost synergies Obviously, with respect to ADS, just as with WM legacy, we're looking at the cost side of the business to see what do we have to do with pricing to make sure that we keep up with inflation. I think it's fair to say though that it was not insignificant. I mean, when we have to shut down the entire state of Texas for a week and shut down our Gulf Coast operations which are very important operations for us from a special waste standpoint, for example. We shut down our -- a lot of our operations in areas like Tennessee, I mean that was shut down for almost an entire week. So, it was not an insignificant impact. It's part of why the volume story is a little clouded for the first quarter, and then why John gave some details on what January and February look like versus March and April. Yes. I mean, it's probably more of the latter. We are still very focused on ADS integration. But look, our -- what we're hearing internally is that there is quite a bit of interest probably driven as much as anything by the potential for tax law changes coming. And so, I think you're seeing the pipeline starts to build a little bit. We, at this point, are saying bottom end of the range, the historical range of $100 million to $200 million, and that's what we said when we gave guidance back in February, and we're sticking to that right now. It's possible though, it's always possible that something comes along and it's too good to pass up. And I think what you'll probably see is that you may see that valuations actually -- it's really just a math equation. You may see valuations come down a little bit because somebody is looking and saying, all right, my capital gain here is going to be pretty significant. And here's what the cost of that is at the higher capital gains rates. So, I'm willing to come down a little bit in terms of my sales price. Don't know for a fact that that's what happens, but it wouldn't surprise me if that happens. But for us, right now, Walter, we're really focused on ADS integration, we're sticking with the bottom end of that range at $100 million. Well, there really are a couple of dynamics taking place with price. If you set aside recycling and just talk about commercial, industrial and resi -- if we talk about really commercial, I mentioned earlier that we're moving some of that to fee-based. And so, that is a component of price, and it's an important component of price, and we think that that has -- that's going to help -- and that has helped and will continue to help commercial and industrial. And then, on residential, John's talked about residential now for two or three years. And we really look at residential as being one of the real strong points for the quarter. The work that his team -- John and his team have done to get to the highest yield since 2008, a 4% yield has really been a success story for the Company. And that's coming as much as anything through -- maybe not as much with fee-based as it's coming through contract renegotiation. It might surprise you to know that that's not coming from some of the indexes going up. We actually saw a small amount of deterioration in that for the quarter. Now, we do expect that that -- we do expect that inflation will kick up a little bit, and so we'll get some help. And we're typically a beneficiary of higher inflation. But, we didn't benefit in Q1 from that. It was really all a -- almost all of it was just renegotiation of contracts. And factoring in to those contracts, the fact that we now expect weights to be a bit higher permanently because of the pandemic and because of somewhat of a permanent shift of some portion of the economy to a work from home environment. But, this was really all -- and then, by the way, there's also this ongoing move to a different index that's more reflective of our cost structure, which is a water, sewer, trash index away from a CPI index. And we're up to about 40% of our overall business is index driven and about 40% of that is now on a water, sewer, trash, which then equates to about 15% or 16% in total. Right. So, Tyler, you're right. We talked about some of those states that were early in reopening like Texas, Florida, Arizona, Tennessee and how they were showing real nice signs of recovery, but have other states maybe not as much. The good news is that we're starting to see some of those states that were in the latter group reopening. California is a good example. We're seeing some reopening in California. We're seeing some reopening in New England. We're seeing some reopening in the Upper Midwest and Illinois. I would say that right now, Tyler, the area that is still showing the greatest softness that has not come to the party yet, is Canada, and it's mostly Eastern Canada. That -- I looked at the numbers this morning, in fact, and still showing weakness in Canada, and it really has to do with the fact that they've remained shut down. We're still showing a little bit of softness also in New York and Michigan. But, the number of areas that are in that latter group, the software group is shrinking, and that's good news. And so, I think I would add a couple then to the list that I gave you at your conference to just the Texas and Florida. We've got a few new entrants there that are helping. Yes. So, I looked at Florida's number yesterday, and Florida looks great. I would tell you the only challenge there is on the labor side. It's that competing against somebody sitting on the couch. And so, while we didn't have layoffs as a result of COVID, as the business grows, we have a need to add drivers, add technicians. We have a number of open recs there. And I'm not going to tell you it's been easy to fill those. But, we do think that's temporary. We don't think those -- that we're competing against the government forever. We think it's probably third quarter when the government starts to realize that that ultimately needs to go away, that there's enough jobs out there to fill without providing the added unemployment benefit. But yes, Florida is doing real well right now. But a lot of that hospitality is coming back in Florida. And I would say, the same in Arizona, the same really in Texas, too. And cents per share then, Tyler, it's about -- and within this band that John just described, this price band, it is about $0.04 for a $10 move. It's -- Michael, we've referenced that 72% number. That's of yards lost and then yards recovered. So, it's units. Mike, we do think that there's a percentage of businesses that -- and we don't know what that is at this point, but there's a percentage of businesses that are going to be much longer in reopening. And so, because this was such a unique event that we had never seen before, we don't know exactly how that -- how that reopening occurs. But, we do know that there are some businesses -- and likely -- and to Tyler's question, likely in those states that were -- that took longer to reopen. I mean, Texas reopened at least partially on the 17th of May last year and then fully reopened later in the year in the third quarter. But, some of the states, they closed until 2021. And if you were a small business in Texas or in Florida or in Arizona, you probably were able to weather the storm. If you were a small business in Michigan or in Toronto, you may have -- you may still be having a tough time weathering the storm. So, we don't know exactly what that -- how many of those customers actually just simply don't come back. There will be some amount there for sure. But we are, by the way, looking a bit at -- I know a lot of industries are comparing to 2019. And because comparisons are going to start to get really quirky, they already are. I mean, comparing to 2020 for any metric is difficult. I'll give you one number that's very encouraging for us, and that's the EBITDA number. It's part of why we were so excited about the quarter and about actually raising guidance. When you look at 2019 EBITDA for WM legacy and you add it to kind of ADS legacy, you get something in the neighborhood of kind of 4.8 -- about $4.85 billion. And then, you look at what we just adjusted to, and it's $100 million above that. Keep in mind, that's not really fair to do that because we divested a bunch of ADS legacies. But, even if you don't count that, if you just say WM legacy \u201819 and ADS legacy \u201819, you're talking $4.85 billion, and we're $100 million above that, and we have not gotten a lot of the volume back, and we still have a lot of room to go in terms of ADS. So, that's one of the many reasons why we were very encouraged with the quarter and very able to take that unusual step to raise guidance. Yes. We did have to sell some. That's for sure. Let me give you an example of where you're right on that. And it's golf tournament. We have made the golf tournament zero waste now for 9 -- I think 9 consecutive years, maybe 10 consecutive years. And so, we take a very -- we play a very influential role there with the vendors or with the fans coming in. And while it's not going to be identical to that, we certainly, to your point, can play an influential role in sustainability. And that's why we look at it as such a differentiator for us. It's why we felt that strongly about putting a senior level person in charge of it. But I think you're absolutely right about that, Michael. Thanks, Mike. Well, so you mentioned EPA, and that's where our engagement has been largely. We were -- we've been engaged with them for not just the quarter that the new administration has been in office, but for quite some time before that. But, because of that engagement with them, we do know that there are changes coming through the EPA down the pipe, and we're prepared for those. And I think the -- we've mentioned this before, but in a sort of way, we believe we end up being a beneficiary of some of these changes coming from EPA because we've always held ourselves to a much higher standard environmentally. So, to the extent that the bar gets raised by the new administration, it actually ends up being a benefit to us. The other areas, Devina has talked about the potential for tax changes and things like that. And so, we're keeping up on that. I personally have not had any engagement with the new administration, nor did I have engagement with the last administration. I guess, they don't value our opinion that much. But, that's okay. We're happy to fly under the radar. Look, I think, an infrastructure bill is going to be a positive for us, any way you slice it. But there is a question about what the details of that bill are. I don't think anybody knows at this point. And there still is a lot of Nash compete [ph] that's going to need to take place within -- in Congress to figure out those details. So, there could be an infrastructure build that ends up being even better for us, depending on the details of it. But any infrastructure bill is, I think, good for the economy and ultimately good for us. Well, so, an infrastructure bill, for example, that focuses on road construction or bridges or big projects like that. That is -- that will -- we would certainly be a beneficiary of that. An infrastructure build that focuses on a reduction in natural disasters, that's a much, much longer term benefit. So, I don't know that that -- I don't know that the infrastructure spending that then in turn turns into fewer hurricanes is going to benefit us -- that's going to be harder to see. I'll put it that way. But certainly, infrastructure bill, as we think about airports, as we think about roads and bridges, all of that, we end up being a beneficiary, both on the collection side of our business and the disposal side. But, I think, we're always -- you're always going to see this Company, this management team and really even the industry be somewhat conservative. We're a fairly conservative Company and industry. So, to your question about conservatism, I mean, I would say you're always going to see us be fairly conservative, which is why, to Devina's point, it was such a unique event for us to raise guidance after just one quarter. I mean, every time that I can remember, and I'm just about to hit my 20th year with the Company, we've had a first quarter, even a really good first quarter where we've just reaffirmed guidance. I think, we did have one quarter where we lowered guidance after one quarter. But, this is pretty unique for us to raise guidance. But with that said, we're always thoughtful about it. And there is a level of conservatism in everything we do. Yes. Michael, maybe a little bit. I mean, honestly, if you look at -- I talked about the improvement we made in the residential line of business. And we have walked away from some contracts there. And so, I think you'll see some of that. I think, you will always see us look at volume with -- look at it pretty carefully because not all volume is created equal. And so, as we think about this reopening, as I said earlier, there may be some volume that we just simply elect not to take. And that might help us not only in terms of margin and in terms of operating performance, but it might also help our operations teams as they look at having to hire to accommodate that volume. Look, I don't -- it's a competitive industry. So, there are always going to be -- there's no shortage of competition in our space. And I honestly -- just anecdotally, I didn't see a whole lot of small businesses go away in our -- at least in our industry. So, I don't necessarily think you're going to see a whole lot come back, because those that were there pre-pandemic are still there. And it's a competitive space no matter who is competing. So, I think we do a nice job of -- the beauty for us is I think we're doing a really nice job of differentiating ourselves. So, it's not just based on price. It's based on a service offering. It's based on this customer service digitalization that we've talked about. And that ultimately is what we look to differentiate ourselves and give us the ability to raise price, so that we're not just staring at a commodity competition. Thanks, Holly. Just a quick ending comment, I just want to reiterate how much we appreciate. We now have 50,000 -- almost 51,000 folks here that have made a huge contribution to the success of this quarter and continue to do so day in and day out. So, thanks to all of you for your contribution. And thanks to everyone on the call for joining us today."

As you've heard from both Jim and John, we had a fantastic start to 2021 and we forecast continued strength our business as local economies emerge from the pandemic. These strong results and our confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year have led us to raise our full year financial guidance. Revenue growth is expected to be 12.5% to 13% with combined internal revenue growth from yield and volume in the collection and disposal business of 4.5% or greater. The increased outlook is underpinned by our disciplined pricing programs and strong outlook for continued volume recovery. For adjusted operating EBITDA, we now expect to generate between $4.875 billion and $4.975 billion, a $100 million increase at the midpoint from our prior guidance. The improved outlook for adjusted operating EBITDA translates directly into incremental free cash flow. And we now expect that we will generate between $2.325 billion and $2.425 billion of free cash flow for the year. Our team members on the front line continue to deliver and the investments we are making in our people, technology and customer experience are generating strong results. Turning to our first quarter results. Net cash provided by operating activities grew $355 million. The contribution from operating EBITDA growth accounted for a little less than half of that increase, with the remainder coming from lower incentive compensation payments and increasing cash collections from customers, and favorable timing of some of our payables. While we expect some of the timing differences experienced in the first quarter to reverse for the year, the remaining contributors to our strong cash flow from operations results position us for a very strong year. In the first quarter, capital spending was $270 million, a $189 million decrease from the first quarter of 2020. Capital expenditures were lower in the quarter, primarily due to timing, plus the timing of fleet purchases, which we had intentionally front-loaded in 2020 and steps we took in late 2020 to accelerate some of our 2021 capital, given our confidence in the pace of volume recovery. We continue to prioritize the investments in the long-term growth of our business, including recycling, renewable energy and technology investments that we have previously discussed. For the full year, we expect capital spending to be at the high end of our $1.78 billion to $1.88 billion guidance range as we invest in our business to support growth, reduce our cost to serve and extend our environmental sustainability efforts. Putting it all together, our business generated free cash flow of $865 million in the first quarter. The operating EBITDA growth, lower capital expenditures and favorable working capital changes that I discussed drove the significant year-over-year free cash flow increase. This sets us up very well to achieve our increased free cash flow outlook. In the first quarter, we used our free cash flow to pay $247 million in dividends and allocated $250 million to share repurchases. Turning to SG&A costs. SG&A was 10.7% of revenue in the first quarter. That's a 20 basis-point increase over 2020. We remain focused on managing our discretionary costs, optimizing our structure for the ADS acquisition and using SG&A dollars to enhance our business. Our deliberate increased level of investment in technology as well as higher incentive compensation accruals are the driver of SG&A as a percentage of revenue being above our long-term target of less than 10% of revenue. Though we are committed to ensuring we return to that optimized cost structure in the near term. Our first quarter leverage ratio of 3.04 times has improved from the fourth quarter due to our strong operating EBITDA growth. This leverage ratio remains well within the financial covenant of our revolving credit facility and right at the top of our long-term targeted range of 2.5 to 3 times. Our strong first quarter results and increased expectations for current year operating EBITDA and free cash flow, position us to purchase at least $1 billion of our shares in 2021, and at the same time, achieve our target leverage of 2.75 times by the end of the year. Our capital allocation priorities continue to be a strong balance sheet, prudent investment in the growth of our business, and strong and consistent shareholder returns. With the strength of our collection and disposal business, expectations for continued recovery and improved market backdrop for recycling, effective cost control and even better-than-expected integration synergies from the ADS acquisition, cash flow converges conversion is strong. And as a result, we expect to increase cash allocated to shareholder returns from our initial plans. In closing, it is imperative that we thank the men and women across the Waste Management team for their tireless efforts to serve our customers and communities each day. Our strong results are a testament to their commitment, and we're excited about what we will achieve together over the remainder of the year. With that, Holly, let's open the line for questions. Holly? Yes. So, what we're looking at is what you saw in the first really strong performance on the yield side, translating into strength for the remainder of the year, and that really being the catalyst for the upside on the total of 4.5% or greater That being said, our initial outlook for volume was around 1.5% to 2%, and we're optimistic that we'll also be at the high end of that range. But outperformance to previous expectations at this point really is centered around strength in pricing and the outlook for continued strength over the rest of the year. It's really difficult to specifically point to volumes. But, what we looked at is basically a month-by-month view of our volume trends. And what we saw is a significant downward pressure in the month of February, some carryover of that into -- or recovery of that, I should say, in March, but we don't know how much was true recovery of volume lost in February versus just continued momentum as we see economic recovery from the pandemic. We certainly think that it's the latter. And we're optimistic that we'll continue to see growth based on what we are seeing in the month of April thus far. Yes. It's a great question, Tyler. I think way that we're thinking about it, and you highlighted ADS, we're thinking about ADS as being an important component to the overall collection and disposal business. And the collection and disposal business with ADS synergy capture is over half of the expected $100 million lift in EBITDA, with a lot of that coming from expectations for stronger pricing, expectations for strong cost discipline and then there's a big offset for the incentive compensation that we discussed. So, when you have about half of that related to strong solid waste, it's a really strong indication of the strength of those two indicators. Then, on the commodity side, we've got a combination of the recycling line of business and RINs. And on the recycling commodity piece, we have about $35 million there and about $20 million from RIN value. Yes. Not completely offset by incentive comp. It just takes away from the headline number for solid waste. The compensation impact right now, our estimate and this can change based on our performance, the compensation estimate is a total of about $25 million. And so, when you look at the solid waste piece, my comment was it's more than 50%. So, we take the $55 million from commodity, the $25 million offset from incentive compensation that gets you to $30 million. So, you've got about $70 million at solid waste. And it's a combination of synergy capture from the ADS business and the strong performance from legacy WM. That's exactly right. Is this the recovery of commercial collection that we talked about being at about 70% of the COVID losses? Is that what you're referring to, Michael? Yes. It's a great question. And I think we talked a great deal today about the biggest driver, and that's the labor cost part of the equation. We certainly think that the efforts that have been put forth by the team to manage overtime hours and get those impacts not just on the service side, but extended through on the repair and maintenance side have been a tremendous value. We want that to continue to be a lever that produces the strong operating margin for the business, and we're optimistic about that. But, we also know that there are flex points or breakpoints in the equation that happened when you add an additional route. And so, that's what we're watching as we move forward from here with the growing volume environment. Aside from labor, I think what's really important is that we can't forget that in our transfer and disposal cost and subcontractor costs, there's a lot of third-party labor costs built into those numbers as well. And so, the theme that Jim has pointed us to a number of times today about the labor pressure that exists across the board, that's something that we've seen in those costs and something we expect to continue into 2021. So, 45% contribution margin is what we've talked about. We're encouraged that we think that that holds, but we think that there could be upside from it. But, the labor piece of the equation is really going to be the piece we have to watch. Yes. So, the first priority is investing in the long-term growth of the business, and that's something that we talk a great deal about. Organic growth through focuses in recycling and renewable energy have been places that we've said. You could see some outpaced capital spending from us. So, the current guide for 2021 incorporates our expectations for the full year in those programs. We just have yet to determine how much we could accelerate spend in 2022 and 2023 to cover incremental investment that could be worthwhile in those spaces. I think, the rest of the allocation really comes down to shareholder returns, continuing to grow the dividend over the long term in that 45% to 50% range on a payout ratio basis, and we measure that on free cash flow. So, there's direct conversion from that free cash flow measure and the long-term incentive plan to award the dividend, which I think is a really strong indicator of how we think about the growth that can happen as we revisit that in the fourth quarter. Beyond that, the statement that we made about at least $1 billion of share buyback in 2021 is an indication that when we don't see M&A being the place that we will spend that available dollar free cash flow, there is tremendous flexibility to allocate incremental dollars to the shareholders through share buyback. M&A, Jim touched on that. We'll continue to be sure that we're mindful of the opportunities that exist there. And if we see opportunities to provide outpaced returns relative to our other opportunities, we'll be well-positioned to do that with a strong balance sheet that I mentioned. I would say that things are recovering as expected. From a cash flow perspective, the really strong result that we had in the current year has to do with the headwind that we experienced in the first quarter of 2020. In the first quarter of 2020, we were between $60 million and $80 million behind on cash flow because we saw our customers slow down their payments. We've seen really strong resilience from our customers, and I think our proactive steps to protect our customers, particularly small business through the pandemic has paid dividends in that regard. And so, I will say, we had really good results from a days sales outstanding and bad debt perspective in the first quarter, a little ahead of expectations, but all-in-all, I would say, more close to tracking than leading. What I mentioned earlier about the cost headwinds that we know are coming, they were particularly strong in the second quarter 2021 outlook. And so, our expectations currently are certainly that we could outperform on the margin side relative to where we stand today. But, to build it in before we've seen the volume acceleration we thought would be not necessarily prudent based on where we stand. And we knew that $100 million lift in EBITDA from just two months ago was a really strong indication of the strength of the overall business. So, is there upside, potentially that it would have to come from how we see the cost side of the equation flow through as we see volume returns. Yes. It's a great question, Michael. Those estimates are really difficult to predict. But, I would tell you, our math at this point tells us that it's around 6% volume in Q2 and then closer to the 1.5% to 2% in the back half of the year."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before reviewing the terrific operating results that we achieved in the first quarter, I want to provide an update on the integration of ADS. Over the last six months, we've made significant progress on combining the two businesses, and we've been able to accelerate some of our integration plans. The teams have worked tirelessly to make sure that this combination goes smoothly. And based on the success of the integration so far, we are increasing our synergy expectations to $150 million of total annual run rate synergies, $130 million coming from operating costs and SG&A savings and $20 million coming from capital savings. For 2021, we now expect synergies of between $75 million and $85 million, all coming from cost savings. With approximately $15 million of annualized synergies captured in 2020, we expect to exit 2021 on an annual run rate synergy level of around $100 million. The remaining $50 million is expected to be captured in 2022 and 2023 from a combination of operating costs, SG&A and capital expenditures. Now turning to our first quarter results. Organic revenue grew 2.1% as disciplined pricing and improved recycling results overcame modest volume declines. Pricing performance for the quarter was very solid with both, core price of 3.4%, and collection and disposal yield of 2.8%, outpacing our expectations. Notably, our commercial yield rebounded sequentially from 3.1% -- to 3.1% from 1.9% in the fourth quarter. As economic reopening progressed during the first quarter, collection and disposal volumes improved again sequentially to a decline of 2.3% from 2.7% in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter, net new business turned positive, churn improved meaningfully to 8.2% and service increases expanded. While volumes have recovered meaningfully from the second quarter of 2020, collection and disposal -- from the second quarter 2020 collection and disposal decline of 10.9%. As Jim pointed out, WM is positioned to benefit from further improvements in North American economies. For example, at the end of the first quarter, we have recovered about 72% of the commercial yards lost due to COVID, providing room for considerable improvement in commercial volumes as we progress through the year. Similarly, our other highest-margin businesses, industrial and landfill have volume upside opportunity as visibility into the economic reopening continues to improve and more event work is scheduled and completed. Looking at the lines of business, we're making improvements with the help of a very deliberate pricing focus, residential landfill and recycling, I'm happy to report that we have had standout in each of these areas during the quarter. Residential yield doubled year-over-year to 4.2% as we make strides to improve the profitability in this line of business. This is the highest residential yield we have achieved since 2008 and it showcases our success in demonstrating the value of our service and pricing it appropriately. The increased yield drove operating EBITDA margins in the residential line of business to the highest level in the past 12 months despite still elevated residential container rates. Landfill core price was 3.2%, a strong result when you consider the impact of lower volumes related both to the pandemic and severe winter weather. In recycling, operating EBITDA doubled year-over-year to achieve earnings that rank in our top five best quarters ever. These results are truly a reflection of our work to improve the business model while creating a sustainable solution for our customers and not simply the result of an increase in recycled commodity prices. While our other top recycling quarters had an average commodity price of $127 per ton, we achieved our strong first quarter results with a price of $79 per ton. Finally, turning to costs. First quarter operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 130 basis points to 61.1%, demonstrating that we are maintaining our cost discipline as volumes recover. In the first quarter, we saw a 40 basis-point improvement in our labor costs as we continue to manage overtime spending. We also saw efficiency improvements in both the commercial and industrial lines of business, which we were able to identify and capture as our investments in technology help make us nimbler. In closing, I want to thank the waste management team for the exceptional job they have done in managing our operations to position us for success in 2021. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Jerry, I would add one thing here, too, which is about adding back labor. I mean, there's a couple of dynamics here. One is that pretty much all U.S. companies are facing, large or small, is this temporary competition against the government for unemployment benefits, and that is having an impact on us. The good news for us is that we didn't lay people off from COVID. So, if you did, and you're trying to rehire right now, you're having a tough time. And we -- as you may recall, we guaranteed 40 hours last year when we first hit and said, you're not going to lose your job because of COVID. So, that did help us. Not sure that we expected this unemployment benefit to continue as it has, but it did help us. I think, the other aspect of this is that we recognize that labor inflation is going to be around. It's been 5%ish for our nonexempt for a couple of years now. But we didn't anticipate this new competitor being the government. We think that's temporary. Right now, I think it's scheduled to -- these unemployment benefits are schedules go at the end of July. They may get extended with the new package through September. But, we'll use pricing from a kind of a macroeconomic standpoint to make sure that we manage volume. We don't need to take all new volume coming. We'll take the best of the new volume, and we'll manage accordingly, John and his team will through the labor line by using price to maybe tamp down some of that volume if we need to. Yes. Tyler, on the recycling, I'm assuming -- I presume that's what you meant. So yes, I mean you saw some of that in my prepared comments about an average rate in Q1 of 79 versus historical high averages in the mid to high-120s. And as I also mentioned, we've doubled the EBITDA quarter-over-quarter for the year. So, we're very happy there. To answer your question specifically, I would say it's about 23% to 25% of that move or $23 million on $10, if you want to look at it that way. What I would caution you by saying that, and I've made this comment on a number of these calls, again, that math is correct. It doesn't slide up and down the same way as it used to because again, we've put floors in place from an inbound customer standpoint. We've got better and secured outlets on the outbound side. I mean, we're seeing strong domestic and export markets right now, which is really helping us, on the outbound pricing side, and we've got more security around some of those rates. So, the math I gave you is right at a point in time if commodity price went way far south, which we don't expect, we expect them to stay hanging there for the next handful of years. That math would change. But about $23 million for that $10 move is where we're at for Q1. Yes. That's fair, Michael. I think, what we've also learned through this is that as the volume really kind of the tide went out on volume, I think the team did really a good job from an asset utilization standpoint. And what we've learned is, is that we can see some efficiency gains to be made by shortening of the work week, if you will, from 5 or 6 days to 4 or 5 days. And we worked pretty hard through the pandemic to make sure we flex down. And I think that's what you see in our efficiency numbers, our asset utilization numbers, our labor numbers. And then, as we flex back up to your point, I mean, there's going to reach a point where we theoretically have to add another truck. But, to my earlier comments because we created that capacity, we feel we've got some leverage certainly throughout this year to be able to take on those additional volumes without real big incremental costs. Yes. Okay. So, at the end of last year or in fourth quarter, you gave us a number of -- the total number of customers that weren't open yet at the end of the calendar year. Where does that number stand today? I think it's a combination, Mike, a couple of numbers. I mean service increases outpacing decreases. That's been the case for a while, but it's -- the gap is actually widening. So, you can argue about what that points do. But overall, we've seen a good trend there. And the churn number, we always talked about what was structural out at churn number. We were at 8.2% for the quarter, down from 9% and change. So, we view that obviously as a good indicator. And then, to my points earlier, Michael, about buying in particular on commercial, it's hard to look at the January -- excuse me, the Q1 this year versus last year. But sequentially, when you look at Q4, and then I pan across January, February, certainly not strong months, partly weather, partly all the other stuff we've mentioned. But then I look at March and what the trends are into April and small containers, and we're certainly encouraged there as well. Yes. Kevin, on the third-party front, I'm sure there's plenty of dollars out there that are looking for a place to park in this space. But, I think what's important is that the ones -- the four or five plants we have either in operation or that we've invested in, are showing some really strong results, and we're going to continue to look at those opportunities. I think, Devina said, how we finance is a different question. We have the balance sheet to be able to do that. We've got a fleet of 130 or so plants, so handful of those are the RNG plants. As Jim mentioned, we're closing the loop and fueling over half our fleet with renewable natural gas, which we think long term, that is a great solution for us. And we've clearly got some runway to go before we even consume all of our capabilities to fuel our own fleet. We're happy with the space and the investments we have for sure. Well, certainly, you've heard us talk in the last few quarters, the integration has kicked off and has gone well. A lot of the elements of the integration risks seem to be going better than expected. We talked about data migration being kind of long pole, last long pole in the tent. That's coming along nicely as we're that information over to our system. That's important now because in order to get the routing synergies around consolidations, we need to have all the information in one database. But specifically to your question, I mean, a public, public deal, we didn't -- you don't get the same look under the hoods maybe with a private deal. And once we dig it under the hood, what we found is, is that the areas that are impacted are finding out that they can operate the business more efficiently than we even thought going into it. Secondly, I think on internalization and transportation synergies is another bucket where again, once we got a look at some of that detail, we were able to drive out additional synergies. And then, lastly, really on the supply chain side, even though we're facing a couple of headwinds on some commodity-related pieces, our supply chain group, once they got to look at the whole portfolio of spend there has also been able to drive some additional benefit. So, it's really efficiency in the business in the field is the internalization, the transportation and disposal internalization. And then, lastly, it's really some of the corporate synergies around supply chain. Those are the three big buckets."

Now, I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2022 was another very successful year at WM. Coming into an uncertain 2022, I wouldn't have predicted that we would grow adjusted operating EBITDA by more than 9.5% for the year, and 8.8% for the fourth quarter, all while recycling was down $59 million for the year on a sharp drop in commodity prices. That's exactly what happened. Strong operational execution and an unwavering commitment to our strategic priorities led to our full year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of $480 million. We achieved this tremendous growth in the face of elevated inflation, a tight labor market, and a downturn in the recycled commodity price market. So, we're very proud of our results. Our robust operating EBITDA translated into record cash from operations of more than $4.5 billion, which allowed us to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As 2023 kicks off, we're confident that our long-term focus is on sustainable growth, transforming our business through technology and automation are setting us up to meet the changing needs of our customers, our people, and our business environment, while leveraging our competitive advantages. Turning to our high-level outlook for 2023. We expect to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA of between $5.825 billion and $5.975 billion in the year ahead, representing growth of just over 7% at the midpoint, which continues the trend of robust operating EBITDA growth that we've delivered since 2019. Since then, we've grown operating EBITDA almost 26%. And at a time when the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain, we're pleased to be anticipating another strong year of earnings growth in 2023. The essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base, and recurring revenue streams provide stability in times of economic uncertainty. Much of the growth in our 2023 outlook comes from deliberate steps that we've already taken to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs. Overall, we're anticipating between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion in the year ahead, driven by our collection and disposal business. Moving now to our sustainability growth investment. Let me give you an abbreviated overview of the supplemental deck that was posted to our Investors website. The investment in our renewable energy business is a unique opportunity that we simply couldn't afford to mass. You're all aware that since the passage of the subtitle B and associated air quality regulations in the 1980s and 1990s, landfill has been required to install gas collection systems. Historically, we've been collecting our landfill gas, converting much of it into electricity, which provides an earnings stream for us. Fast forward to present day, with landfill gas designated as a renewable resource, we are increasing the value of the gas that's an inevitable byproduct of most landfills. These RNG plants are simply taking gas that's naturally produced from the landfill and converting it into a cash-generating machine with a three-year projected payback and a far better environmental outcome than the status quo. And our returns far surpass those of our competition by virtue of our CNG fleet, which today represents 74% of our routed vehicles. As a result, we're better positioned to close the loop and capture extremely valuable regulatory RIN credits. At the same time, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will provide tax credits and benefits that served to amplify the value creation of WM's renewable energy business. The supplemental presentation to the earnings press release provides details on the investments and our projections for cash flow and operating EBITDA growth. But suffice it to say, we view this as a very strong positive for shareholders. We have a number of attractive options for our renewable energy portfolio. Internally, we said there are three possible outcomes from this opportunity, good, really good or great. And we're heading down the great path by owning the landfill gas and renewable energy facilities, generating RINs through our CNG fleet and maximizing the value of new tax benefits to increase the resulting earnings and cash flows. We're also advancing our planned recycling investments and have provided more details in the supplemental presentation on our website. Our portfolio of projects to automate existing and build new material recovery facilities have three key financial benefits; reduced labor costs, improved product quality that commands a price premium and capacity growth. In the fourth quarter, labor costs per ton at our single-stream automated MRFs improved by 35%. The automation of these plants enabled us to reduce 137 positions through attrition in 2022. And in 2023, we expect to reduce labor dependence by another 200 positions. By the end of 2023, we're anticipating about a 15% increase in processing capacity from our automated facilities and new markets. We will host a virtual information session for investors on April 5th to provide even more insight into our recycling and renewable energy growth plans. Devina will discuss our 2023 capital allocation plans in more detail, but I want to emphasize our confidence in our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities, including investing in these high-return sustainability growth projects, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and acquiring accretive businesses. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another fantastic year. We look forward to 2023 as we continue to execute on our operating plans and progress our investments in renewable energy, recycling and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Jim described our fantastic results in 2022 and that all begins with our collection and disposal business. In the face of some of the highest inflationary cost pressures, our collection and disposal business delivered double-digit in adjusted EBITDA for the full year. During the fourth quarter, collection and disposal results were even more impressive as adjusted operating EBITDA grew more than 11% and margin expanded 40 basis points. This momentum sets the stage for continued growth in 2023 and strengthens our conviction that the investments we're making in our people in automation and in differentiating our service offerings are the right decisions. The growth in our collection and disposal business starts at the top of the income statement with robust organic revenue growth. Full year core price was 7.8% with collection and disposal yield of 6.7% and volume of 1.8%. As we work to keep pace with decades high inflation, our revenue management teams delivered record core price in 2022 in every one of our lines of business, led by 10.5% in our commercial line of business. We talk often about our focus on generating appropriate returns in our residential and post-collection lines of business. And in 2022, we delivered core price of 6.5% in the residential line of business, 6.4% at our landfills and 5.9% at our transfer stations. Our revenue metrics demonstrate that our customers' receptivity to our pricing remained favorable through the fourth quarter. Our rollback percentage was almost 400 basis points better for the full year, while new business pricing increased more than 6% in our commercial line of business. The results clearly demonstrate our ability to manage cost pressures through continued pricing discipline and momentum, while maintaining our focus on customer lifetime value. As we move into 2023, our disciplined pricing programs combined with the strong momentum from 2022 and are expected to deliver core price of between 6.5% and 7% with yield approaching 5.5%. Our expectation is for strong rollover of 2022 price performance. Given the acute inflationary environment in 2022, we increased certain fees that we don't expect to step up again at the same level. We remain committed to securing pricing that outpaces our cost inflation, which is demonstrated by the operating EBITDA margin expansion that we're anticipating in 2023. Shifting to volumes. In the fourth quarter, event-driven volumes remained strong with special waste and C&D volumes growing double digits. Our commercial and industrial volumes were positive for the full year. However, we saw some softening in the fourth quarter. Given these recent trends, we are tempering our volume expectations in the year ahead. Our guidance includes 2023 collection and disposal volumes that are relatively flat with 2022. We continue to see the rate of labor increases easing in our business, and we remain focused on managing our operating expenses and flexing down costs, flexing costs down with the changing volumes. In our collection and disposal business, we are seeing improvements in our labor costs as inflationary wage pressures are easing. Turnover trends are improving and the investments that we are making in automation are showing benefits. These improvements were on display in the fourth quarter \u2013 in our fourth quarter results as we saw operating expense margin improved by 30 basis points despite still stubbornly higher maintenance and repair costs. For the full year of 2022, operating expenses increased 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue, but that was largely driven by negative impacts from higher fuel costs and recycling commodity prices that together impacted the measure by 80 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower labor and related benefits costs in our collection and disposal business and improved risk management costs. Putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect 2023 operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve between 30 and 50 basis points for the full year, with those improvements beginning in the second quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter, our recycling operating EBITDA remained solidly positive even with the sharp decline in commodity prices to about $47 per ton. Over the last several years, we have intentionally taken steps to shift the business to a fee-for-service model that has reduced our sensitivity to commodity market changes. When we started this journey in 2017, commodity prices were 60% higher than what we are anticipating in our 2023 outlook, yet 2023 operating EBITDA is expected to be about 13% higher than in 2017. This clearly demonstrates that our business model is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. As we look to the future of recycling, we remain focused on advancing automation across our MRF network, which we have proven can lower the cost of process material, achieve better quality while enhancing recycling profitability. Our employees delivered strong results in 2022, and I want to thank the entire WM team for their commitment to providing the best customer service while focusing on improving our operations. The team has done an exceptional job, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2022 financial results and 2023 financial outlook in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Once again, our solid waste business was at the center of WM's strong quarterly results, capping off a great 2022. Our team delivered strong organic revenue growth with a diligent focus on leveraging core price to offset cost inflation, while prioritizing customer service and customer lifetime value to minimize customer churn, all resulting in record high yield. When combined with strong cost control, these efforts delivered an 80 basis point expansion of operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved these excellent results while investing in technology and sustainability growth that will benefit WM for years to come. Full year adjusted SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, a 40 basis point improvement over 2021 as we achieved back-office operational efficiencies through standardization and process improvement that enabled us to reduce more than 600 positions through attrition. You can clearly see our strong performance and the record cash flow from operations that we achieved in 2022, which grew 4.6% to $4.536 billion. The increase in cash allowed us to accelerate investments at year-end, which brought full year capital spending to the high end of our expectations. 2022 capital expenditures totaled $2.587 billion with $2.26 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $561 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Putting these pieces together, 2022 free cash flow was $1.976 billion despite an increase in cash taxes of $370 million. During 2022, we returned a record $2.58 billion to shareholders, paying $1.08 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.5 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $377 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability and growth investments and achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth through capital investments in our business or strategic acquisitions. Moving to our 2023 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth approaching 5.5% from yield. Given an expectation for a little more than 1% revenue growth from acquisitions, and a decrease in revenue contributions from recycled commodity sales and fuel surcharges, we anticipate total revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5%. When combining our plan to deliver strong organic revenue growth with a focus on optimization and cost control to drive 40 to 80 basis points of operating leverage, we expect to generate adjusted operating EBITDA of $5.825 billion to $5.975 billion in 2023. We expect to allocate $1.1 billion to capital investments in recycling and renewable natural gas growth projects in the coming year and 2023 is expected to be the peak investment year for each business. While these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures, and therefore, reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. We view these investments as better than an acquisition dollar as they will produce even higher return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. Our normal course capital to support our business is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion in 2023. And free cash flow is projected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, including the impact of sustainability growth investments. Our outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $175 million to $215 million and about an $80 million headwind from working capital due in large part to the timing and amount of incentive compensation payments. As Jim discussed, even as we step up our investment in high-return recycling and renewable energy growth projects, we remain well positioned to allocate our cash among all of our capital allocation priorities, including returning cash to our shareholders. Given the Board of Directors intended 7.7% increase in the 2023 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.1 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2023, as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2022, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2023 and future years. I want to thank our hard-working team members for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Josh, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your may proceed.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Good morning, everyone.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering, if you could just talk about the puts and takes around the guidance. If recycled commodity prices remain tough over the year. That should be about a $ 50 million drag to EBITDA, give or take. And in that scenario, I'm wondering if we should be thinking about yield that's above the 5.5% target that we're laying out here this morning as we think about the potential for the yield number to move higher over the year as we've seen over the past couple of years?\nJim Fish: Jerry, let me tackle the first question first on recycling, and then I'll touch on yield overall. Recycling, obviously, fell off the table there at the end of the year. I think a lot of it had to do with China itself, even though China isn't a big customer of ours anymore, they still affect the overall market, particularly when we think about OCC. And their zero COVID policy certainly destabilize the market. I think as they've reopened, we've started to see some stabilization there. So that should help, and that's part of why we are a bit more optimistic in '23 with pricing starting to climb back up. It did climb up a bit in December, and we think it will continue to climb, albeit not back up to where it was for the year in 2022. To your question about yield in general and 5.5%, yield is doing exactly what we thought it would do. It's doing exactly what we said it would do last year. I kind of felt like we yield and cost, we're in a fistfight for the last 18 months with really no winter. And what we said was that we hope that when inflation moderated, which it is, that we would start to be able to use yield to not only cover costs, but also put a few points on the board in terms of margin. And that's exactly what's happening. So, we think that 5.5% yield number is absolutely the right direction. We're sensitive to customers. I mean, some of our yield numbers last year were double digits. And when inflation comes back down to 4%, 4.5%, I don't expect to take commercial increases at the 11.5% range. So I think we're pleased with the projection, and we're pleased actually with the fact that costs are starting to moderate and we can actually apply a little bit of our yield to the margin line.\nJerry Revich: Super. And Jim, maybe just to expand on that last point, given the margin cadence over the course of the year to get the margin expansion that you're targeting for 2023, it looks like you're going to be exiting the year with margins up maybe closer to 100 basis points year-over-year in the fourth quarter, just given the seasonality and cadence. Can you just comment on that and whether that momentum could continue into early 2024?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, Jerry, I think that that overview that you provided is spot on in terms of how it is that we're looking at margin for the year ahead, 60 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint indicates our confidence that the momentum that we saw in the back half of 2022 should continue into 2023. We expect some of the margin pressure from the recycling part of the business to continue in the first half. So we are seeing strong fundamentals in the solid waste part of our business that should help to offset that as they did in Q4. That being said, some of the cost execution, we really are laser focused as a management team on what we're doing on the cost side of the business. And that's not just looking at inflation and responding to it but being proactive in terms of what we can do to manage it appropriately. And truck delivery trends are favorable now relative to where we started 2022, and that should give us some relief both in repair and maintenance and in truck rental costs. Our frontline retention efforts are showing really strong benefits, and we expect that to continue in 2023. We're managing down professional fees, particularly in our SG&A. And then on the SG&A front, we're also leveraging technology to automate our processes, which is improving the customer experiences and reducing our cost to serve. So all of that gives us confidence that it's our strong execution on the cost side of the equation that will complement the yield that Jim just spoke to in terms of delivering that margin expansion and exiting 2023 with 100 basis points above kind of this current run rate feels like the right target for us.\nJerry Revich: Super, Devina. Thank you. And can I just sneak one more in. I really appreciate the landfill gas disclosures. I'm wondering, Tara and team, can you just give us an update on Offtake Agreements. A quarter ago, you were at one-third of your Offtake Agreements were done. Can you just give us an update on where that stands today and whether the pricing point on Offtakes in the market is still in the 20s or if that's come in, given the pullback in Henry Hub gas. Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So Jerry, in 2022, we were at 30%, and we're projecting in 2023 to be at 40% of our Offtake in fixed. And I think what's important to note here is we really took a look at this back in early 2022, looking at the volume ramp of our R&D, and we were pretty intentional about thinking through how to tap into those voluntary markets. So those markets today, we're seeing them be quite robust. If you think about large public utilities and industrial end users. This is a great way for them to tap into a low-carbon fuel and we're not seeing any price back at the moment. We'll give a bit more detail in April on what it looks like longer term as well.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. Wanted to start out on renewable energy. Thanks for all the details in the supplemental presentation. I know you had previously talked about 2023 as an elevated year for investment. But it seems like maybe you decided to accelerate it and expand even more. So, I guess what sort of -- why is this the right time? And maybe just cadence of the investment during the year. And maybe just -- does this mean that M&A will be lower this year versus last year? Thanks.\nJim Fish: We didn't really give guidance on M&A. Historically, we've said $100 million to $200 million, so it's likely going to be kind of in that range. But the reason to your point that we've decided to accelerate some of this is just simply the opportunity itself. I mean I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but it really is part of our solid waste business. This is gas as a result of Subtitle V and Air Quality Regulations that's coming to us anyway. About half of that gas has been monetized over the last, I don't know, 20 years, but we still have half left and we're certainly not monetizing the full amount when you look at that deck, but that, that we are monetizing we're effectively paying kind of a three times multiple instead of what you might pay for an acquisition, which would be kind of eight to 12 times. So, that's why we're feeling so good about it. And we've modeled these at very conservative numbers. Right now, we're well above those. So, I think the opportunity just started to present itself through the designation of this gas as being renewable. The markets themselves opening up and now with an opportunity which Tara can go into about electricity. In those cases, we don't even have to add capital if we already have electric facilities generating facilities out there.\nTara Hemmer: The only other thing I would just add to what Jim said regarding the acceleration of the investment is the investment tax credit and the fact that, that is a really strong pathway for us to get some tax credits on our investments and there's a timeline associated with that. And we feel really positive about where we are in our ability to capture those tax credits. We've modeled about $300 million, which you see in the deck. Regarding our broader portfolio, I mean, this is one of the reasons why we talk about this opportunity being so great because we preserved so many options for WM because we own the gas. We own our projects. We announced 20 projects. There's a whole pipeline that can come after that. And then with the e-RINs [ph] pathway, if you look at our legacy landfill gas to electricity projects, we can create an earnings stream with no incremental capital, and that's not in our numbers today. So, that's upside long-term. So, we're really optimistic about what we have in front of us here.\nJim Fish: And one -- maybe one last point here that I did mention also, but I'll mention it again. That differentiates us from our competition, and that is that CNG fleet. I mean 74% of our fleet is CNG and the way RINs works is you have to burn the fuel before you can monetize the RIN and having a fleet that is three quarters natural gas gives us a potential stream there, earnings stream that our competition who might be at 15% to 30% CNG, they simply don't have that or at least don't have it to the same potential that we do.\nToni Kaplan: Super. And I wanted to ask about volume. You mentioned the softening in commercial and industrial in the fourth quarter. Maybe just a little bit more color there, the magnitude, how quickly how it -- like was it early in the quarter or throughout the whole quarter, et cetera? And if you're expecting any softer volumes in the remainder of the business implied in the guide? Thanks.\nJim Fish: There were a few moving parts in the volume that was down slightly for Q4. Some of it was by design, residential specifically. Some of it was a couple of lost contracts in the commercial line of business and that was typically going to be in our national accounts group. And then, some of it is maybe softness showing up in the roll-off line of business. I guess, if there's any good news there, and it is that when we just looked at our January numbers this morning, they were actually better than Q4 on the volume front, particularly C&D, although some of that C&D might be coming from the hurricane cleanup in Florida. But MSW was a positive sign for January. So even with that, we felt that a negative 0.5% to a positive 0.5%. So a flat volume with last year, as John mentioned, was appropriate. And I guess, as we look at the tea leaves for the economy -- there are a few factors that are concerning out there; the housing slowdown, for sure. I mean, that's been widely discussed and that housing slowdown. While our C&D volume has been very good and continues to be good. We think that C&D will come back a bit. It almost has to with the housing slowdown. Special waste continues to be a strong point for us and the pipeline is good there. But I think as you think about, whether it's the housing slowdown or whether you think about the consumers saving at 7% in 2020 and now down to almost zero, because inflation has eaten up that savings. That's going to affect the consumer. But the good news for us is that our strategy is really not built around the volume aspect. It's built around cost controls, it's built around building out this sustainability strategy, and it's built around pricing. And so, we're pleased with being able to come in at the top end of the range on EBITDA at 7% for 2023.\nToni Kaplan: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. You may proceed.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJim Fish: Good morning.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Jim. Thank you for the supplemental deck. But I do kind of want to get to the heart of it. So is the idea here that the contribution in 2026 between RNG and recycling, maybe it's now expected to be $740 million, I think, if my math is right, and that was upsized, is that right?\nDevina Rankin: That's correct.\nJim Fish: Yes.\nTyler Brown: Okay. But you're also in the midst of a labor automation effort. And I just want to make sure that I'm not double counting, because some of that is probably in recycling. But how much additional EBITDA are you expecting by 2026 from that effort as well?\nJim Fish: So there is a bit of the -- when we automate in the recycling piece in the deck, there is a bit of that in the $260 million, I think, was the number, but...\nDevina Rankin: Yes, there's $70 million in the deck on\u2026\nJim Fish: But there are other areas where we're automating away positions and that are not captured in that deck at all, that really have nothing to do with RNG or recycling.\nTyler Brown : Yes. That's my point. Can you quantify that piece?\nDevina Rankin: Tyler, I would tell you that it's too early for us to predict the impact of that to 2026 and beyond. What we're really emphasizing in our 2023 outlook is that we're starting to see some of the benefits. Yes, recycling is a piece of that. But beyond the recycling line of business, we're seeing back office to 600 headcount attrition that I mentioned in customer experience, specifically is a strong example of that. And the leverage we've gotten in SG&A margin is in large part due to some of that success. So the 40 to 80 basis points of margin expansion really is all solid waste. And so that strong performance in 2023 is an indicator of future value that we think will come as we start to see, in particular optimization efforts in the collection line of business take hold. Some of that is delayed because of truck deliveries as well as some of our efforts to take that across additional lines of business. We started in the industrial line of business intentionally, and we're seeing strong success in some of those pilots. And we're happy with where we are, but too early for us to predict how much efficiency gain we can get across all lines of business in 2020 and beyond. But I think taking the 40 to 80 basis points accomplished or predicted for 2023 is a strong indicator of the strength of those initiatives.\nJim Fish : Tyler, let me expand so quick on what she just said about the 600 position, because that will become close to 1,000 positions just in customer experience. And we've talked a lot over the last couple of years about automation. But we haven't really given you kind of the numbers and where it's benefiting the bottom line. This is a good example. I mean, what we really did there was used a turnover number that was close to 50%. And customer experience, took advantage of that attrition. And at the same time, we automated the customer experience, which every other industry, by the way, has done over the last 20 years, and we hadn't. It was -- ours was still kind of a person-to-person experience. We haven't eliminated the person-to-person experience, but we've just made it available, made a self-service option available to our customers. And as a result, our call volume is down close to 25%. That's a huge drop in call volume. And hence, our ability to take advantage of attrition to the tune of 600 positions in 2022 and another close to 400 positions in 2023.\nTyler Brown : Okay. Yes, that's extremely helpful. A lot on to come there. Okay. Devina, kind of coming back to 2023 margins, though, and I don't want to be super -- I do want to be specific. Can you just talk about first half and second half margins? So are margins going to be a little bit more flattie in the first half and then up quite a bit in the second half? I just want to make sure that we all kind of get the shape of the year right and could margins actually be down in Q1 year-over-year?\nDevina Rankin: Margins could be backward in the first quarter of the year. The pressure from the recycling line of business is the most acute. And while drop in commodity prices is typically something that we see benefit our margin in that part of the business, because of the pass-through elements of some of it. We have seen some pressure. So we are predicting some flatness, I would say, in the first quarter, with expanding margin in the second quarter, particularly on the cost side of the business and starting to see the pricing parts of the business really contribute as they did in the second half of 2022, as we anniversary some of those impacts from the recycling line of business I mentioned. So first half, second half, I would say you'll see more muted margin expansion in the first half, stronger margin expansion in the back half. That being said, I wouldn't expect the minus 100, plus 100 that we saw in 2022 because we've overcome so many of the operating cost headwinds that we were experiencing this year and really starting to see some strong momentum there.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Perfect. That's extremely helpful. And my last one, just real quick, you kind of went through quite a bit on the free cash flow puts and takes. But can you kind of go back over what the expectation is year-over-year for cash taxes, cash interest and then maybe working capital? Just trying to help build that bridge.\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So EBITDA growth at the midpoint is $390 million, and so that will be the driver of free cash flow growth, cash flow from operations growth next year. Unfortunately, with this interest rate environment, we're going to have to give some of that back because our cost of debt is going up. As you can see, when you look at our fourth quarter results, our weighted average borrowing rate in the fourth quarter actually went up 80 basis points. And so that was an increase of $26 million in the quarter. We were virtually flat all year long in advance of Q4. And when we take that Q4 impact and extrapolate it to 2023, that's what's going to be driving our interest costs higher. So that in and of itself is a little over $100 million of impact. And then we do expect our debt balances to increase in the year ahead. Our debt balances are going to increase because we are seeing such strong growth, and we are going to be investing in all elements of capital allocation with that strong balance sheet. So not pulling back any on our allocation of cash to share buyback in the year ahead, is our current plan. We may moderate it some, but we'll give you more color on that over the course of the year. So with the higher debt balances and the higher interest cost that really is all of the $175 million to $215 million that I mentioned in interest and taxes. Taxes are actually going to be essentially flat. So while we would have expected some moderation in that, because of the one-time payment that I mentioned of $100 million, we're really seeing that offset by two things: one, higher pretax income; and the other being the expiration of a piece of bonus depreciation and the asset mix that we're putting in place. So those are the interest and tax pieces. The $80 million headwind I mentioned on working capital, we had an $88 million contribution to working capital in 2022. So we're essentially saying that, we think we might give some of that back. Some of that is a moderation in DSO, just because of the recessionary environment that we're predicting. But a large contributor is timing and amount of incentive compensation payments.\nTyler Brown: Very detailed as always. Thank you so much.\nDevina Rankin: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for question's. Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning. Thanks. D&A stepped up in 4Q. Can you first provide a little color on that and then give us what should be D&A for 2023?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So the color there is really inflation in our landfill costs. And it's both from normal inflationary cost pressures, as well as the regulatory environment, that's driving some of our costs for closure, post-closure higher. So the charge that we took in the fourth quarter relates predominantly to our closed site part of the portfolio, though some of it is also representative of changes we're seeing in management of the active landfills, too. In terms of next year's DD&A, we're not predicting another step change from this current level, but we are expecting DD&A levels to reflect better delivery of trucks in the year ahead. So you'll see some increased depreciation in the first half of the year rather than waiting to see all of that impact in Q4.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. But we could again be above that $2 billion number for 2023. So net-net D&A would step up year-over-year?\nDevina Rankin: Net-net G&A is going to be moderately higher just with the capital expenditure deliveries, but it's not going to be another step change from this level.\nNoah Kaye: Yeah. Okay. And then just on pricing, I guess, Jim, listening to your comments around some of the softening in the commercial sector. How do we think about the cadence of price growth expectations? It seems hard to sustain double digits in C&I as we go through the balance of the year. There is some math on that, of course. But how do we think about pricing? And what elements of the business may see the greatest sequential price declines on a cadence basis?\nJim Fish: Well, I think we think about it -- I mean, we're thinking about pricing because there are -- there's a two-fold exercise here. One is combating cost increases or inflation, which was why the last 18 months have been so challenging, because we really felt like it was almost all, in fact, in many cases, all of it was going towards combating inflation. And then a second piece is adding a few margin points for us. So as we look at this through our price group, particularly for commercial since that's where your question was, we think that pricing will moderate a bit, because inflation is moderating significantly. And that ends up being a good thing for us. If you look at collection and disposal yield for last year versus our guidance for this year, last year was $6.7 million this year guidance is 5.5%. So there is some moderation in yield there. But significantly, we're projecting at least a significantly different cost picture. So we think the price starts to contribute to margin again, whereas, it hasn't for the last probably three years.\nJohn Morris: I think the only one I would make there, Jim, is the residential line of business, specific if you look at our volume loss there, clearly, we continue to make deliberate decisions. We mentioned some of the franchises that we've parted ways with. And even if you look at the 4.5% or 4.7% negative volume, our revenue was still up over $50 million for the quarter in residential. And as we've said, we're going to continue down that path until we get acceptable returns and margins for that line of business. And so we're happy with that progress. We don't like intentionally shedding that business but under these conditions, like Jim said, the inflation is what we're combating and it's been most acute in residential, partly due to the labor intensity there.\nJim Fish: Yeah, I think maybe one place where it might not moderate as much is on the landfill side. I mean, we have a differentiated product there and so not that we don't have a differentiated product on the collection side, but landfill in particular, the yield was 6.2% MSW last year. I think that's probably the highest annual yield for MSW maybe in our history. And I don't expect that to come back to at a lot.\nNoah Kaye: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. You may proceed.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I understand free cash flow will get near-term. But do you think WM can emerge from this investment period with structurally higher free cash flow conversion from EBITDA than you had in 2021 and before, it seems like these investments will be highly cash generative once ramped and can potentially exceed where you were before the investment period.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, Brian, you're spot on there. Our ability to convert revenue and EBITDA dollars to free cash flow with the sustainability investments will be heightened as we come through the investment period. Fundamentally, that's because there's a different capital outlay model for this part of our business than there is for the collection and disposal business, where you're having to spend capital dollars effectively each day that you service the customer. So with maintenance capital levels meaningfully lower in both recycling and renewable energy, we're optimistic that cash flow conversion will be stronger after this investment period.\nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Thanks for that. And last question for me. The press release called out investment in plastic recycling infrastructure. Maybe just from a high level, is it possible to say what makes that such an enticing market for WM longer term, do you have any thoughts on how the margins or returns could compare to your existing business?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. The investment we made in Natura PCR, this is really about taking film and film plastic and mechanically recycling it. Film has very low recycling rates today. And on top of that, if you look at -- all of the brands out there, CPG companies have very strong commitments to use more recycled content products. So it's a market where there is a very strong need and we have a strong fit. Also, if you think about the plastics that we collect on the brokerage side of the house, so it felt like a natural fit for us. What you're seeing in the press release are some capital dollars to invest in building out that plant portfolio in Houston and also in the Midwest, and we'll be providing a bit more information on that in April.\nBryan Burgmeier: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll turn it over.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. You may proceed.\nKevin Chiang: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for the supplemental information here. If I look at your pro forma earnings contribution from these sustainability investments of -- and if I do kind of a quick back of the envelope math, it seems like you'd get to something like 15%, maybe even upwards of 20% of your earnings coming from recycling on RNG. And then the payback looks phenomenal. ROIC is obviously very big. But I guess how do you think about the underlying earnings volatility of the business now that it becomes more commodity exposed once these investments are completed?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, I can speak to the commodity volatility on both sides of the business. So on the RNG side of the house, we've talked a lot and I mentioned it today that we have 40% of our volume that's really tied into fixed price markets. And then we also have the ability on the transportation side of the house to leverage WM suit and tie it into ERINs [ph]. We're really -- sorry, RINs, conventional RINs, we're really being thoughtful about how our ramp looks long term and how to tap into those fixed versus transportation markets. And so we'll give a bit more information on that in April. But suffice it to say that, it's something that we're tracking very closely, and we have a whole host of options to ensure that we can navigate that. I think there's very strong fundamentals. If you look at what the EPA did with their announcement on the renewable volume obligation and setting a three-year pathway. So it really shores up where we're headed on the renewable natural gas side of the house. On the recycling side of the house, I think what's interesting is, if you look at the $240 million in EBITDA, 60% of that is really independent of commodity prices, and that really speaks to the fact that a big piece of it is coming from labor and labor improvements. 35% exiting the quarter in labor cost per ton improvements at our automated facilities. And then revenue quality, and a great example of that is how we're able to take mixed paper and remove cardboard from those bales and sell it at a higher price premium. And that's independent of market prices. So a lot of what we're doing will help us inflate ourselves from those wings.\nJim Fish: And I might add one thing because in your question about adding volatility, I mean, I guess you could say that. But look, as I said, and Tara has mentioned as well, this gas is coming to us regardless. I mean, this is gas that is produced by these landfills as a result of MSW going into them. And about half of it is monetized in some form today. All we're doing here is taking advantage of a situation that was presented to us, but also taking advantage of our natural gas fleet and turning that 50% that isn't monetized into some value add for shareholders. Does it add some volatility? I guess it adds some, although Tara has gone through a part of her answer to question earlier was to -- that we are looking to take some of that volatility away by fixing some of the pricing. But I think there's this view that why would you add a volatile business here? And the answer is, we're just taking gas that's being produced by these sites and turning it into a very, very profitable revenue stream with very, very strong paybacks.\nKevin Chiang: That's great color, Jim. That's very helpful. Maybe just my second one just maybe on some of the automation you were talking about on the customer service side. It sounds like, obviously, some huge wins there. Just wondering what you're seeing from -- I guess, the labor cost savings -- would you track, I guess, like a Net Promoter Score or like a customer churn, as you roll that technology out and maybe do some of the friction that some of your customers might have had calling into call centers. Are you seeing other benefits, whether something that promoter score or churn rate that you'd be tracking alongside just the labor cost savings?\nJohn Morris: Yes, that's a good question. A few things are happening on that front. One is we've digitized a lot of the customer-facing elements of sort of these transactions. So customers have the better ability to transact with us when and how they want to from a digital perspective. We're seeing that translate to NPS scores, not a surprise that we in the beginning of the year had some dips in our NPS scores as we were challenged on some of the labor and asset fronts that Devina and Jim commented on, but that started to improve in the second half of the year, which has also helped our service quality. So, we're seeing our NPS score start to move the right way in the back half of the year. And we're also, at the same time, seeing the benefits from some of the labor arbitrage. As Jim mentioned, these are not jobs we're moving out. These are jobs that we're not replacing because they're because they're high turnover. And I think Tara and Jim gave good color on what's happening with the recycling and the recycling front with respect to automation benefits. And we've touched on the other big bucket is moving from sort of the traditional manual rear load system to the ASL system, that's another element of automation where we're clearly seeing benefits.\nKevin Chiang: Excellent. That\u2019s it from me. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much Jim. And just following up on Kevin's question there regarding -- and to your point, Jim, it is fluctuation, but it's something that can be managed and it looks like you're doing you're setting up for a great job managing some of that fluctuation. But I guess investors are -- and you touched on it on your pricing, right? In the solid waste sector, investors are accustomed to price never going down. Yes, it might go up less and the volatility is really just how much more does it go up one year to the next. But with some of the renewable energy fluctuations and recycled commodity prices as you pointed out. I mean, you're getting EBITDA going down this year as a result of those. My question, I guess, is that as you build these out more, is this something that you would you would consider spinning off while retaining a stake as to kind of separate the two so that investors who desire that volatility, want that volatility and willing to pay for the volatility can do so and then those that are -- prefer the more steady EBITDA stream that your company has delivered so well in the past, can focus more on. Is that something that is in the cards in the future? How much have you thought about it? Just curious in that regard?\nJim Fish: Well, a couple -- I think you're making a couple of points here. Just to maybe correct one thing. Price isn't going down if that's what you were implying. It's not going down. It's just going up by slightly less than it did last year. And to your question about whether we would consider spinning off the RNG business. I mean, first of all, there's a lot of options for us and we would never take any options off the table. But what Tara said earlier, which I think is important is we -- part of the value for us is that we like owning the gas, we like owning the facilities. And so for the time being, the answer is we're going to develop these ourselves. We're going to -- and we're going to see the full benefits come to ourselves. And we'll do everything we can to try and mitigate the volatility -- but we like owning the gas itself. We like being in a position -- I've been in a position in the field where I managed the landfill where we didn't own the well field. And that was not a great position to be in, having been there a number of years ago. So, we like being in a position where we manage the well fields that produce the gas. Not to say we wouldn't consider that down the road. But for now, we're kind of in our infancy and we're going to own and develop on our own for now.\nJohn Morris: I think Jim --\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. That was my only question. Thanks very much.\nJim Fish: Yes.\nJohn Morris: I was just going to add on the recycling side. If you look at that separately from the RNG comments you made, if you went back five or six years ago and looked at the commodity price versus what their earnings stream was out of the recycling facilities was much different. But in my prepared comments, you earn at $47 a ton. We're still seeing strong earnings and returns in our -- in all of our MRFs, not to mention the fact that when you were to carve out the automated plants, which is only a small portion, we're going to add to that next year, as Tara mentioned, those margins are even higher. So I would argue that we've taken out a lot of the volatility in the recycling business, and that's why you continue to see our conviction in those investments going forward.\nJim Fish: Yes, I'm glad you made that point, John, because we did change a lot of these contracts from four years ago, and I think that's your point.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes. No, that's absolutely -- that's clear that you've done a lot of good work in terms of restructuring those contracts to produce some of that volatility. Just curious in terms of the spinout, but addressed that question. Appreciate the time.\nJim Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nSean Eastman: Hi, team. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I just wanted to reconcile the -- there was a 35% labor costs per ton reduction on the recycling footprint mentioned, also a headcount reduction of, I think, 127. Just trying to reconcile those two data points.\nTara Hemmer: Yes. So John mentioned in his remarks, the 35% reduction on our automated plants on labor cost per ton, and that's what we saw in Q4. And then that 137 number is related to the headcount attrition related to automation in 2022, and we're expecting 200 in 2023.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Helpful. It's impressive. And then, the other one is just kind of nitpicking here, but the some of the inputs on the guidance for this year, $70 OCC, $2.30 RIN price. Could you just tell me where those numbers are today? And if you can, just how to think about sensitivity to the extent we don't climb up to those numbers?\nTara Hemmer: Yes. So just to clarify, it's $70 per ton in our commodity basket, not on OCC, just to -- \nSean Eastman: Okay. Yes.\nTara Hemmer: Yes. So $70 a ton number for 2023, exiting December of this year, just north of $50 a ton. And we're seeing some signs on the plastic side, is a great example, where we're seeing plastic pricing increase a bit. And we've seen that uptick related to, again, CPG companies trying to meet their sustainability commitments on using recycled content. So we expect, if you look at that ramp through Q1, Q2, Q3, we'll start to see that ramp over the quarters when you look at how commodity prices will move on the recycling side of the business. And then, on the renewable energy side of the house, that $2.30 RIN price, exiting 2022, RIN prices were higher. We've seen a bit of a dip on RIN pricing that definitely recognizes what we're seeing in the market today and where we expect it will hedge throughout 2023. Just remember, 40% of our off-take is fixed. So the other 60% is exposed.\nDevina Rankin: And I would just say the midpoint of our guidance anticipated the commodity values that Terra just went through, the downside has contemplated some of the downside risk should those values be less than what we are currently predicting.\nSean Eastman: Understood. Thank you, very much. I\u2019ll pass it over.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. You may proceed.\nMichael Hoffman: Good morning. I just want to make sure this is very clear. You are not seeing unit prices come down, the rate of change in price is narrowing options coming down?\nJohn Morris: No, sir. Michael, no, we are not.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And you are in a position today where you have a real spread against the internal cost of inflation?\nJim Fish: Yeah. That was my earlier point.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay.\nJim Fish: This gives us \u2013 it gives us that spread. We had essentially no spread for the last 18 months.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. So then I want to dig into \u2013 I think there's more power in the solid waste business than maybe everybody's understanding. Are you about 80% of your EBITDA, 80%, 85% is solid waste and then 15 to 20 is sustainable investments in recycling. Is that about the right proportioning?\nDevina Rankin: The way that, I would answer the question, Michael, is if you look at our outlook for the year ahead, we're implying growth from the solid waste business of about $475 million and that rivals the highest levels of growth that we've ever seen in our history. And so what we focus on in terms of measuring solid waste performance is our ability to fundamentally grow that business over the long term, both in terms of the pricing execution and our strong focus on operating cost efficiency and those things are what are driving that $475 million target.\nJohn Morris: I would tell you, Michael, I think with Devina and I can share this \u2013 we all do on OpEx. But I think to Jim's point, we were kind of arm wrestling with it, I forget the phrase used, Jim. I think the efforts that we undertook last year and what happened in the last two quarters, in particular, the fourth quarter make us feel really good about what's happening on the solid waste side and some of the commentary was about price and yield and the movement. But when you see OpEx, our guidance on OpEx moving the way it is for next year and the EBITDA improvement in Devina said what the strength of the solid waste business is we feel really good about how we're entering 2023.\nMichael Hoffman: And I agree. I'm trying to get there by backing into numbers a little more precisely. That's why I was asking about the mix. If I'm right, and you're in the 80%, 85% is solid waste, you're going to end up with a 9% to 10% growth in solid waste in 2023 in EBITDA. And like 90 basis points, maybe even 100 basis points in the solid waste business and then you give a little bit of a back because of the other stuff, right?\nDevina Rankin: We are predicting that strong solid waste growth coupled with some SG&A margin expansion. Those are really the two levers for next year's overall EBITDA growth.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Okay. Well, I tried. I would \u2013 would you all consider starting to segment where you show us recurring core solid waste versus the alternatives? So we start to be able to track this better?\nDevina Rankin: We always focus on making sure that you guys have the best information available, and we'll continue to try and meet that goal, and we'll step back and look at our disclosures and ensure that they're appropriately robust. We think that they are today, but we know we can always get better.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Baseline capital spending at 2 to 2.1 comes out at 9.9% of revenues, which is below your long-term average. And it's a little surprising given the vendor side of the world is talking about a lot of inflation in their side of the business still. So I'm trying to understand why that baseline \u2013 and it's essentially flat, sequentially in absolute dollars. So what \u2013 I don't think you're under investing in your business. I know, you're not doing that. But can you talk me through why that's settling the way it is?\nJohn Morris: I think, Michael, if you look at the inflationary pressure and the performance on the revenue side related to that, we've been also very sensitive to the fact that capital shouldn't just necessarily go up because revenue is. We're looking at it by line of business and what's happened from a volume perspective. And I think that's what you're seeing part of the leverage there. On the supply side, Michael, I would tell you, this was a challenging year in terms of juggling CapEx mostly because of the truck-related issues that we had. So 2023 will be more balanced, but I think you're seeing the sub-10 number as a result of our discipline around capital dollars.\nDevina Rankin: The other thing I would point out is we did pull ahead some capital into the fourth quarter. And as a result of our ability to do that, we moderated our outlook for 2023 capital slightly from our original expectations. Should we see a need to adjust that further as we get into the year and perform well as we expect to do, particularly in the solid waste business, we might take some steps to accelerate capital that much further. But this is about strong execution on capital discipline, combined with our ability to ensure that our price isn't just addressing the operating cost side of the business, but also capital inflation.\nMichael Hoffman : Right. Last two for me. Tara, the $500 million of EBITDA in RNG in 2026, how much of it is fixed versus spot?\nTara Hemmer: Today, we have 40% fixed based on the roughly 4 million MMBtu, and so that is what is fixed today. We're working on fixing more of that longer-term.\nMichael Hoffman : But -- so you don't have a goal for that $500 million? I guess that's what I'm trying to ask. What how much of it.\nTara Hemmer: Yes. We have a goal. We'll give you more information on that in April, Michael. We have a pathway to have a portfolio mix longer-term.\nMichael Hoffman : And will you give a sales when you do it for\u2026\nTara Hemmer: We\u2019re going to unpack that in April.\nMichael Hoffman : And will you talk about sales in April as well, so we can model this, right?\nTara Hemmer: You're talking about revenue, yes, revenue on the RNG business.\nMichael Hoffman : Yes, yes. I mean in the supplemental document, we have the EBITDA and the free cash, but they don't have revenue. So we're all guessing what that means to our model.\nTara Hemmer: You can -- I think you could figure it out based on the $26 per MMBtu number we gave you.\nJim Fish : Suffice to say, it\u2019s the margins on this business, Michael, and whether you're looking at margins on the EBITDA side are 70%-ish maybe 75%. I mean, we'll get -- as she\u2019ll still give more detail on in April. And then as Devina went through, the cash conversion is tremendous, too. So it's why this business -- why we're so excited about it. And nobody has asked a question about M&A, but I did mention that I'd rather do a three times EBITDA investment than a 10 times EBITDA investment where there's some uncertainty about integration. So we'll talk about revenue and what it means. But these are hugely high margins on the EBITDA line with these RNG plants.\nMichael Hoffman : Last question for me. In 2019, you told us that the solid waste business would compound at 5% to 7% EBITDA free cash. When I add in the $740 million by 2026, will that new baseline still compounded by the aggregate number, 5% to 7%, or does that 10% increase dilute that compounding, the aggregate compounding?\nDevina Rankin: It's a great question, Michael. And what we're doing is working to segment these parts of the business very clearly so that we can articulate the level of growth that each of them is expected to have. The solid waste business has outperformed that 5% to 7% target that we established, and we couldn't be more proud of those results. In terms of what's happening in the RNG and recycling businesses, we're talking about a new step level change in our free cash flow generation for the business. Our ability to grow that, I think done a great job of articulating the fact that this opportunity and what's outlined in the supplemental deck is just a starting point for us. Our portfolio provides tremendous upside opportunity from here. Our ability to say whether that's 5% to 7% or some other number, that will come as we further articulate our plans for building out the total addressable market that we have across our landfill network.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. You may proceed.\nMichael Feniger: Thanks, everyone. I know we're over. So I'll just keep it short. Tara, apologies if you touched on this, but why has RINs rolled over in the beginning of this year? And any policy actions that we should be monitoring that helps get that RIN recovery to that 230 for the full year?\nTara Hemmer: Yeah. I think the important thing to remember here is that earlier in -- really in December of 2022, EPA came out with their that rule, which on the positive side, set a three-year framework for renewable volume obligations, which for us for the long-term is positive because at the end of the day, it really sets the standard for the program and the RIN pathway for us. I think there's been a little bit of speculation in the marketplace around whether or not those were the right numbers that EPA issued. We're confident that come June when EPA issues their final rule, there'll be more clarity. So I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing. But long-term, strong fundamentals on the price side related to RINs.\nMichael Feniger: Thank you. And just, Devina, the last four to five years, I think your EBITDA margins have been in the tight range of 28% to 28.4%. You are now guiding for 40 to 80 bps, so moving up there. Just can you quantify how much of a headwind is there on the margin for RNG and OCC in 2023 based on the guide?\nDevina Rankin: It's 10 to 20 basis points.\nMichael Feniger: Perfect. Okay. Thanks everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Thank you. We'll keep it brief. And, kind of, just a continuation of the last question. Just wanted to talk about what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint in your renewable energy business. I know that does include RINs, but it does include some other factors as well within your business. And then longer term, I know near-term, Devina, you just kind of discussed with the EPA standards and RIN pricing. But is there any kind of risk of maybe a supply-demand in balance with more supply at some point as more and more of certainly you guys but also your competitors also bring these renewable natural gas facilities online, just what that can mean for pricing, not necessarily this year or next, but longer term? Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Sure. I'll speak to the price side, and this is a footnote in our press release, but we did see pricing come down in the three categories, slight decline on the power side. And as you can imagine, we saw some record power prices related to some of the dynamics in 2022 related to weather and whatnot. So that's reflected on the power side. On the natural gas side, natural gas pricing has come down. We were north of $5 in 2022 and now coming in and around 360, that's what we're guiding to. And then on RIN prices, again, 230 is what we have in our guidance. And I think I just went over a little bit of the dynamics there. As far as the supply and demand dynamic, I think what's really important to note on the renewable natural gas side is there are two markets, and they're quite robust. The first is on the transportation side, which is where we generate D3 RINs. And for us, we're in a unique position. Jim has mentioned this before, where we own our own fleet, so we're able to capture more of the value, and we have robust discussions with obligated parties. So we're able to trade those RINs and have a long history with that. At the same time, you have this voluntary market that exists where many, many public utilities have come out with announcement where they need to decarbonize their own portfolios and the fastest way for them to do that is to buy renewable natural gas and buy renewable natural gas at a price premium. And again, we'll give you more information on this in April, but we feel really positive about the options that we have for each of those.\nStephanie Moore: Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. You may proceed.\nStephanie Yee: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to the 2023 guidance overall, and just ask whether you're assuming a recession in the guide or maybe just a slowing economic environment. And I guess you could probably see this most reflected in the volume guidance range. So is the low end of the range at kind of negative 1.5%, embed some conservatism on the economic environment.\nJim Fish: I wouldn't say that any of us are macroeconomists. So whether we're projecting a recession or not is hard to say. But we are projecting some softness for sure. We saw some softness in our volume numbers, as I mentioned, probably particularly in roll-off for Q4, and that's continued a bit in January, albeit -- our numbers were a little stronger volume-wise in January. I think if we try and read those tea leaves ourselves, and we're all reading as much information as we can, it feels like there could be some type of slowdown, especially as the consumer eats through all of their savings. But I am -- the last thing I am as a macro economist. So I can't sit here and tell you, yes, we're going to see a recession next year. We're just having to manage our business to \u2013 to our own best abilities. And that's why we have taken cost control on very seriously. That's why pricing is still an important aspect of this. And then at the same time, for the long-term, these renewable natural gas facilities and automation of a number of these positions makes a lot of sense. So that really is affected by \u2013 by any downturn in the economy.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Devin Dodge with BMO Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nDevin Dodge: Thanks. Good morning. I suspect we'll get more color on April 5, but could you provide a framework for how meaningful Erin could be from a WM perspective?\nTara Hemmer: So, the important thing to remember is it's a proposed rule and EPA will be coming out with our final framework sometime over the summer. I think from our perspective though, you got to look at the 66 landfill gas to electricity plants that we have, that we own. And this, we believe, will be a significant revenue stream for us long term. It's a great example of our ability, where we have owned these facilities and invested in them and retained the value. Now, we're in a position to optimize the value with this pathway. So, really waiting for a bit more color from EPA on what their final framework is going to look like, but really optimistic. Again, no incremental CapEx on that potential revenue stream.\nDevin Dodge: Good color. Okay. So maybe on the same thread, do you think, Erin's even could impact the development pipeline for landfill RNG projects, or do you still expect RNG to be the most desirable landfill gas project, assuming the site is suitable for it?\nTara Hemmer: Yes, great question. I think we're -- first and foremost, we're really confident on the path that we're on with the 20 projects that we have in the deck. And we're actively looking at our portfolio. We're going to make the best economic decision, the best environmental decision. And the good news is, we have a lot of options here. I mean, that's something that Jim said earlier on, good, really good or great. We view these frameworks as great for WM. So we're going to evaluate what makes the most sense for us long term.\nDevin Dodge: Okay. And then maybe just one kind of more detailed question. But in Q4, we saw that core price and yield in the collection and disposal business, they really converged, which is great. But it was a much tighter spread than we've seen in recent quarters. And then the 2023 guide suggested would widen back out again. Just can you provide some color on some of the factors that impacted that spread in Q4?.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question. And when we wish we had a specific science towards being able to predict the Q4 results were best ever in terms of the difference between core price and yield. And in large part, that speaks to the strong churn that John mentioned during his prepared remarks, the 400 basis point improvement there is a really strong indicator that price is holding with our customers and that we're doing -- I'm sorry, the comment was on robot on churn, but our churn has been really strong as well. And our ability to hold on to every core price dollar and convert that to yield really was the best we've ever seen. In terms of our ability to predict that we'd still see those levels in 2023, I think it actually goes back to Stephanie's question earlier about the macroeconomic outlook. We used our long-term averages of converting our core price dollar to yield, rather than the fourth quarter launch pad. Because we view the macroeconomic environment is a little more uncertain than it is today, though we are seeing those signs of self-antigen done a good job of articulating. We do think that all indicators point to a soft recession in '23, and we didn't want to overpredict our ability to convert core price to yield in the year ahead.\nDevin Dodge: Okay. Thanks, guys. Makes sense. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. And I\u2019m now showing any further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish for any closing remarks.\nJim Fish: Okay. Thank you. Well, we ran a bit long today, but we have a lot to cover. Thank you for your patience. Thanks for joining us and we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. 2022 was another very successful year at WM. Coming into an uncertain 2022, I wouldn't have predicted that we would grow adjusted operating EBITDA by more than 9.5% for the year, and 8.8% for the fourth quarter, all while recycling was down $59 million for the year on a sharp drop in commodity prices. That's exactly what happened. Strong operational execution and an unwavering commitment to our strategic priorities led to our full year adjusted operating EBITDA growth of $480 million. We achieved this tremendous growth in the face of elevated inflation, a tight labor market, and a downturn in the recycled commodity price market. So, we're very proud of our results. Our robust operating EBITDA translated into record cash from operations of more than $4.5 billion, which allowed us to return more than $2.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As 2023 kicks off, we're confident that our long-term focus is on sustainable growth, transforming our business through technology and automation are setting us up to meet the changing needs of our customers, our people, and our business environment, while leveraging our competitive advantages. Turning to our high-level outlook for 2023. We expect to deliver adjusted operating EBITDA of between $5.825 billion and $5.975 billion in the year ahead, representing growth of just over 7% at the midpoint, which continues the trend of robust operating EBITDA growth that we've delivered since 2019. Since then, we've grown operating EBITDA almost 26%. And at a time when the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain, we're pleased to be anticipating another strong year of earnings growth in 2023. The essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base, and recurring revenue streams provide stability in times of economic uncertainty. Much of the growth in our 2023 outlook comes from deliberate steps that we've already taken to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs. Overall, we're anticipating between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion in the year ahead, driven by our collection and disposal business. Moving now to our sustainability growth investment. Let me give you an abbreviated overview of the supplemental deck that was posted to our Investors website. The investment in our renewable energy business is a unique opportunity that we simply couldn't afford to mass. You're all aware that since the passage of the subtitle B and associated air quality regulations in the 1980s and 1990s, landfill has been required to install gas collection systems. Historically, we've been collecting our landfill gas, converting much of it into electricity, which provides an earnings stream for us. Fast forward to present day, with landfill gas designated as a renewable resource, we are increasing the value of the gas that's an inevitable byproduct of most landfills. These RNG plants are simply taking gas that's naturally produced from the landfill and converting it into a cash-generating machine with a three-year projected payback and a far better environmental outcome than the status quo. And our returns far surpass those of our competition by virtue of our CNG fleet, which today represents 74% of our routed vehicles. As a result, we're better positioned to close the loop and capture extremely valuable regulatory RIN credits. At the same time, the recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act will provide tax credits and benefits that served to amplify the value creation of WM's renewable energy business. The supplemental presentation to the earnings press release provides details on the investments and our projections for cash flow and operating EBITDA growth. But suffice it to say, we view this as a very strong positive for shareholders. We have a number of attractive options for our renewable energy portfolio. Internally, we said there are three possible outcomes from this opportunity, good, really good or great. And we're heading down the great path by owning the landfill gas and renewable energy facilities, generating RINs through our CNG fleet and maximizing the value of new tax benefits to increase the resulting earnings and cash flows. We're also advancing our planned recycling investments and have provided more details in the supplemental presentation on our website. Our portfolio of projects to automate existing and build new material recovery facilities have three key financial benefits; reduced labor costs, improved product quality that commands a price premium and capacity growth. In the fourth quarter, labor costs per ton at our single-stream automated MRFs improved by 35%. The automation of these plants enabled us to reduce 137 positions through attrition in 2022. And in 2023, we expect to reduce labor dependence by another 200 positions. By the end of 2023, we're anticipating about a 15% increase in processing capacity from our automated facilities and new markets. We will host a virtual information session for investors on April 5th to provide even more insight into our recycling and renewable energy growth plans. Devina will discuss our 2023 capital allocation plans in more detail, but I want to emphasize our confidence in our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities, including investing in these high-return sustainability growth projects, returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases and acquiring accretive businesses. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another fantastic year. We look forward to 2023 as we continue to execute on our operating plans and progress our investments in renewable energy, recycling and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results. Jerry, let me tackle the first question first on recycling, and then I'll touch on yield overall. Recycling, obviously, fell off the table there at the end of the year. I think a lot of it had to do with China itself, even though China isn't a big customer of ours anymore, they still affect the overall market, particularly when we think about OCC. And their zero COVID policy certainly destabilize the market. I think as they've reopened, we've started to see some stabilization there. So that should help, and that's part of why we are a bit more optimistic in '23 with pricing starting to climb back up. It did climb up a bit in December, and we think it will continue to climb, albeit not back up to where it was for the year in 2022. To your question about yield in general and 5.5%, yield is doing exactly what we thought it would do. It's doing exactly what we said it would do last year. I kind of felt like we yield and cost, we're in a fistfight for the last 18 months with really no winter. And what we said was that we hope that when inflation moderated, which it is, that we would start to be able to use yield to not only cover costs, but also put a few points on the board in terms of margin. And that's exactly what's happening. So, we think that 5.5% yield number is absolutely the right direction. We're sensitive to customers. I mean, some of our yield numbers last year were double digits. And when inflation comes back down to 4%, 4.5%, I don't expect to take commercial increases at the 11.5% range. So I think we're pleased with the projection, and we're pleased actually with the fact that costs are starting to moderate and we can actually apply a little bit of our yield to the margin line. We didn't really give guidance on M&A. Historically, we've said $100 million to $200 million, so it's likely going to be kind of in that range. But the reason to your point that we've decided to accelerate some of this is just simply the opportunity itself. I mean I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, but it really is part of our solid waste business. This is gas as a result of Subtitle V and Air Quality Regulations that's coming to us anyway. About half of that gas has been monetized over the last, I don't know, 20 years, but we still have half left and we're certainly not monetizing the full amount when you look at that deck, but that, that we are monetizing we're effectively paying kind of a three times multiple instead of what you might pay for an acquisition, which would be kind of eight to 12 times. So, that's why we're feeling so good about it. And we've modeled these at very conservative numbers. Right now, we're well above those. So, I think the opportunity just started to present itself through the designation of this gas as being renewable. The markets themselves opening up and now with an opportunity which Tara can go into about electricity. In those cases, we don't even have to add capital if we already have electric facilities generating facilities out there. And one -- maybe one last point here that I did mention also, but I'll mention it again. That differentiates us from our competition, and that is that CNG fleet. I mean 74% of our fleet is CNG and the way RINs works is you have to burn the fuel before you can monetize the RIN and having a fleet that is three quarters natural gas gives us a potential stream there, earnings stream that our competition who might be at 15% to 30% CNG, they simply don't have that or at least don't have it to the same potential that we do. There were a few moving parts in the volume that was down slightly for Q4. Some of it was by design, residential specifically. Some of it was a couple of lost contracts in the commercial line of business and that was typically going to be in our national accounts group. And then, some of it is maybe softness showing up in the roll-off line of business. I guess, if there's any good news there, and it is that when we just looked at our January numbers this morning, they were actually better than Q4 on the volume front, particularly C&D, although some of that C&D might be coming from the hurricane cleanup in Florida. But MSW was a positive sign for January. So even with that, we felt that a negative 0.5% to a positive 0.5%. So a flat volume with last year, as John mentioned, was appropriate. And I guess, as we look at the tea leaves for the economy -- there are a few factors that are concerning out there; the housing slowdown, for sure. I mean, that's been widely discussed and that housing slowdown. While our C&D volume has been very good and continues to be good. We think that C&D will come back a bit. It almost has to with the housing slowdown. Special waste continues to be a strong point for us and the pipeline is good there. But I think as you think about, whether it's the housing slowdown or whether you think about the consumers saving at 7% in 2020 and now down to almost zero, because inflation has eaten up that savings. That's going to affect the consumer. But the good news for us is that our strategy is really not built around the volume aspect. It's built around cost controls, it's built around building out this sustainability strategy, and it's built around pricing. And so, we're pleased with being able to come in at the top end of the range on EBITDA at 7% for 2023. Good morning. Yes. So there is a bit of the -- when we automate in the recycling piece in the deck, there is a bit of that in the $260 million, I think, was the number, but... But there are other areas where we're automating away positions and that are not captured in that deck at all, that really have nothing to do with RNG or recycling. Tyler, let me expand so quick on what she just said about the 600 position, because that will become close to 1,000 positions just in customer experience. And we've talked a lot over the last couple of years about automation. But we haven't really given you kind of the numbers and where it's benefiting the bottom line. This is a good example. I mean, what we really did there was used a turnover number that was close to 50%. And customer experience, took advantage of that attrition. And at the same time, we automated the customer experience, which every other industry, by the way, has done over the last 20 years, and we hadn't. It was -- ours was still kind of a person-to-person experience. We haven't eliminated the person-to-person experience, but we've just made it available, made a self-service option available to our customers. And as a result, our call volume is down close to 25%. That's a huge drop in call volume. And hence, our ability to take advantage of attrition to the tune of 600 positions in 2022 and another close to 400 positions in 2023. Well, I think we think about it -- I mean, we're thinking about pricing because there are -- there's a two-fold exercise here. One is combating cost increases or inflation, which was why the last 18 months have been so challenging, because we really felt like it was almost all, in fact, in many cases, all of it was going towards combating inflation. And then a second piece is adding a few margin points for us. So as we look at this through our price group, particularly for commercial since that's where your question was, we think that pricing will moderate a bit, because inflation is moderating significantly. And that ends up being a good thing for us. If you look at collection and disposal yield for last year versus our guidance for this year, last year was $6.7 million this year guidance is 5.5%. So there is some moderation in yield there. But significantly, we're projecting at least a significantly different cost picture. So we think the price starts to contribute to margin again, whereas, it hasn't for the last probably three years. Yeah, I think maybe one place where it might not moderate as much is on the landfill side. I mean, we have a differentiated product there and so not that we don't have a differentiated product on the collection side, but landfill in particular, the yield was 6.2% MSW last year. I think that's probably the highest annual yield for MSW maybe in our history. And I don't expect that to come back to at a lot. And I might add one thing because in your question about adding volatility, I mean, I guess you could say that. But look, as I said, and Tara has mentioned as well, this gas is coming to us regardless. I mean, this is gas that is produced by these landfills as a result of MSW going into them. And about half of it is monetized in some form today. All we're doing here is taking advantage of a situation that was presented to us, but also taking advantage of our natural gas fleet and turning that 50% that isn't monetized into some value add for shareholders. Does it add some volatility? I guess it adds some, although Tara has gone through a part of her answer to question earlier was to -- that we are looking to take some of that volatility away by fixing some of the pricing. But I think there's this view that why would you add a volatile business here? And the answer is, we're just taking gas that's being produced by these sites and turning it into a very, very profitable revenue stream with very, very strong paybacks. Well, a couple -- I think you're making a couple of points here. Just to maybe correct one thing. Price isn't going down if that's what you were implying. It's not going down. It's just going up by slightly less than it did last year. And to your question about whether we would consider spinning off the RNG business. I mean, first of all, there's a lot of options for us and we would never take any options off the table. But what Tara said earlier, which I think is important is we -- part of the value for us is that we like owning the gas, we like owning the facilities. And so for the time being, the answer is we're going to develop these ourselves. We're going to -- and we're going to see the full benefits come to ourselves. And we'll do everything we can to try and mitigate the volatility -- but we like owning the gas itself. We like being in a position -- I've been in a position in the field where I managed the landfill where we didn't own the well field. And that was not a great position to be in, having been there a number of years ago. So, we like being in a position where we manage the well fields that produce the gas. Not to say we wouldn't consider that down the road. But for now, we're kind of in our infancy and we're going to own and develop on our own for now. Yes. Yes, I'm glad you made that point, John, because we did change a lot of these contracts from four years ago, and I think that's your point. You bet. Yeah. That was my earlier point. This gives us \u2013 it gives us that spread. We had essentially no spread for the last 18 months. Suffice to say, it's the margins on this business, Michael, and whether you're looking at margins on the EBITDA side are 70%-ish maybe 75%. I mean, we'll get -- as she'll still give more detail on in April. And then as Devina went through, the cash conversion is tremendous, too. So it's why this business -- why we're so excited about it. And nobody has asked a question about M&A, but I did mention that I'd rather do a three times EBITDA investment than a 10 times EBITDA investment where there's some uncertainty about integration. So we'll talk about revenue and what it means. But these are hugely high margins on the EBITDA line with these RNG plants. I wouldn't say that any of us are macroeconomists. So whether we're projecting a recession or not is hard to say. But we are projecting some softness for sure. We saw some softness in our volume numbers, as I mentioned, probably particularly in roll-off for Q4, and that's continued a bit in January, albeit -- our numbers were a little stronger volume-wise in January. I think if we try and read those tea leaves ourselves, and we're all reading as much information as we can, it feels like there could be some type of slowdown, especially as the consumer eats through all of their savings. But I am -- the last thing I am as a macro economist. So I can't sit here and tell you, yes, we're going to see a recession next year. We're just having to manage our business to \u2013 to our own best abilities. And that's why we have taken cost control on very seriously. That's why pricing is still an important aspect of this. And then at the same time, for the long-term, these renewable natural gas facilities and automation of a number of these positions makes a lot of sense. So that really is affected by \u2013 by any downturn in the economy. Okay. Thank you. Well, we ran a bit long today, but we have a lot to cover. Thank you for your patience. Thanks for joining us and we will talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. Once again, our solid waste business was at the center of WM's strong quarterly results, capping off a great 2022. Our team delivered strong organic revenue growth with a diligent focus on leveraging core price to offset cost inflation, while prioritizing customer service and customer lifetime value to minimize customer churn, all resulting in record high yield. When combined with strong cost control, these efforts delivered an 80 basis point expansion of operating EBITDA margin in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we achieved these excellent results while investing in technology and sustainability growth that will benefit WM for years to come. Full year adjusted SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, a 40 basis point improvement over 2021 as we achieved back-office operational efficiencies through standardization and process improvement that enabled us to reduce more than 600 positions through attrition. You can clearly see our strong performance and the record cash flow from operations that we achieved in 2022, which grew 4.6% to $4.536 billion. The increase in cash allowed us to accelerate investments at year-end, which brought full year capital spending to the high end of our expectations. 2022 capital expenditures totaled $2.587 billion with $2.26 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $561 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Putting these pieces together, 2022 free cash flow was $1.976 billion despite an increase in cash taxes of $370 million. During 2022, we returned a record $2.58 billion to shareholders, paying $1.08 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.5 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $377 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability and growth investments and achieving our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times. Our balance sheet is well-positioned for growth through capital investments in our business or strategic acquisitions. Moving to our 2023 financial outlook. As John mentioned, we anticipate organic growth approaching 5.5% from yield. Given an expectation for a little more than 1% revenue growth from acquisitions, and a decrease in revenue contributions from recycled commodity sales and fuel surcharges, we anticipate total revenue growth of between 4% and 5.5%. When combining our plan to deliver strong organic revenue growth with a focus on optimization and cost control to drive 40 to 80 basis points of operating leverage, we expect to generate adjusted operating EBITDA of $5.825 billion to $5.975 billion in 2023. We expect to allocate $1.1 billion to capital investments in recycling and renewable natural gas growth projects in the coming year and 2023 is expected to be the peak investment year for each business. While these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures, and therefore, reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. We view these investments as better than an acquisition dollar as they will produce even higher return growth as a strong complement to our existing business. Our normal course capital to support our business is expected to be between $2 billion and $2.1 billion in 2023. And free cash flow is projected to be between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, including the impact of sustainability growth investments. Our outlook anticipates an increase in cash interest and taxes of $175 million to $215 million and about an $80 million headwind from working capital due in large part to the timing and amount of incentive compensation payments. As Jim discussed, even as we step up our investment in high-return recycling and renewable energy growth projects, we remain well positioned to allocate our cash among all of our capital allocation priorities, including returning cash to our shareholders. Given the Board of Directors intended 7.7% increase in the 2023 dividend rate, we expect dividend payments to total about $1.1 billion in the year ahead. We also expect to continue our share repurchase program in 2023, as the Board recently provided authorization to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our stock. While our guidance does not specifically include acquisition growth, we will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing the right deals at the right price. In closing, we are proud of what we achieved in 2022, and we're excited about the opportunities that lay ahead for 2023 and future years. I want to thank our hard-working team members for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Josh, let's open the line for questions. Good morning. Yes, Jerry, I think that that overview that you provided is spot on in terms of how it is that we're looking at margin for the year ahead, 60 basis points of margin expansion at the midpoint indicates our confidence that the momentum that we saw in the back half of 2022 should continue into 2023. We expect some of the margin pressure from the recycling part of the business to continue in the first half. So we are seeing strong fundamentals in the solid waste part of our business that should help to offset that as they did in Q4. That being said, some of the cost execution, we really are laser focused as a management team on what we're doing on the cost side of the business. And that's not just looking at inflation and responding to it but being proactive in terms of what we can do to manage it appropriately. And truck delivery trends are favorable now relative to where we started 2022, and that should give us some relief both in repair and maintenance and in truck rental costs. Our frontline retention efforts are showing really strong benefits, and we expect that to continue in 2023. We're managing down professional fees, particularly in our SG&A. And then on the SG&A front, we're also leveraging technology to automate our processes, which is improving the customer experiences and reducing our cost to serve. So all of that gives us confidence that it's our strong execution on the cost side of the equation that will complement the yield that Jim just spoke to in terms of delivering that margin expansion and exiting 2023 with 100 basis points above kind of this current run rate feels like the right target for us. Yes. So Jerry, in 2022, we were at 30%, and we're projecting in 2023 to be at 40% of our Offtake in fixed. And I think what's important to note here is we really took a look at this back in early 2022, looking at the volume ramp of our R&D, and we were pretty intentional about thinking through how to tap into those voluntary markets. So those markets today, we're seeing them be quite robust. If you think about large public utilities and industrial end users. This is a great way for them to tap into a low-carbon fuel and we're not seeing any price back at the moment. We'll give a bit more detail in April on what it looks like longer term as well. Good morning. That's correct. Yes, there's $70 million in the deck on... Tyler, I would tell you that it's too early for us to predict the impact of that to 2026 and beyond. What we're really emphasizing in our 2023 outlook is that we're starting to see some of the benefits. Yes, recycling is a piece of that. But beyond the recycling line of business, we're seeing back office to 600 headcount attrition that I mentioned in customer experience, specifically is a strong example of that. And the leverage we've gotten in SG&A margin is in large part due to some of that success. So the 40 to 80 basis points of margin expansion really is all solid waste. And so that strong performance in 2023 is an indicator of future value that we think will come as we start to see, in particular optimization efforts in the collection line of business take hold. Some of that is delayed because of truck deliveries as well as some of our efforts to take that across additional lines of business. We started in the industrial line of business intentionally, and we're seeing strong success in some of those pilots. And we're happy with where we are, but too early for us to predict how much efficiency gain we can get across all lines of business in 2020 and beyond. But I think taking the 40 to 80 basis points accomplished or predicted for 2023 is a strong indicator of the strength of those initiatives. Margins could be backward in the first quarter of the year. The pressure from the recycling line of business is the most acute. And while drop in commodity prices is typically something that we see benefit our margin in that part of the business, because of the pass-through elements of some of it. We have seen some pressure. So we are predicting some flatness, I would say, in the first quarter, with expanding margin in the second quarter, particularly on the cost side of the business and starting to see the pricing parts of the business really contribute as they did in the second half of 2022, as we anniversary some of those impacts from the recycling line of business I mentioned. So first half, second half, I would say you'll see more muted margin expansion in the first half, stronger margin expansion in the back half. That being said, I wouldn't expect the minus 100, plus 100 that we saw in 2022 because we've overcome so many of the operating cost headwinds that we were experiencing this year and really starting to see some strong momentum there. Sure. So EBITDA growth at the midpoint is $390 million, and so that will be the driver of free cash flow growth, cash flow from operations growth next year. Unfortunately, with this interest rate environment, we're going to have to give some of that back because our cost of debt is going up. As you can see, when you look at our fourth quarter results, our weighted average borrowing rate in the fourth quarter actually went up 80 basis points. And so that was an increase of $26 million in the quarter. We were virtually flat all year long in advance of Q4. And when we take that Q4 impact and extrapolate it to 2023, that's what's going to be driving our interest costs higher. So that in and of itself is a little over $100 million of impact. And then we do expect our debt balances to increase in the year ahead. Our debt balances are going to increase because we are seeing such strong growth, and we are going to be investing in all elements of capital allocation with that strong balance sheet. So not pulling back any on our allocation of cash to share buyback in the year ahead, is our current plan. We may moderate it some, but we'll give you more color on that over the course of the year. So with the higher debt balances and the higher interest cost that really is all of the $175 million to $215 million that I mentioned in interest and taxes. Taxes are actually going to be essentially flat. So while we would have expected some moderation in that, because of the one-time payment that I mentioned of $100 million, we're really seeing that offset by two things: one, higher pretax income; and the other being the expiration of a piece of bonus depreciation and the asset mix that we're putting in place. So those are the interest and tax pieces. The $80 million headwind I mentioned on working capital, we had an $88 million contribution to working capital in 2022. So we're essentially saying that, we think we might give some of that back. Some of that is a moderation in DSO, just because of the recessionary environment that we're predicting. But a large contributor is timing and amount of incentive compensation payments. You're welcome. Sure. So the color there is really inflation in our landfill costs. And it's both from normal inflationary cost pressures, as well as the regulatory environment, that's driving some of our costs for closure, post-closure higher. So the charge that we took in the fourth quarter relates predominantly to our closed site part of the portfolio, though some of it is also representative of changes we're seeing in management of the active landfills, too. In terms of next year's DD&A, we're not predicting another step change from this current level, but we are expecting DD&A levels to reflect better delivery of trucks in the year ahead. So you'll see some increased depreciation in the first half of the year rather than waiting to see all of that impact in Q4. Net-net G&A is going to be moderately higher just with the capital expenditure deliveries, but it's not going to be another step change from this level. Yes, Brian, you're spot on there. Our ability to convert revenue and EBITDA dollars to free cash flow with the sustainability investments will be heightened as we come through the investment period. Fundamentally, that's because there's a different capital outlay model for this part of our business than there is for the collection and disposal business, where you're having to spend capital dollars effectively each day that you service the customer. So with maintenance capital levels meaningfully lower in both recycling and renewable energy, we're optimistic that cash flow conversion will be stronger after this investment period. Sure. The investment we made in Natura PCR, this is really about taking film and film plastic and mechanically recycling it. Film has very low recycling rates today. And on top of that, if you look at -- all of the brands out there, CPG companies have very strong commitments to use more recycled content products. So it's a market where there is a very strong need and we have a strong fit. Also, if you think about the plastics that we collect on the brokerage side of the house, so it felt like a natural fit for us. What you're seeing in the press release are some capital dollars to invest in building out that plant portfolio in Houston and also in the Midwest, and we'll be providing a bit more information on that in April. Yes, I can speak to the commodity volatility on both sides of the business. So on the RNG side of the house, we've talked a lot and I mentioned it today that we have 40% of our volume that's really tied into fixed price markets. And then we also have the ability on the transportation side of the house to leverage WM suit and tie it into ERINs [ph]. We're really -- sorry, RINs, conventional RINs, we're really being thoughtful about how our ramp looks long term and how to tap into those fixed versus transportation markets. And so we'll give a bit more information on that in April. But suffice it to say that, it's something that we're tracking very closely, and we have a whole host of options to ensure that we can navigate that. I think there's very strong fundamentals. If you look at what the EPA did with their announcement on the renewable volume obligation and setting a three-year pathway. So it really shores up where we're headed on the renewable natural gas side of the house. On the recycling side of the house, I think what's interesting is, if you look at the $240 million in EBITDA, 60% of that is really independent of commodity prices, and that really speaks to the fact that a big piece of it is coming from labor and labor improvements. 35% exiting the quarter in labor cost per ton improvements at our automated facilities. And then revenue quality, and a great example of that is how we're able to take mixed paper and remove cardboard from those bales and sell it at a higher price premium. And that's independent of market prices. So a lot of what we're doing will help us inflate ourselves from those wings. And I would just say the midpoint of our guidance anticipated the commodity values that Terra just went through, the downside has contemplated some of the downside risk should those values be less than what we are currently predicting. The way that, I would answer the question, Michael, is if you look at our outlook for the year ahead, we're implying growth from the solid waste business of about $475 million and that rivals the highest levels of growth that we've ever seen in our history. And so what we focus on in terms of measuring solid waste performance is our ability to fundamentally grow that business over the long term, both in terms of the pricing execution and our strong focus on operating cost efficiency and those things are what are driving that $475 million target. We are predicting that strong solid waste growth coupled with some SG&A margin expansion. Those are really the two levers for next year's overall EBITDA growth. We always focus on making sure that you guys have the best information available, and we'll continue to try and meet that goal, and we'll step back and look at our disclosures and ensure that they're appropriately robust. We think that they are today, but we know we can always get better. The other thing I would point out is we did pull ahead some capital into the fourth quarter. And as a result of our ability to do that, we moderated our outlook for 2023 capital slightly from our original expectations. Should we see a need to adjust that further as we get into the year and perform well as we expect to do, particularly in the solid waste business, we might take some steps to accelerate capital that much further. But this is about strong execution on capital discipline, combined with our ability to ensure that our price isn't just addressing the operating cost side of the business, but also capital inflation. It's a great question, Michael. And what we're doing is working to segment these parts of the business very clearly so that we can articulate the level of growth that each of them is expected to have. The solid waste business has outperformed that 5% to 7% target that we established, and we couldn't be more proud of those results. In terms of what's happening in the RNG and recycling businesses, we're talking about a new step level change in our free cash flow generation for the business. Our ability to grow that, I think done a great job of articulating the fact that this opportunity and what's outlined in the supplemental deck is just a starting point for us. Our portfolio provides tremendous upside opportunity from here. Our ability to say whether that's 5% to 7% or some other number, that will come as we further articulate our plans for building out the total addressable market that we have across our landfill network. It's 10 to 20 basis points. Sure. I'll speak to the price side, and this is a footnote in our press release, but we did see pricing come down in the three categories, slight decline on the power side. And as you can imagine, we saw some record power prices related to some of the dynamics in 2022 related to weather and whatnot. So that's reflected on the power side. On the natural gas side, natural gas pricing has come down. We were north of $5 in 2022 and now coming in and around 360, that's what we're guiding to. And then on RIN prices, again, 230 is what we have in our guidance. And I think I just went over a little bit of the dynamics there. As far as the supply and demand dynamic, I think what's really important to note on the renewable natural gas side is there are two markets, and they're quite robust. The first is on the transportation side, which is where we generate D3 RINs. And for us, we're in a unique position. Jim has mentioned this before, where we own our own fleet, so we're able to capture more of the value, and we have robust discussions with obligated parties. So we're able to trade those RINs and have a long history with that. At the same time, you have this voluntary market that exists where many, many public utilities have come out with announcement where they need to decarbonize their own portfolios and the fastest way for them to do that is to buy renewable natural gas and buy renewable natural gas at a price premium. And again, we'll give you more information on this in April, but we feel really positive about the options that we have for each of those. Yes, it's a great question. And when we wish we had a specific science towards being able to predict the Q4 results were best ever in terms of the difference between core price and yield. And in large part, that speaks to the strong churn that John mentioned during his prepared remarks, the 400 basis point improvement there is a really strong indicator that price is holding with our customers and that we're doing -- I'm sorry, the comment was on robot on churn, but our churn has been really strong as well. And our ability to hold on to every core price dollar and convert that to yield really was the best we've ever seen. In terms of our ability to predict that we'd still see those levels in 2023, I think it actually goes back to Stephanie's question earlier about the macroeconomic outlook. We used our long-term averages of converting our core price dollar to yield, rather than the fourth quarter launch pad. Because we view the macroeconomic environment is a little more uncertain than it is today, though we are seeing those signs of self-antigen done a good job of articulating. We do think that all indicators point to a soft recession in '23, and we didn't want to overpredict our ability to convert core price to yield in the year ahead."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Jim described our fantastic results in 2022 and that all begins with our collection and disposal business. In the face of some of the highest inflationary cost pressures, our collection and disposal business delivered double-digit in adjusted EBITDA for the full year. During the fourth quarter, collection and disposal results were even more impressive as adjusted operating EBITDA grew more than 11% and margin expanded 40 basis points. This momentum sets the stage for continued growth in 2023 and strengthens our conviction that the investments we're making in our people in automation and in differentiating our service offerings are the right decisions. The growth in our collection and disposal business starts at the top of the income statement with robust organic revenue growth. Full year core price was 7.8% with collection and disposal yield of 6.7% and volume of 1.8%. As we work to keep pace with decades high inflation, our revenue management teams delivered record core price in 2022 in every one of our lines of business, led by 10.5% in our commercial line of business. We talk often about our focus on generating appropriate returns in our residential and post-collection lines of business. And in 2022, we delivered core price of 6.5% in the residential line of business, 6.4% at our landfills and 5.9% at our transfer stations. Our revenue metrics demonstrate that our customers' receptivity to our pricing remained favorable through the fourth quarter. Our rollback percentage was almost 400 basis points better for the full year, while new business pricing increased more than 6% in our commercial line of business. The results clearly demonstrate our ability to manage cost pressures through continued pricing discipline and momentum, while maintaining our focus on customer lifetime value. As we move into 2023, our disciplined pricing programs combined with the strong momentum from 2022 and are expected to deliver core price of between 6.5% and 7% with yield approaching 5.5%. Our expectation is for strong rollover of 2022 price performance. Given the acute inflationary environment in 2022, we increased certain fees that we don't expect to step up again at the same level. We remain committed to securing pricing that outpaces our cost inflation, which is demonstrated by the operating EBITDA margin expansion that we're anticipating in 2023. Shifting to volumes. In the fourth quarter, event-driven volumes remained strong with special waste and C&D volumes growing double digits. Our commercial and industrial volumes were positive for the full year. However, we saw some softening in the fourth quarter. Given these recent trends, we are tempering our volume expectations in the year ahead. Our guidance includes 2023 collection and disposal volumes that are relatively flat with 2022. We continue to see the rate of labor increases easing in our business, and we remain focused on managing our operating expenses and flexing down costs, flexing costs down with the changing volumes. In our collection and disposal business, we are seeing improvements in our labor costs as inflationary wage pressures are easing. Turnover trends are improving and the investments that we are making in automation are showing benefits. These improvements were on display in the fourth quarter \u2013 in our fourth quarter results as we saw operating expense margin improved by 30 basis points despite still stubbornly higher maintenance and repair costs. For the full year of 2022, operating expenses increased 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue, but that was largely driven by negative impacts from higher fuel costs and recycling commodity prices that together impacted the measure by 80 basis points. This increase was partially offset by lower labor and related benefits costs in our collection and disposal business and improved risk management costs. Putting it all together, when you combine our pricing efforts with our progress on cost containment, we expect 2023 operating expense as a percentage of revenue to improve between 30 and 50 basis points for the full year, with those improvements beginning in the second quarter of 2023. In the fourth quarter, our recycling operating EBITDA remained solidly positive even with the sharp decline in commodity prices to about $47 per ton. Over the last several years, we have intentionally taken steps to shift the business to a fee-for-service model that has reduced our sensitivity to commodity market changes. When we started this journey in 2017, commodity prices were 60% higher than what we are anticipating in our 2023 outlook, yet 2023 operating EBITDA is expected to be about 13% higher than in 2017. This clearly demonstrates that our business model is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. As we look to the future of recycling, we remain focused on advancing automation across our MRF network, which we have proven can lower the cost of process material, achieve better quality while enhancing recycling profitability. Our employees delivered strong results in 2022, and I want to thank the entire WM team for their commitment to providing the best customer service while focusing on improving our operations. The team has done an exceptional job, and I know that this will continue in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our 2022 financial results and 2023 financial outlook in further detail. I think the only one I would make there, Jim, is the residential line of business, specific if you look at our volume loss there, clearly, we continue to make deliberate decisions. We mentioned some of the franchises that we've parted ways with. And even if you look at the 4.5% or 4.7% negative volume, our revenue was still up over $50 million for the quarter in residential. And as we've said, we're going to continue down that path until we get acceptable returns and margins for that line of business. And so we're happy with that progress. We don't like intentionally shedding that business but under these conditions, like Jim said, the inflation is what we're combating and it's been most acute in residential, partly due to the labor intensity there. Yes, that's a good question. A few things are happening on that front. One is we've digitized a lot of the customer-facing elements of sort of these transactions. So customers have the better ability to transact with us when and how they want to from a digital perspective. We're seeing that translate to NPS scores, not a surprise that we in the beginning of the year had some dips in our NPS scores as we were challenged on some of the labor and asset fronts that Devina and Jim commented on, but that started to improve in the second half of the year, which has also helped our service quality. So, we're seeing our NPS score start to move the right way in the back half of the year. And we're also, at the same time, seeing the benefits from some of the labor arbitrage. As Jim mentioned, these are not jobs we're moving out. These are jobs that we're not replacing because they're because they're high turnover. And I think Tara and Jim gave good color on what's happening with the recycling and the recycling front with respect to automation benefits. And we've touched on the other big bucket is moving from sort of the traditional manual rear load system to the ASL system, that's another element of automation where we're clearly seeing benefits. I think Jim -- I was just going to add on the recycling side. If you look at that separately from the RNG comments you made, if you went back five or six years ago and looked at the commodity price versus what their earnings stream was out of the recycling facilities was much different. But in my prepared comments, you earn at $47 a ton. We're still seeing strong earnings and returns in our -- in all of our MRFs, not to mention the fact that when you were to carve out the automated plants, which is only a small portion, we're going to add to that next year, as Tara mentioned, those margins are even higher. So I would argue that we've taken out a lot of the volatility in the recycling business, and that's why you continue to see our conviction in those investments going forward. No, sir. Michael, no, we are not. I would tell you, Michael, I think with Devina and I can share this \u2013 we all do on OpEx. But I think to Jim's point, we were kind of arm wrestling with it, I forget the phrase used, Jim. I think the efforts that we undertook last year and what happened in the last two quarters, in particular, the fourth quarter make us feel really good about what's happening on the solid waste side and some of the commentary was about price and yield and the movement. But when you see OpEx, our guidance on OpEx moving the way it is for next year and the EBITDA improvement in Devina said what the strength of the solid waste business is we feel really good about how we're entering 2023. I think, Michael, if you look at the inflationary pressure and the performance on the revenue side related to that, we've been also very sensitive to the fact that capital shouldn't just necessarily go up because revenue is. We're looking at it by line of business and what's happened from a volume perspective. And I think that's what you're seeing part of the leverage there. On the supply side, Michael, I would tell you, this was a challenging year in terms of juggling CapEx mostly because of the truck-related issues that we had. So 2023 will be more balanced, but I think you're seeing the sub-10 number as a result of our discipline around capital dollars."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Tara Hemmer",
            "content": "The only other thing I would just add to what Jim said regarding the acceleration of the investment is the investment tax credit and the fact that, that is a really strong pathway for us to get some tax credits on our investments and there's a timeline associated with that. And we feel really positive about where we are in our ability to capture those tax credits. We've modeled about $300 million, which you see in the deck. Regarding our broader portfolio, I mean, this is one of the reasons why we talk about this opportunity being so great because we preserved so many options for WM because we own the gas. We own our projects. We announced 20 projects. There's a whole pipeline that can come after that. And then with the e-RINs [ph] pathway, if you look at our legacy landfill gas to electricity projects, we can create an earnings stream with no incremental capital, and that's not in our numbers today. So, that's upside long-term. So, we're really optimistic about what we have in front of us here. Yes. So John mentioned in his remarks, the 35% reduction on our automated plants on labor cost per ton, and that's what we saw in Q4. And then that 137 number is related to the headcount attrition related to automation in 2022, and we're expecting 200 in 2023. Yes. So just to clarify, it's $70 per ton in our commodity basket, not on OCC, just to -- Yes. So $70 a ton number for 2023, exiting December of this year, just north of $50 a ton. And we're seeing some signs on the plastic side, is a great example, where we're seeing plastic pricing increase a bit. And we've seen that uptick related to, again, CPG companies trying to meet their sustainability commitments on using recycled content. So we expect, if you look at that ramp through Q1, Q2, Q3, we'll start to see that ramp over the quarters when you look at how commodity prices will move on the recycling side of the business. And then, on the renewable energy side of the house, that $2.30 RIN price, exiting 2022, RIN prices were higher. We've seen a bit of a dip on RIN pricing that definitely recognizes what we're seeing in the market today and where we expect it will hedge throughout 2023. Just remember, 40% of our off-take is fixed. So the other 60% is exposed. Today, we have 40% fixed based on the roughly 4 million MMBtu, and so that is what is fixed today. We're working on fixing more of that longer-term. Yes. We have a goal. We'll give you more information on that in April, Michael. We have a pathway to have a portfolio mix longer-term. We're going to unpack that in April. You're talking about revenue, yes, revenue on the RNG business. You can -- I think you could figure it out based on the $26 per MMBtu number we gave you. Yeah. I think the important thing to remember here is that earlier in -- really in December of 2022, EPA came out with their that rule, which on the positive side, set a three-year framework for renewable volume obligations, which for us for the long-term is positive because at the end of the day, it really sets the standard for the program and the RIN pathway for us. I think there's been a little bit of speculation in the marketplace around whether or not those were the right numbers that EPA issued. We're confident that come June when EPA issues their final rule, there'll be more clarity. So I think that's a little bit of what you're seeing. But long-term, strong fundamentals on the price side related to RINs. So, the important thing to remember is it's a proposed rule and EPA will be coming out with our final framework sometime over the summer. I think from our perspective though, you got to look at the 66 landfill gas to electricity plants that we have, that we own. And this, we believe, will be a significant revenue stream for us long term. It's a great example of our ability, where we have owned these facilities and invested in them and retained the value. Now, we're in a position to optimize the value with this pathway. So, really waiting for a bit more color from EPA on what their final framework is going to look like, but really optimistic. Again, no incremental CapEx on that potential revenue stream. Yes, great question. I think we're -- first and foremost, we're really confident on the path that we're on with the 20 projects that we have in the deck. And we're actively looking at our portfolio. We're going to make the best economic decision, the best environmental decision. And the good news is, we have a lot of options here. I mean, that's something that Jim said earlier on, good, really good or great. We view these frameworks as great for WM. So we're going to evaluate what makes the most sense for us long term."

Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, growing adjusted operating EBITDA by 11% compared to last year. The outperformance is driven by the strength and resiliency of our collection and disposal business. In a quarter where the preponderance of macroeconomic discussion is centered around signs of a slowing economy, WM's collection and disposal operating EBITDA grew by more than 12% and margins expanded 60 basis points. Collection and disposal organic revenue growth was 8.8%, elevating quarterly total revenue -- company revenue to above $5 billion for the second consecutive quarter. The growth was delivered -- excuse me, the growth we delivered was driven by delivered steps to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs, which together, position us to overcome inflationary pressures. Our solid results through the first 9 months of the year position us well to achieve the updated guidance provided last quarter, even with a recent downturn in recycling commodity prices. An important contributor to our improving trend in operating expenses and overall cost structure is the strategic decision to leverage, through automation, the tight labor market and high attrition. John will touch on this as he discusses our significantly improved turnover in more detail. By the end of 2022, we will have reached almost 1,000 full-time positions in difficult-to-source job categories that we've chosen not to refill, putting us well on our way to reducing our labor dependency by 5,000 to 7,000 jobs. We're pleased to see early benefits from our investments to reduce our cost to serve while also differentiating WM by enhancing the customer experience. Continuing on this discussion of our 2023 and beyond strategy, we're very pleased with our investments we're making in both renewable natural gas and recycling businesses. On RNG, we continue to make great progress on building out our new plants as we expect 2023 to be the heaviest capital investment year. We're on track to see meaningful earnings contributions from 2022 and 2023 investments in 2024, with full incremental operating EBITDA contributions coming in 2026, which are conservatively estimated at $400 million. Our recycling business not only provides an important service that our customers want and need, it continues to be a profitable business generating solid returns. We worked hard to adjust our business model over the last several years, and we saw the results of that in the third quarter, particularly in our automated facilities. Our 5 fully automated MRFs are now delivering differentiated results relative to our single stream network, with about 30% lower labor costs, 13% lower total operating costs, nearly double the operating EBITDA margin and most importantly, a 40% improvement in key safety metrics. We're on track to complete four automation projects and add one new MRF in 2022. The significant investments that we're making in growing and automating our MRF network are strengthening the business by reducing costs, increasing throughput and improving product quality. As with our R&D investments, 2023 will be the heaviest year of capital spending, and the rebuilding of our single-stream MRFs was the biggest increase in incremental earnings coming in 2024 and 2025 as the majority of the rebuild and new MRFs come online. Additionally, as part of our commitment to growing our recycling business, we announced that we are acquiring a controlling interest in Avangard Innovative's U.S. business. The planned acquisition will grow our plastics recycling capabilities by delivering circular solutions for films and clear plastic wrap used commercially. We expect to receive investment returns comparable to our recycling automation investments yet on a more prolonged horizon, given that operations are in the early stages of scaling. We plan to provide a more detailed update during our fourth quarter earnings call once the deal closes. Also on the M&A front, we completed more than $200 million of acquisitions in the third quarter, putting us well on our way to our full year expectation of $300 million to $400 million. We closed two nicely-sized solid waste tuck-in acquisitions in Indiana and Arizona during the quarter. These acquisitions are a complement to our existing operations that we expect to generate solid returns and earnings contribution in 2023. And finally, I'm pleased to share that earlier this month, we released our 2022 sustainability report, providing details on our ESG performance and outlining our new 2030 priorities. These new priorities are strongly linked with our overall company strategy and directly support expansion of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Even as we celebrate continued progress in our sustainability journey, we're already focused on driving improvements in the future. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. We're focused on finishing 2022 strong while continuing to progress our investments in recycling, renewable energy and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Exceptional organic revenue growth continued to be a key contributor to our strong results in the third quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 7.1%. Robust core price across every line of business led to third quarter core price of 8.2%, up 70 basis points from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize customer lifetime value in our pricing strategies, and we maintained third quarter churn of 8.7% when adjusted for steps we took to intentionally shed three large unprofitable contracts. We remain focused on disciplined pricing in the fourth quarter, positioning us to achieve our full year revenue growth guidance of about 10%. In the third quarter, volume remained at healthy levels as workday adjusted collection and disposal volume grew by 1.7%, including special waste volume growth of nearly 15%. Commercial volume adjusted for the contract losses I mentioned was 1.4%. We continue to grow volumes as our team's focus on differentiating WM as a preferred service provider. In addition, our teams in Florida are rising to the challenges from Hurricane Ian, taking care of their teammates and communities. While there were increased costs from business disruption and property losses in the quarter related to the hurricane, we are well positioned to handle storm volume as clean-up activity ramped up in fourth quarter. We remain focused on controlling operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.2% of revenue in the third quarter, in line with prior year. And while we still see high single-digit inflation, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the solid waste business improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Over last year, we made significant investments in our people, including proactive wage adjustments, an improved benefit package and increased training. Those investments are paying off as driver turnover improved 410 basis points in the past three months, and sequentially, the rate of increase in labor costs improved more than 400 basis points.  [Indiscernible] repair costs remain elevated and are being impacted by the slowdown in truck deliveries, a tight labor market for technicians and higher cost for parts and third-party services. The impact of higher fuel costs increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 50 basis points. This increase was completely offset by the alternative fuel tax credits realized in the third quarter related to the first half of 2022. While cost inflation appears to be easing, the inflationary environment only serves to reinforce our commitment to using technology and automation to reduce our labor dependency across the business and lower our cost to serve. As Jim discussed, we continue to have strong conviction in our recycling business. While global markets drive the value of recycled commodities, the steps we've taken over the past few years to shift around 85% of our third-party volumes to a fee-for-service model provides protection on the downside. So while there is a level of earnings variability, the recycling business is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. Our blended average commodity rate in the third quarter was about $94 per ton. We are assuming a blended commodity value of about $50 per ton for the fourth quarter of 2022, which compares to $132 in the same quarter of 2021. These recent commodity market moves, combined with persistent cost inflation, are expected to be about a $50 million year-over-year headwind to operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter. We're very focused not only managing costs in recycling business but also investing in automation across our MRF network to structurally lower the cost of processed material and achieve better quality, which further enhances the protections afforded by our fee-for-service model while providing profitability lift even in the toughest markets. In the renewable energy business, we continue to see strong performance with operating EBITDA in the first 9 months growing $24 million. The second of our 17 new RNG plants announced at the beginning of the year is on track for completion at the end of the year and is expected to begin generating revenue in the third quarter following EPA certification to generate RINs credits. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, and we continue to operate our business with notable focus on disciplined cost control and responsible revenue quality improvements. I want to thank the entire WM team for their invaluable contributions to our success. I will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen all year, our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, driven by organic revenue growth, diligent cost management and proactive steps to automate the business. We continue to see improvement in our collection and disposal business as our strategic focuses on fostering a people-first culture and investing in automation are driving nearly tangible results. Adjusted operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew $174 million in the quarter, which contributed to total company operating EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points to 28.6%. Performance in the collection and disposal business, net of fuels, drove 120 basis points of margin improvement. Operating EBITDA margins also benefited 50 basis points from the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which secured alternative fuel tax credits through 2024. These 50 basis points relates to the catch-up adjustment we made in the quarter to recognize the benefits of these credits for the first half of 2022. Partially offsetting these very strong results were headwinds of 50 basis points from recycling commodity prices, 30 basis points from the impact of higher fuel costs, 20 basis points from increased technology and automation investments and 20 basis points from damage to some of our facilities and vehicles caused by Hurricane Ian. Proactive management of SG&A continues to be an important element of our business optimization efforts. In the third quarter, SG&A was 9.2% of revenue, a 50 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. Through the first 9 months of the year, SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, which is consistent with the full year outlook we provided last quarter. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations increased more than 4%, driven by operating EBITDA growth of nearly 10%. Cash flow from operations growth is muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, higher bonus payments, a delay in cash benefits from alternative fuel tax credits and some moderation in working capital benefits from last year when we saw significant benefits from our new source to pay system. Through the first 9 months of the year, capital expenditures have totaled $1,725,000,000 with just over $1.4 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $322 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. As I mentioned in July, we were starting to see some encouraging signs of improvements in truck deliveries, and we're gaining traction on our sustainability investment project. These early indicators continued throughout the third quarter, and we're pleased with the increased pace of capital investment that our teams have secured. We currently expect this accelerated rate of capital to continue in the fourth quarter, positioning us to finish the year on plan for capital expenditures. Turning to our 2022 outlook. Our solid operational performance in the first 9 months of the year positions us to achieve the guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents an operating EBITDA margin of 28.1% at the midpoint. Our operational performance puts us on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance of greater than $2.15 billion. However, in the fourth quarter, we now anticipate making an additional cash tax payment of about $100 million related to a 2017 matter. Considering this payment, we expect 2022 free cash flow of between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion. When we call all of this together, we're pleased to report results that meet or exceed expectations across all key financial metrics. Combining this strong performance with the stability and certainty afforded by a healthy balance sheet, business confidence in our ability to deliver on strategic priorities through the uncertain economic backdrop. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.65x and 19% of our debt portfolio had variable rates. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the company's performance in 2022. We have strong conviction that the investments we are making in growing our sustainability businesses and in using technology and automation to optimize our business are setting us up for future success. The team remains hard at work on delivering a strong finish to the year and setting a solid foundation for 2023. With that, Katherine, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James.\nPatrick Brown: Jim, just to start, I know you guys mentioned that you broadly maintained the guidance for the full year. I think that included the EBITDA of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. But obviously, that's a pretty big range with one quarter left. I know we've got a lot of movement in commodities. We've got a weak Canadian dollar. Are we kind of tracking more towards the low end of that range? Just any help would be appreciated just to kind of tighten up that range.\nJim Fish: I think we're tracking still around the midpoint, Tyler. I mean, it is a fairly broad range of $100 million, but we feel pretty comfortable about the midpoint. Some of it obviously depends on what happens in Florida. But for the year, it's going to be a little bit of a positive. I mean -- actually, a little bit of a negative. We were $20 million cost for Q3 and Q4 combined is what we expect it to be. And so right now, we're estimating kind of a $15 million benefit. That will change. And so that's going to help determine where we finish within that $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. So I'd say it's a little bit of a negative. That is based on what we know today, but that number will certainly change. And so that's why we're thinking that the middle of the range is achievable.\nPatrick Brown: And then, Devina, I know it's just maybe a little too early to give too much. But when we start thinking about some of the puts and takes on free cash flow next year, number one, can you just kind of remind us what your floating debt mix is? And at current rates, is that a headwind? Two, how do we think about cash taxes in light of this $100 million payment? And three, will some of the incentive comp bonuses be paid, will that be a headwind or a tailwind as we think about '23?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. That's a great question, Tyler. And I think in order to frame it the right way, I'd focus on how we finish 2022, and 2022 has been a fantastic free cash flow year for us. And really, we start that and look at it most importantly on EBITDA strength. When I look at what we expected for the year, we were expecting a $300 million to $400 million increase in EBITDA on a year-over-year basis, and we're going to knock that out of the park and finish the year. We've already achieved $371 million of EBITDA growth through 9 months. And so when you think of the fact that we should deliver another $100 million to $200 million of growth in the fourth quarter, it really does speak to the strength of the year. When we look at the headwinds though for the year ahead, it really is what's creating a little bit of noise in our 2022 free cash flow. Interest and tax is leading the way but there is some working capital noise as well. On the interest and taxes line, we now expect a headwind on a year-over-year basis of about $250 million. We started expecting that headwind to be $75 million to $125 million. And when I look ahead, the fourth quarter payment I mentioned relating to the 2017 matter really doesn't do anything to change the trend of cash taxes. But the trend of cash taxes will be impacted by the step change in bonus depreciation. So there's a 20% reduction in the amount of benefit from bonus depreciation in the year ahead. That will create some sort of impact. I haven't yet quantified that. We'll give you more color on that in the fourth quarter. Interest, on the other hand, will be more significant. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about 20% of our debt is at floating rate. When I look at that, combined with the rate resets on maturing debt, you've got about $2.2 billion of our debt balances that will be exposed to some rate lease set in the next 12 months. We're currently projecting that could be about $100 million headwind in the year ahead, but more color because, candidly, that number has changed very dramatically in the last three months. Three months ago, I was looking at a $40 million annualized headwind. So to see that move that much in just a 3-month period is quite significant. On the working capital side, through 9 months, we've had a headwind of $22 million from not having cash from the alternative fuel tax credits. Right now, we expect that to normalize. And for '22 to '23, there should be no impact from that whatsoever. On the incentive comp side, that's a headwind this year of about $40 million. Incentive compensation is expected to be higher for '22 performance than it was for '21, so there could be an incremental headwind for that in the year ahead, but I don't have specific amounts to share. All in all, what I would say is the below-the-line headwinds are offset substantially by that growth that we're seeing in the EBITDA of the business, particularly from strong solid waste performance. And as we continue to make capital investments in sustainability businesses, there will be noise associated with what that total free cash flow number looks like over the long term. But we expect to see growth in core solid waste performance that track to those long-term trends and even exceed the long-term trends that we've set forth.\nPatrick Brown: I'm sure there'll be some talk about pricing so I'll go ahead and turn it over.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Tyler just teed it up. Why don't we talk about pricing? This year, some of the strongest pricing we've really seen. How are you thinking about pricing in terms of a trajectory into '23? I know some of that's already just based on the inflation this year sort of locked in. Just how are you thinking about the trajectory there?\nJim Fish: Obviously, pricing continues to be a key driver for us on the top line. All of the lines of business show really significant price strength. Commercial yield was approaching 10% at 9.81% for industrial, 6.3% resi. So -- and then I guess, 6.5% on the line. I expect that price will continue to be an important driver of our earnings. We've kind of been using price to combat this inflation issue over the last 12 months, and so most of it is really good cost recovery. I'd want to get to a point where price is not just cost recovery but also margin expansion. And I think that's going to be the theme for price going forward. We do expect that inflation will start to come back down a bit in 2023. And so I think we were asked the question last quarter, what's the ideal inflation number. I don't know what the ideal inflation number is, but I said it's not 9%. I know that. And so I think you'll start to see us apply a little bit more price to margin expansion, not just cost recovery, and that's really what it's been. Even with very high price numbers, it's been something that we've had to do in order to cover the cost inflation. I will say this, I think maybe a piece of our earnings and Devina and John have talked about how good solid waste was, but the piece that might have been the most surprising to us was volume really. If you think about collection and disposal volume being positive 1.7%, and there was a little bit of a headwind in there with the hurricane. But still, 1.7% at a time when everybody is speculating about when is the economy going to turn down was really impressive to us. I looked at our numbers this morning. Special waste was still up 50% last week. So our volume continues to be relatively good and that was the positive part for us. I think you -- when we ask why are we seeing that? I think it's probably two things. So even in the face of really pretty heavy pricing, I think we are seeing us continue to take market share. And I also think you're seeing our service show up better than our competition, which is positive for us.\nToni Kaplan: I wanted to ask also about the commodity basket. I know you talked about it and sized it in the prepared remarks. But could you just remind us, I guess, I know you have in the past had some sort of sharing agreements with customers to mitigate exposure to commodities. I guess what percentage of contracts have that or however you think about sort of the mitigation of being exposed totally to the price? And I know you have the recycling brokerage business. And does that sort of mitigate you as well? And I guess outside of OCC, which commodities are you most exposed to?\nJim Fish: So Toni, on the brokerage piece, we've always said that certainly augments what we do in our -- in the piece of the business that we actually process the material. And that's low margin, no capital, but from a return standpoint, it makes a lot of sense and helps us leverage our ability to move all the materials. So we still feel good about that business. From a marginal standpoint, it actually abates from the margin as prices go down. On the traditional side, we've talked about how we protect the business on the downside two ways. One is floor pricing for some of the fiber grades that we have, and that's certainly something we consider when we're talking about the movement in fiber prices and how it affects the overall P&L. The second piece is really what we've done from a fee-for-service model over the last couple of years. And I think the takeaway is, while we're showing some variability and profitability at these prices have taken such a precipitous drop, and it's really mostly the fiber side, the takeaway is the business is still performing well. We're still happy with it. It's making money and it's not changed our long-term view of what we're going to do on the recycling business.\nJohn Morris: Yes. Let me one add there, and that is to give you a little bit of insight into what we've done with these contracts, just to put this in perspective, if -- when the price drops from $110, and this is our bucket of commodities, dropped from $110 to $100, the impact on that is about -- on earnings, it's about $8 million, $8.1 million to be exact. If the price were to drop from $50 to $40, the impact is only about $3 million, a little bit more than, a little maybe $3.5 million. So you can see that as price drops, the negative impact on EBITDA really starts to slow. And that is representative of all the changes we made contractually over the last five years. And to John's point, even with a significant drop-off in price for the third quarter and expecting that in the fourth quarter, too, that we still have the ninth best recycling quarter in our history for Q3. I don't think we would have been saying that five years ago.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering if we could -- can we talk about how you're thinking about your collection and disposal pricing from here? Just conceptually, do you feel like with the headwinds in recycling, we now need to push pricing more on the collection and disposal part of the business to offset the $100-plus million headwind in EBITDA from recycling into next year? Said another way, do you feel like you've got enough pieces in place to continue to push percent margins as we think about what the next 12 months might look like?\nJohn Morris: Yes. I mean, I kind of think of them a little differently. They're such different businesses from a price perspective. I will say this about price in the solid waste business. I feel like there's room for price increases. Jerry, we went for almost 15 years with kind of nothing. I remember talking about 1% price, 1% volume many, many years ago. So the business really went for quite a long time without getting any price increases. And yet now all we're doing is trying to recover this, as I said, this four-year high inflation. I think in the core business, in the solid waste business, you'll continue to see us use price in a significant way to cover cost but also improve margins. At the same time, as John and I have discussed, taking cost out of the organization, taking advantage of this tight labor markets through attrition, we saw a fair amount of that in '22. We'll see more '23 and '24.\nDevina Rankin: I think the other thing I would point out on the margin side, Jerry, is if you look at Q3 of 2022 as a barometer of how we're performing, we talked about solid waste improving on a year-over-year basis by 120 basis points based on where we are today. And the impact from recycling commodity prices being 50 basis points of an offset to that. And we're really happy to say that we delivered 28.6% so I think that's a great indicator of where we're starting '23. And so that's with the headwind of recycling almost fully baked in. And so I think we're set up well with where the pricing levels are today. And then we have continued expectations for price based on the rollover of our index pricing that happened in the first half of '23 that sets us up well there too.\nJerry Revich: And can I just shift topics on the landfill gas side? And nice to see 30% of your volumes locked in. I'm wondering, can you just talk about the terms are prior to last week's announcement was talking about the market essentially being in the 20s with attractive escalators for long-term deals. Can you comment on, is that similar to the structure that you're seeing or any additional context you could provide for us on the terms?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question. And what we're looking at is the mix of business that we'll have over time. And if we look at our expectations for how this portfolio grows, we could see our renewable energy grow 6x from where it is today. And with that level of growth, we've got to look at this as a portfolio. And the step that we took and that you saw the results of in the third quarter to secure some of this pricing over the long term is an indication of our desire to ensure that we're securing returns as we outlined in our initial expectations. So as Jim mentioned, those are certainly conservative outlooks for how we see this business grow. I won't specifically speak to the terms of the contracts that we have in place. But as we have thought about it, these are on the longer end of what we expect to do. As we manage this portfolio over time, they're more on the 10-year end where we think that we will also be managing things with three- to-five-year contracts as the portfolio grows.\nJerry Revich: Super. And lastly, can you just talk about how the voluntary landfill gas purchase market is coming in so non-RIN market? How is the marketplace developing? Obviously, on paper, a lot of folks have commitments to purchase landfill gas. I'm wondering as you're having the conversations, how have the conversations played out versus your expectations on market debt?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. That's one of the key points that Tara and her team keep speaking to us about, that this is not just the transportation part of the market, it's the non-transportation part of the market. And people in public utilities and institutions who are looking to decarbonize are seeing the RINs market as an attractive place to help to achieve their goals and objectives, which I think is speaking to the strong demand and outlook for the years ahead. We do expect the other thing that will help bolster some clarity on the outlook for this business will be the EPA setting rule in Q4. And so hopefully, those things working together will give us better visibility as we set our expectations for the earnings contributions of this business in '23 and beyond, which we'll give you color on in the fourth quarter call.\nJim Fish: I think, Jerry, it's important to point out that this big investment that we announced a couple of quarters ago really is only covering 17 new plants. And we have close to 100, and we discussed this with you when we're on the road, 100 landfills that could go into that bucket. Right now, we're really focusing on just 17. So there's a lot of opportunity to grow the business beyond that.\nJerry Revich: Super appreciate the discussion, and don't worry, we won't put the 100 million in our models yet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: First, just a little bit of housekeeping on the recycling impact in the quarter. Can you maybe help us understand, was there anything in the timing of how quickly the basket dropped in the quarter that impacted your profitability versus, say, a normalized run rate? Because it does seem like the decrementals were a little bit higher maybe in quarter than what you are talking about even for 4Q or on a run rate basis.\nJohn Morris: Yes. I think that was certainly the precipitous drop, particularly in the fiber markets. There's a little bit of lag there so you'd argue there was a little bit of an outsized impact on the quarter. I think what I would point to, Noah, is we looked at the -- not just the sequential but the quarter-over-quarter change in pricing and how that affected the overall EBITDA headwind. And I think what you're seeing is resiliency in the business that we would, to Jim's point, we wouldn't have seen four or five years ago. It's still profitable business. And if you look at kind of the old calculation of what this $10 a ton means, we've certainly separated from that. You can see that in what we did in Q3 and you can see in Q4 going from $130 to $94 produced a $36 million headwind. And for Q4, we're seeing $50 a ton going from $131 to $50 is a $50 million headwind. And as I pointed out, it's still a profitable business. So I think we've achieved a big part of our goal. But specifically on your question, because of the precipitous drop, there's probably a little bit of a lag there.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. And I just want to clarify, I think someone earlier talked about a $100 million headwind from where recycling is that today going into 2023, if we just sort of levelize today. Is that math correct? I think Jim had mentioned the decrementals would actually get even better as we get to lower levels here. So if we just take today's basket price and say, okay, here's where we're at for 2022, as we enter 2023, do we have a $100 million headwind or should it be something less?\nJohn Morris: Yes. No, I think -- I don't think it's going to be $100 million. of it is if we had a crystal ball where the price is going to look like. And we have a view of what pricing will do. And I think you'll see a little bit of improvement from Q4 to Q1 and then sequentially throughout the year. The level of improvement is really what is going to drive that answer. But I don't think even in this environment, it's, I think, quite $100 million.\nNoah Kaye: And one quick one on pricing and churn, if you don't mind. You talked about kind of continued headroom for pricing. That certainly makes a lot of sense. Can you talk a little bit about kind of the current customer discussions and whether you're starting to see any greater pushback on price? It would sort of point to some of the macro concerns that people have been raising.\nJohn Morris: Yes. If you look year-to-date and even quarter-over-quarter, you can see the improvement that we've made both in core price and yield. But we didn't talk too much about it but it's a good spot. When we look at a, we're still growing volume in commercial, industrial when you take out a little bit of the noise I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The residential piece, again, we've got a strategy there that we've employed over the last couple of years. But the other thing we look at is obviously what's going on in Net Promoter Score, customer receptivity, the pricing. We're looking at churn. We're looking at holdbacks, and holdbacks actually improved quarter-over-quarter. So all indications are that the pricing activities we,re engaged in. And we've taken a much more strategic look at that over the last handful of years and use some tools that we didn't have a handful of years ago. And I think that's why you're seeing the uplift in pricing performance without really conceding our ability to grow volume and take some share.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMichael Hoffman: If we could come back to price, has core crossed the lines of business and yields peaked yet? And if not, when do you think you start hitting a peak?\nJim Fish: Core -- did you ask as core price peaked?\nMichael Hoffman: Yes, right. Yes, core price and then the conversion to yield, which, by the way, you had a very good conversion to yield this quarter. It's improved each quarter. So I'm trying to understand the core and yield overall and then that [Audio Gap] conversion ratio, has it peaked?\nJim Fish: It's a tough question to answer just because I don't know exactly what happens with inflation. But what we did say is we expect inflation probably starts to come back down, which then would imply that core price has peaked. If inflation went to 15%, which nobody expects, then I would tell you the answer is no. So for now, I think you could say that core price has peaked. I think the most important aspect though of pricing is the point that we've made a couple of times, which is instead of just recovering costs, we'd love to be able to have a little margin with price. And for most of 2022, it's been kind of fighting this inflation battle with pricing.\nMichael Hoffman: Sorry, Devina. Go ahead, sorry.\nDevina Rankin: Your point on the conversion of a core price seller to a yield dollar is a great one. And I think it goes to what John was speaking about just recently on customer receptivity rollbacks turn. And we do really think that all of that is being benefited by was a tough operating environment right now and the hard work that the men and women who pick up the garbage for all of our communities every day are doing. It's a tough labor environment. Operators are seeing challenges, and we are differentiating our services and continue to be a go-to service provider. And so when price is most affected in translating to yield, it's when we hold on to existing customers. And because our service levels are differentiated and because small competitors are having a hard time meeting the needs because driver availability has been a challenge, we are holding on to more and more of our customers and differentiating ourselves each day. And I think that, that will continue to be a strength for the business in the year ahead.\nMichael Hoffman: So the segue for me on all of that is your entry price going into '23 basically should reflect your exit price coming out of '22. And then you are all alluding to, there's structurally a point at least to volumes. So we're having conversations as you're somewhere around 8 on the top and I'm asking for directional not guidance, just am I in the right neighborhood? You're 8 on the top before you get the M&A rollover, which I would love to hear what your current thought is on your M&A rollover. And then costs start coming down. So I think there is a wider-than-normal spread setting up between where you're going to report a price and where your actual costs are going to play out over the course of the year. And that would lead you to above-average margins. And Devina, you suggested we should start with the 28.6% as sort of a baseline and then it can improve. If I do that, looking at this year, I'm having -- you're having above-average margin expansion here in '23. Have I thought about that correctly?\nDevina Rankin: I think when you think about the solid waste business in isolation that is absolutely correct. We have talked about the recycling line of business and the headwind increase and that will be a drag on margin, particularly in the first half of '23. But I think your overall thesis about pricing and exiting '22 and crossing over into the beginning of '23 is the right one. And the flow-through of that to earnings expansion to Jim's point about wanting to see more of that really start to be more than accretive rather than just covering our cost. I think we'll start to see better traction on that in '23. I'll give you two data points because I think you kind of asked for them in your question, one being the rollover benefit of M&A. It was about $200 million of acquisitions during the quarter. That's $135 million of annualized revenue, so the rollover benefits a little south of $100 million to 2023. And then the other point is on the index pricing. And our index pricing, we look at that, that's the 40% mix. And our current projection is that with the puts and takes between what's CPI-based, which what is fixed and what is capped, we think that, that will be at about 5.5% in the year ahead, which is pretty consistent with what we were seeing in the back part of this year. So we're pleased that, that gives us strength going into the rollover of overall core price starting in Q1 of '23.\nMichael Hoffman: So one last piece on that, then what I'm hearing is sales are up, EBITDA are up somewhere in an 8% to 10% zone based on what you just shared. But based on an earlier question about free cash, free cash all-in capital spending, including above-average growth is probably flat to down, given the headwinds?\nDevina Rankin: All-in capital spending is flat to down? Is that what you said or free cash flow?\nMichael Hoffman: All-in -- free cash flow with all-in capital spending, meaning all gross spending, not just normal growth. You're flat to down...\nJohn Morris: Look, I think we'll give a lot more detail here in a couple of months. But to be a surprising but when we come and say free cash flow for 2023 is going to be down all-in versus 2022 because you've got -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we -- the biggest year of CapEx for these RNG plants and for the rebuilds of the recycling plants is going to be 2023. So we're talking about something in the $1 billion of CapEx for those versus $500 million -- $550 million, I think, is the exact number for this year. So it's going to be $450 million or $500 million of additional CapEx just for that. So if we're looking at free cash flow all-in for 2023, it's going to be down.\nMichael Hoffman: I think just everybody needed to understand that directionally, just so there are no surprises, right? You're going to have a great sales EBITDA trend. Free cash is what it is for all the growth, and then I'm going to get a real nice bump in that free cash come '25, '26?\nJim Fish: Yes, that's right. That's right. One quick to what Devina said about -- she talks about index-based pricing. We've said a lot -- several times that because of the 12-month lookback on a lot of these contracts, the two biggest quarters for adjustment will be Q1 and Q2 of 2023. So we are looking forward to that.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes, okay. And then last thing on the RNG just so I understand this. You have shared that in '21, you get about $40 million of contribution from that and then you've added new projects in '22. That $24 million improvement is partly spot market rates plus new or is it all new projects?\nDevina Rankin: No. It's some spot market rate increase. As a reminder, RINs pricing in the first half of '22 was really strong above $3. So there was a big piece of that, that was RINs pricing. There was some that was electricity and then some was incremental contribution from project development.\nMichael Hoffman: And again, managing expectations, I know the $400 million is a good number, no question on that. But it's really weighted heavily back-ended because the bigger -- two bigger driving projects of this are later in the development cycle. You got a whole bunch of little ones early and then a couple of really big ones later. That we should all remember that, right?\nJim Fish: That's right. Look, 2025, for RNG, this thing really takes off like kind of a space show in 2025 because so many projects are coming online in 2024. And a lot of that CapEx is being spent in 2023. So if we think about kind of inflows and outflows of cash, we started it basically in '22, maybe a little bit before. But '22, the big outflow on the CapEx side for RNG plants is in '23. But these things have -- there's a bit of a lag with respect to construction. So a whole lot of those plants, I think 11 to be exact, come online at some point during 2024. Some of them are -- and they're pretty much spread throughout the year. So the big inflows really start in earnest in 2025. And then we get to a full, full run rate in 2026 for RNG. It's a little bit sooner for recycling.\nMichael Hoffman: And then I realize you're still in budgets, Devina, but you shared with us bonus depreciation change like. How do we think about the effective tax rate for next year? Is it up, down, flat?\nDevina Rankin: Effective tax rate, we've guided at around 24.5% generally. I expect it will be a little higher next year. But as we've talked about, I don't have specific.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes, I got it. I just didn't need to directionally tune the model. All right. Thank you very much. Nice job on the price, folks. Keep it up.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nSean Eastman: I wanted to just come back to the sustainability growth investment program, how that translates into EBITDA over the next couple of years. I feel like the discussion with Michael there gave us a good idea on the RNG piece, just as we think about when these projects are kicking in. But then if we move over to the kind of recycling automation side, maybe help flesh that part of it out a little bit. And then even beyond the sustainability element, my understanding is there's another automation bucket in terms of more back office elements. And understanding how that kind of EBITDA benefits flows into the model in terms of timing. Anything around this would be very helpful.\nJim Fish: So I'll take a little bit of it, and then maybe John can add on here, Sean. So you've kind of touched on the strategy there, which is really reducing our labor dependency, taking advantage of the tight labor market and attrition. And so that's one bucket. And we've said that's -- we think that number can be as many as at 5,000 to 7,000 positions, we've gone through what those different buckets are. Some of them come out of recycling. These rebuilds are worth somewhere between 30% and 40% reduction in labor. Most of that, by the way, is third party because a lot of those are pickers on the line, and that's what those are, in large part, third party. But as John talked about, third-party has been a pretty big source of inflation in our cost over the last year. So there's that bucket. There are -- there's our customer experience bucket. By the way, Sean, our card calls are down almost 27% year-over-year. That's a sign of our improving customer service. And so at the same time, we're -- as we've used technology within customer experience, we're just simply not replacing some of these positions. We've had as high as almost 50% attrition in customer experience. And so while we don't like that number, it's an awfully high number, it makes it challenging for our management teams to kind of staff, this is an opportunity for us to use the technology that we put in place to take advantage of that attrition, and we have done that. So by the end of this year, there will be, as I said, about 1,000 jobs that we won't have chosen to replace. And then that goes from 1,000 up to as many as 5,000 to 7,000. That's kind of bucket one. And then we talked a lot about RNG, as you said, and that kind of gave you a bit of a layout there. With the recycling investments, there's really three forms of earnings uplift there. And the earnings uplift comes from the 30% to 40% reduction in labor. It comes from improved quality at the back end of the plant, and then it comes from increased throughput. So as you add all this technology, optical sorting technology, you really start processing a lot more material. One of our big plants in Wisconsin plans on going from 12,000 tons a month to 18,000 tons a month, so the throughput is going up by almost 50%. And as you look at the rollout of that, as I said in my script, we think that the EBITDA pickup is maybe a year sooner than RNG. We think RNG kind of gets to full run rate by 2026. We think it's probably maybe 2025 for these rebuilds. We're kind of rebuilding as quickly as we can. Fortunately, I haven't seen a lot of pressures, John, on the supply chain side for equipment coming in. At the same time, Sean, we're also building some new plants where we have a need. So there's -- and we are taking a sharp pencil of that in today's low commodity price environment. But there are some markets, even with low commodity prices, where we definitely have a need. So I think what you'll see is the big CapEx coming in '23, the EBITDA continuing to show up in '23, but really the big EBITDA bump will come in '24 or '25.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That was very detailed. I really appreciate that and I'll turn it over there.\nOperator: We have a question from Walter Spracklin with RBC. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin: So my question is coming back to -- I know, Jim, you and the team were talking about what you've done within your contracts on the recycling side to limit when commodity prices go down, the negative impact on EBITDA kind of contracts as prices go down, which is great. I'm wondering if there's -- as the industry consolidates, as the desire for recycling goes higher, and Jim, your own comment about getting recycling margins up to more your average margin. And finally, given the increased volatility in your earnings stream associated with commodity prices from recycling and natural gas waste energy conversion, is there anything more you can do with regards to your contracts akin to, say, what a transport company will do with a fuel surcharge and effectively pass the entire price change on to the customers? Is that something you could envision that it will be a pure fee-for-service and you will relinquish or get rid of any of that exposure that you have to commodity prices via some kind of surcharge program that you could adjust in your current pricing? Just curious as to what you're thinking about further changes to contracts that would allow for that.\nJohn Morris: So Walter, we've talked about that a little bit in general, but I think specifically to your question, that's what you're seeing show up in our results. When you look at the numbers I referenced about Q3 to Q3 and Q4 forecast -- Q4 actual and Q4 forecast, a couple of things. One, that business is still generating healthy margins and great returns. We've talked about returns on the recycling business, not just EBITDA margins. And I think the reason why you're seeing that is because we've kind of repriced, if you will, about 85% of our third-party processing agreement. So we've got a little bit of room to go there. And the way we're doing that, you've heard us talk about the revenue structure, but also this battle against contamination and the phases of revenue levers that we've pulled to make sure that folks look at our processing plants is just at a processing facility, where we're going to get paid the process and we're getting a fair restart on top of that before we really start to engage in what the revenue share is. So while none of us are happy about the drop and how precipitous the drop was, I think what we're all taking inventory of is the fact that our recycling business at our MRFs are still producing good returns, good cash flow and margins. And that's why years of conviction about us, in particular, on the automated capital we're going to invest because that's not really commodity-based. That's really driving down OpEx and positioning us, I think, your earlier point, to be able to continue to grow that business even in a down environment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMichael Feniger: Just to clarify, the $50 a ton assumption in Q4, Devina, is that what your basket looks like in October or is that assuming maybe some recovery in November, December to get to that $50 a ton number?\nDevina Rankin: It's a projection of our blend over the three-month period, and there has been basically a continued decline, so we projected that.\nMichael Feniger: And then just on RINs, like I think they're now at 250. So just so we understand the moving pieces there, this was -- it was flat contribution this quarter. It's been a positive on a year-to-date. If RINs stay where they are, Devina and step below the first half of next year, does that mean this is a headwind to EBITDA in 2023 or because of maybe some projects coming on, that offsets that? Just trying to think about the RIN being at 250, and that's below where we saw a very strong RIN in the first half of this year, just to level set what that means for 2023.\nDevina Rankin: That's a great question, and you're thinking about it the right way. Because RINs have come down from the highs we saw in the first half of '22, our current outlook for '23, although preliminary would be that you could have some EBITDA headwind associated 4ertyuioyuiopwith the market prices. The offset, as Jim's talked about, for earnings growth associated with new plants coming online doesn't really start to materialize in any material fashion until more like 2024. So 2023 still meaningfully construction-oriented, not significant impact from new capacity.\nMichael Feniger: And Jim, a while back, you laid out these targets, revenue growth 4% to 6%, EBITDA growth 5% to 7% with a cost inflation of 3 to 4. When you look today with the cost inflation, obviously high, what should we kind of be thinking about these ranges and what cost inflation could kind of look like for 2023, since that cost inflation is one of the factors you were talking about that kind of drives your guys' pricing decisions in the open market?\nJim Fish: Yes, Michael, I mean we're going through that exercise right now, looking to see what costs look like for 2023. We have some pretty aggressive goals we've discussed internally. And I think there's 5,000 to 7,000 positions that we will choose not to refill. With technology, that helps us get there. The pushback on that on the other side is inflation. And so hopefully, we get a little bit of help from inflation that starts to come down. But we do feel like the business can run at a lower cost structure, whether it's an operating cost structure or an SG&A number. When you heard Devina talk about SG&A number for the quarter, which at 9.2%, I don't know that anybody would have thought about that number for a quarter a few years back. And so it's pretty impressive that we're there. Some of that is attributable to some of these positions that have come out. It's a little bit of kind of both categories, OpEx and SG&A, where these positions have come out over 2022. But we do think that cost and cost efficiency is going to be a very important part of our strategy going forward.\nDevina Rankin: And of the three that you articulated, Michael, the most important of those is the EBITDA growth outlook. And if we look at 2022's performance, that traditional range that we guided to of 5% to 7%, we have meaningfully exceeded that in a year where this business grew organically, and it was managing the toughest cost environment that we've ever seen. And so we're really pleased to see EBITDA dollars up 11% in the quarter. So we're revisiting what that long-term range should be.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Dave Manthey with Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Manthey: Sorry, I jumped on the call here a little late. But if you covered these, I can follow up offline. As we're looking down the cost stack here, just a couple of minor questions. You may have commented already, but on hiring and retention, what type of labor inflation are you seeing currently kind of on a per person basis before these productivity-related attrition trends and so forth? Can you just talk about that? And then second, wondering about maintenance and repairs. I'm not sure if you manage that top down or bottom up, but are you seeing any delays there because parts or labor shortages? And any kind of update you can provide on the level of routine maintenance activity today.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. They're great questions. And basically, from a wage inflation perspective, a year ago, we were at around 11%. We've seen that come down to about 7%, so that's that 400 basis point improvement that we're talking about. Very happy to see where we are today, and we think the proactive steps we took a year ago are paying dividends today. On the repair and maintenance side, I would tell you, we manage it both top down and bottom up. We also side to side. We manage it in every direction, and it's something that we have collaborative approaches on across the business. And it's the toughest cost category for us. And it's got a lot of different factors that result in it being so difficult, 1 being delayed trucks, and that's one of the places that we really need to see some traction on, and we're working with the manufacturers to be sure that we get the trucks that we planned for when we expect them. The other things that are happening is technicians in the marketplace are very valuable across the transportation space. And so making sure that we are the preferred employer, it has been a priority. We have made investments there and we'll continue to invest in the future. Aside from that, the things that are really driving increases are commodity-based inflationary pressures that we've seen on lube and parts and supplies. And we are seeing some moderation there that gives us some hope that in 2023, there will be some moderations on the high levels we saw in '22.\nOperator: And there are no other questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back to Mr. Jim Fish for closing remarks.\nJim Fish: Okay, thank you. And I do know that some of our Florida team are on the call listening today, and I just want to let them know how proud of them we are during this recovery from Ian, a tough hurricane particularly with the storm surge coming in as much as it did. And we did lose property. We've talked about that. Our folks lost some property as well. Fortunately, everybody was safe. Everybody on the WM Florida team was safe. And you should all know that we're standing right next to you and standing next to Floridians in general during this recovery. So thank you, though, for your efforts throughout this, particularly there in southwest Florida. Thanks again to everyone for joining us today, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, growing adjusted operating EBITDA by 11% compared to last year. The outperformance is driven by the strength and resiliency of our collection and disposal business. In a quarter where the preponderance of macroeconomic discussion is centered around signs of a slowing economy, WM's collection and disposal operating EBITDA grew by more than 12% and margins expanded 60 basis points. Collection and disposal organic revenue growth was 8.8%, elevating quarterly total revenue -- company revenue to above $5 billion for the second consecutive quarter. The growth was delivered -- excuse me, the growth we delivered was driven by delivered steps to grow revenue and efficiently manage costs, which together, position us to overcome inflationary pressures. Our solid results through the first 9 months of the year position us well to achieve the updated guidance provided last quarter, even with a recent downturn in recycling commodity prices. An important contributor to our improving trend in operating expenses and overall cost structure is the strategic decision to leverage, through automation, the tight labor market and high attrition. John will touch on this as he discusses our significantly improved turnover in more detail. By the end of 2022, we will have reached almost 1,000 full-time positions in difficult-to-source job categories that we've chosen not to refill, putting us well on our way to reducing our labor dependency by 5,000 to 7,000 jobs. We're pleased to see early benefits from our investments to reduce our cost to serve while also differentiating WM by enhancing the customer experience. Continuing on this discussion of our 2023 and beyond strategy, we're very pleased with our investments we're making in both renewable natural gas and recycling businesses. On RNG, we continue to make great progress on building out our new plants as we expect 2023 to be the heaviest capital investment year. We're on track to see meaningful earnings contributions from 2022 and 2023 investments in 2024, with full incremental operating EBITDA contributions coming in 2026, which are conservatively estimated at $400 million. Our recycling business not only provides an important service that our customers want and need, it continues to be a profitable business generating solid returns. We worked hard to adjust our business model over the last several years, and we saw the results of that in the third quarter, particularly in our automated facilities. Our 5 fully automated MRFs are now delivering differentiated results relative to our single stream network, with about 30% lower labor costs, 13% lower total operating costs, nearly double the operating EBITDA margin and most importantly, a 40% improvement in key safety metrics. We're on track to complete four automation projects and add one new MRF in 2022. The significant investments that we're making in growing and automating our MRF network are strengthening the business by reducing costs, increasing throughput and improving product quality. As with our R&D investments, 2023 will be the heaviest year of capital spending, and the rebuilding of our single-stream MRFs was the biggest increase in incremental earnings coming in 2024 and 2025 as the majority of the rebuild and new MRFs come online. Additionally, as part of our commitment to growing our recycling business, we announced that we are acquiring a controlling interest in Avangard Innovative's U.S. business. The planned acquisition will grow our plastics recycling capabilities by delivering circular solutions for films and clear plastic wrap used commercially. We expect to receive investment returns comparable to our recycling automation investments yet on a more prolonged horizon, given that operations are in the early stages of scaling. We plan to provide a more detailed update during our fourth quarter earnings call once the deal closes. Also on the M&A front, we completed more than $200 million of acquisitions in the third quarter, putting us well on our way to our full year expectation of $300 million to $400 million. We closed two nicely-sized solid waste tuck-in acquisitions in Indiana and Arizona during the quarter. These acquisitions are a complement to our existing operations that we expect to generate solid returns and earnings contribution in 2023. And finally, I'm pleased to share that earlier this month, we released our 2022 sustainability report, providing details on our ESG performance and outlining our new 2030 priorities. These new priorities are strongly linked with our overall company strategy and directly support expansion of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Even as we celebrate continued progress in our sustainability journey, we're already focused on driving improvements in the future. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. We're focused on finishing 2022 strong while continuing to progress our investments in recycling, renewable energy and automation to drive growth. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. I think we're tracking still around the midpoint, Tyler. I mean, it is a fairly broad range of $100 million, but we feel pretty comfortable about the midpoint. Some of it obviously depends on what happens in Florida. But for the year, it's going to be a little bit of a positive. I mean -- actually, a little bit of a negative. We were $20 million cost for Q3 and Q4 combined is what we expect it to be. And so right now, we're estimating kind of a $15 million benefit. That will change. And so that's going to help determine where we finish within that $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. So I'd say it's a little bit of a negative. That is based on what we know today, but that number will certainly change. And so that's why we're thinking that the middle of the range is achievable. Obviously, pricing continues to be a key driver for us on the top line. All of the lines of business show really significant price strength. Commercial yield was approaching 10% at 9.81% for industrial, 6.3% resi. So -- and then I guess, 6.5% on the line. I expect that price will continue to be an important driver of our earnings. We've kind of been using price to combat this inflation issue over the last 12 months, and so most of it is really good cost recovery. I'd want to get to a point where price is not just cost recovery but also margin expansion. And I think that's going to be the theme for price going forward. We do expect that inflation will start to come back down a bit in 2023. And so I think we were asked the question last quarter, what's the ideal inflation number. I don't know what the ideal inflation number is, but I said it's not 9%. I know that. And so I think you'll start to see us apply a little bit more price to margin expansion, not just cost recovery, and that's really what it's been. Even with very high price numbers, it's been something that we've had to do in order to cover the cost inflation. I will say this, I think maybe a piece of our earnings and Devina and John have talked about how good solid waste was, but the piece that might have been the most surprising to us was volume really. If you think about collection and disposal volume being positive 1.7%, and there was a little bit of a headwind in there with the hurricane. But still, 1.7% at a time when everybody is speculating about when is the economy going to turn down was really impressive to us. I looked at our numbers this morning. Special waste was still up 50% last week. So our volume continues to be relatively good and that was the positive part for us. I think you -- when we ask why are we seeing that? I think it's probably two things. So even in the face of really pretty heavy pricing, I think we are seeing us continue to take market share. And I also think you're seeing our service show up better than our competition, which is positive for us. So Toni, on the brokerage piece, we've always said that certainly augments what we do in our -- in the piece of the business that we actually process the material. And that's low margin, no capital, but from a return standpoint, it makes a lot of sense and helps us leverage our ability to move all the materials. So we still feel good about that business. From a marginal standpoint, it actually abates from the margin as prices go down. On the traditional side, we've talked about how we protect the business on the downside two ways. One is floor pricing for some of the fiber grades that we have, and that's certainly something we consider when we're talking about the movement in fiber prices and how it affects the overall P&L. The second piece is really what we've done from a fee-for-service model over the last couple of years. And I think the takeaway is, while we're showing some variability and profitability at these prices have taken such a precipitous drop, and it's really mostly the fiber side, the takeaway is the business is still performing well. We're still happy with it. It's making money and it's not changed our long-term view of what we're going to do on the recycling business. I think, Jerry, it's important to point out that this big investment that we announced a couple of quarters ago really is only covering 17 new plants. And we have close to 100, and we discussed this with you when we're on the road, 100 landfills that could go into that bucket. Right now, we're really focusing on just 17. So there's a lot of opportunity to grow the business beyond that. Core -- did you ask as core price peaked? It's a tough question to answer just because I don't know exactly what happens with inflation. But what we did say is we expect inflation probably starts to come back down, which then would imply that core price has peaked. If inflation went to 15%, which nobody expects, then I would tell you the answer is no. So for now, I think you could say that core price has peaked. I think the most important aspect though of pricing is the point that we've made a couple of times, which is instead of just recovering costs, we'd love to be able to have a little margin with price. And for most of 2022, it's been kind of fighting this inflation battle with pricing. Yes, that's right. That's right. One quick to what Devina said about -- she talks about index-based pricing. We've said a lot -- several times that because of the 12-month lookback on a lot of these contracts, the two biggest quarters for adjustment will be Q1 and Q2 of 2023. So we are looking forward to that. That's right. Look, 2025, for RNG, this thing really takes off like kind of a space show in 2025 because so many projects are coming online in 2024. And a lot of that CapEx is being spent in 2023. So if we think about kind of inflows and outflows of cash, we started it basically in '22, maybe a little bit before. But '22, the big outflow on the CapEx side for RNG plants is in '23. But these things have -- there's a bit of a lag with respect to construction. So a whole lot of those plants, I think 11 to be exact, come online at some point during 2024. Some of them are -- and they're pretty much spread throughout the year. So the big inflows really start in earnest in 2025. And then we get to a full, full run rate in 2026 for RNG. It's a little bit sooner for recycling. So I'll take a little bit of it, and then maybe John can add on here, Sean. So you've kind of touched on the strategy there, which is really reducing our labor dependency, taking advantage of the tight labor market and attrition. And so that's one bucket. And we've said that's -- we think that number can be as many as at 5,000 to 7,000 positions, we've gone through what those different buckets are. Some of them come out of recycling. These rebuilds are worth somewhere between 30% and 40% reduction in labor. Most of that, by the way, is third party because a lot of those are pickers on the line, and that's what those are, in large part, third party. But as John talked about, third-party has been a pretty big source of inflation in our cost over the last year. So there's that bucket. There are -- there's our customer experience bucket. By the way, Sean, our card calls are down almost 27% year-over-year. That's a sign of our improving customer service. And so at the same time, we're -- as we've used technology within customer experience, we're just simply not replacing some of these positions. We've had as high as almost 50% attrition in customer experience. And so while we don't like that number, it's an awfully high number, it makes it challenging for our management teams to kind of staff, this is an opportunity for us to use the technology that we put in place to take advantage of that attrition, and we have done that. So by the end of this year, there will be, as I said, about 1,000 jobs that we won't have chosen to replace. And then that goes from 1,000 up to as many as 5,000 to 7,000. That's kind of bucket one. And then we talked a lot about RNG, as you said, and that kind of gave you a bit of a layout there. With the recycling investments, there's really three forms of earnings uplift there. And the earnings uplift comes from the 30% to 40% reduction in labor. It comes from improved quality at the back end of the plant, and then it comes from increased throughput.

And as you look at the rollout of that, as I said in my script, we think that the EBITDA pickup is maybe a year sooner than RNG. We think RNG kind of gets to full run rate by 2026. We think it's probably maybe 2025 for these rebuilds. We're kind of rebuilding as quickly as we can.

So there's -- and we are taking a sharp pencil of that in today's low commodity price environment. But there are some markets, even with low commodity prices, where we definitely have a need. So I think what you'll see is the big CapEx coming in '23, the EBITDA continuing to show up in '23, but really the big EBITDA bump will come in '24 or '25. Yes, Michael, I mean we're going through that exercise right now, looking to see what costs look like for 2023. We have some pretty aggressive goals we've discussed internally. And I think there's 5,000 to 7,000 positions that we will choose not to refill. With technology, that helps us get there. The pushback on that on the other side is inflation.

And so it's pretty impressive that we're there. Some of that is attributable to some of these positions that have come out.

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. As we've seen all year, our team delivered strong results in the third quarter, driven by organic revenue growth, diligent cost management and proactive steps to automate the business. We continue to see improvement in our collection and disposal business as our strategic focuses on fostering a people-first culture and investing in automation are driving nearly tangible results. Adjusted operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew $174 million in the quarter, which contributed to total company operating EBITDA margin expansion of 50 basis points to 28.6%. Performance in the collection and disposal business, net of fuels, drove 120 basis points of margin improvement. Operating EBITDA margins also benefited 50 basis points from the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which secured alternative fuel tax credits through 2024. These 50 basis points relates to the catch-up adjustment we made in the quarter to recognize the benefits of these credits for the first half of 2022. Partially offsetting these very strong results were headwinds of 50 basis points from recycling commodity prices, 30 basis points from the impact of higher fuel costs, 20 basis points from increased technology and automation investments and 20 basis points from damage to some of our facilities and vehicles caused by Hurricane Ian. Proactive management of SG&A continues to be an important element of our business optimization efforts. In the third quarter, SG&A was 9.2% of revenue, a 50 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. Through the first 9 months of the year, SG&A was 9.6% of revenue, which is consistent with the full year outlook we provided last quarter. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations increased more than 4%, driven by operating EBITDA growth of nearly 10%. Cash flow from operations growth is muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, higher bonus payments, a delay in cash benefits from alternative fuel tax credits and some moderation in working capital benefits from last year when we saw significant benefits from our new source to pay system. Through the first 9 months of the year, capital expenditures have totaled $1,725,000,000 with just over $1.4 billion of that related to normal course capital to support the business and the remaining $322 million related to the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. As I mentioned in July, we were starting to see some encouraging signs of improvements in truck deliveries, and we're gaining traction on our sustainability investment project. These early indicators continued throughout the third quarter, and we're pleased with the increased pace of capital investment that our teams have secured. We currently expect this accelerated rate of capital to continue in the fourth quarter, positioning us to finish the year on plan for capital expenditures. Turning to our 2022 outlook. Our solid operational performance in the first 9 months of the year positions us to achieve the guidance we provided last quarter. We continue to expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA within the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion, which represents an operating EBITDA margin of 28.1% at the midpoint. Our operational performance puts us on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance of greater than $2.15 billion. However, in the fourth quarter, we now anticipate making an additional cash tax payment of about $100 million related to a 2017 matter. Considering this payment, we expect 2022 free cash flow of between $2.05 billion and $2.15 billion. When we call all of this together, we're pleased to report results that meet or exceed expectations across all key financial metrics. Combining this strong performance with the stability and certainty afforded by a healthy balance sheet, business confidence in our ability to deliver on strategic priorities through the uncertain economic backdrop. At the end of the quarter, our leverage ratio was 2.65x and 19% of our debt portfolio had variable rates. In conclusion, we are very pleased with the company's performance in 2022. We have strong conviction that the investments we are making in growing our sustainability businesses and in using technology and automation to optimize our business are setting us up for future success. The team remains hard at work on delivering a strong finish to the year and setting a solid foundation for 2023. With that, Katherine, let's open the line for questions. Yes. That's a great question, Tyler. And I think in order to frame it the right way, I'd focus on how we finish 2022, and 2022 has been a fantastic free cash flow year for us. And really, we start that and look at it most importantly on EBITDA strength. When I look at what we expected for the year, we were expecting a $300 million to $400 million increase in EBITDA on a year-over-year basis, and we're going to knock that out of the park and finish the year. We've already achieved $371 million of EBITDA growth through 9 months. And so when you think of the fact that we should deliver another $100 million to $200 million of growth in the fourth quarter, it really does speak to the strength of the year. When we look at the headwinds though for the year ahead, it really is what's creating a little bit of noise in our 2022 free cash flow. Interest and tax is leading the way but there is some working capital noise as well. On the interest and taxes line, we now expect a headwind on a year-over-year basis of about $250 million. We started expecting that headwind to be $75 million to $125 million. And when I look ahead, the fourth quarter payment I mentioned relating to the 2017 matter really doesn't do anything to change the trend of cash taxes. But the trend of cash taxes will be impacted by the step change in bonus depreciation. So there's a 20% reduction in the amount of benefit from bonus depreciation in the year ahead. That will create some sort of impact. I haven't yet quantified that. We'll give you more color on that in the fourth quarter. Interest, on the other hand, will be more significant. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, about 20% of our debt is at floating rate. When I look at that, combined with the rate resets on maturing debt, you've got about $2.2 billion of our debt balances that will be exposed to some rate lease set in the next 12 months. We're currently projecting that could be about $100 million headwind in the year ahead, but more color because, candidly, that number has changed very dramatically in the last three months. Three months ago, I was looking at a $40 million annualized headwind. So to see that move that much in just a 3-month period is quite significant. On the working capital side, through 9 months, we've had a headwind of $22 million from not having cash from the alternative fuel tax credits. Right now, we expect that to normalize. And for '22 to '23, there should be no impact from that whatsoever. On the incentive comp side, that's a headwind this year of about $40 million. Incentive compensation is expected to be higher for '22 performance than it was for '21, so there could be an incremental headwind for that in the year ahead, but I don't have specific amounts to share. All in all, what I would say is the below-the-line headwinds are offset substantially by that growth that we're seeing in the EBITDA of the business, particularly from strong solid waste performance. And as we continue to make capital investments in sustainability businesses, there will be noise associated with what that total free cash flow number looks like over the long term. But we expect to see growth in core solid waste performance that track to those long-term trends and even exceed the long-term trends that we've set forth. I think the other thing I would point out on the margin side, Jerry, is if you look at Q3 of 2022 as a barometer of how we're performing, we talked about solid waste improving on a year-over-year basis by 120 basis points based on where we are today. And the impact from recycling commodity prices being 50 basis points of an offset to that. And we're really happy to say that we delivered 28.6% so I think that's a great indicator of where we're starting '23. And so that's with the headwind of recycling almost fully baked in. And so I think we're set up well with where the pricing levels are today. And then we have continued expectations for price based on the rollover of our index pricing that happened in the first half of '23 that sets us up well there too. Yes, it's a great question. And what we're looking at is the mix of business that we'll have over time. And if we look at our expectations for how this portfolio grows, we could see our renewable energy grow 6x from where it is today. And with that level of growth, we've got to look at this as a portfolio. And the step that we took and that you saw the results of in the third quarter to secure some of this pricing over the long term is an indication of our desire to ensure that we're securing returns as we outlined in our initial expectations. So as Jim mentioned, those are certainly conservative outlooks for how we see this business grow. I won't specifically speak to the terms of the contracts that we have in place. But as we have thought about it, these are on the longer end of what we expect to do. As we manage this portfolio over time, they're more on the 10-year end where we think that we will also be managing things with three- to-five-year contracts as the portfolio grows. Yes. That's one of the key points that Tara and her team keep speaking to us about, that this is not just the transportation part of the market, it's the non-transportation part of the market. And people in public utilities and institutions who are looking to decarbonize are seeing the RINs market as an attractive place to help to achieve their goals and objectives, which I think is speaking to the strong demand and outlook for the years ahead. We do expect the other thing that will help bolster some clarity on the outlook for this business will be the EPA setting rule in Q4. And so hopefully, those things working together will give us better visibility as we set our expectations for the earnings contributions of this business in '23 and beyond, which we'll give you color on in the fourth quarter call. Your point on the conversion of a core price seller to a yield dollar is a great one. And I think it goes to what John was speaking about just recently on customer receptivity rollbacks turn. And we do really think that all of that is being benefited by was a tough operating environment right now and the hard work that the men and women who pick up the garbage for all of our communities every day are doing. It's a tough labor environment. Operators are seeing challenges, and we are differentiating our services and continue to be a go-to service provider. And so when price is most affected in translating to yield, it's when we hold on to existing customers. And because our service levels are differentiated and because small competitors are having a hard time meeting the needs because driver availability has been a challenge, we are holding on to more and more of our customers and differentiating ourselves each day. And I think that, that will continue to be a strength for the business in the year ahead. I think when you think about the solid waste business in isolation that is absolutely correct. We have talked about the recycling line of business and the headwind increase and that will be a drag on margin, particularly in the first half of '23. But I think your overall thesis about pricing and exiting '22 and crossing over into the beginning of '23 is the right one. And the flow-through of that to earnings expansion to Jim's point about wanting to see more of that really start to be more than accretive rather than just covering our cost. I think we'll start to see better traction on that in '23. I'll give you two data points because I think you kind of asked for them in your question, one being the rollover benefit of M&A. It was about $200 million of acquisitions during the quarter. That's $135 million of annualized revenue, so the rollover benefits a little south of $100 million to 2023. And then the other point is on the index pricing. And our index pricing, we look at that, that's the 40% mix. And our current projection is that with the puts and takes between what's CPI-based, which what is fixed and what is capped, we think that, that will be at about 5.5% in the year ahead, which is pretty consistent with what we were seeing in the back part of this year. So we're pleased that, that gives us strength going into the rollover of overall core price starting in Q1 of '23. All-in capital spending is flat to down? Is that what you said or free cash flow? No. It's some spot market rate increase. As a reminder, RINs pricing in the first half of '22 was really strong above $3. So there was a big piece of that, that was RINs pricing. There was some that was electricity and then some was incremental contribution from project development. Effective tax rate, we've guided at around 24.5% generally. I expect it will be a little higher next year. But as we've talked about, I don't have specific. It's a projection of our blend over the three-month period, and there has been basically a continued decline, so we projected that. That's a great question, and you're thinking about it the right way. Because RINs have come down from the highs we saw in the first half of '22, our current outlook for '23, although preliminary would be that you could have some EBITDA headwind associated 4ertyuioyuiopwith the market prices. The offset, as Jim's talked about, for earnings growth associated with new plants coming online doesn't really start to materialize in any material fashion until more like 2024. So 2023 still meaningfully construction-oriented, not significant impact from new capacity. And of the three that you articulated, Michael, the most important of those is the EBITDA growth outlook. And if we look at 2022's performance, that traditional range that we guided to of 5% to 7%, we have meaningfully exceeded that in a year where this business grew organically, and it was managing the toughest cost environment that we've ever seen. And so we're really pleased to see EBITDA dollars up 11% in the quarter. So we're revisiting what that long-term range should be. Yes. They're great questions. And basically, from a wage inflation perspective, a year ago, we were at around 11%. We've seen that come down to about 7%, so that's that 400 basis point improvement that we're talking about. Very happy to see where we are today, and we think the proactive steps we took a year ago are paying dividends today. On the repair and maintenance side, I would tell you, we manage it both top down and bottom up. We also side to side. We manage it in every direction, and it's something that we have collaborative approaches on across the business. And it's the toughest cost category for us. And it's got a lot of different factors that result in it being so difficult, 1 being delayed trucks, and that's one of the places that we really need to see some traction on, and we're working with the manufacturers to be sure that we get the trucks that we planned for when we expect them. The other things that are happening is technicians in the marketplace are very valuable across the transportation space. And so making sure that we are the preferred employer, it has been a priority. We have made investments there and we'll continue to invest in the future. Aside from that, the things that are really driving increases are commodity-based inflationary pressures that we've seen on lube and parts and supplies. And we are seeing some moderation there that gives us some hope that in 2023, there will be some moderations on the high levels we saw in '22."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Exceptional organic revenue growth continued to be a key contributor to our strong results in the third quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 7.1%. Robust core price across every line of business led to third quarter core price of 8.2%, up 70 basis points from the second quarter. We continue to prioritize customer lifetime value in our pricing strategies, and we maintained third quarter churn of 8.7% when adjusted for steps we took to intentionally shed three large unprofitable contracts. We remain focused on disciplined pricing in the fourth quarter, positioning us to achieve our full year revenue growth guidance of about 10%. In the third quarter, volume remained at healthy levels as workday adjusted collection and disposal volume grew by 1.7%, including special waste volume growth of nearly 15%. Commercial volume adjusted for the contract losses I mentioned was 1.4%. We continue to grow volumes as our team's focus on differentiating WM as a preferred service provider. In addition, our teams in Florida are rising to the challenges from Hurricane Ian, taking care of their teammates and communities. While there were increased costs from business disruption and property losses in the quarter related to the hurricane, we are well positioned to handle storm volume as clean-up activity ramped up in fourth quarter. We remain focused on controlling operating costs. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.2% of revenue in the third quarter, in line with prior year. And while we still see high single-digit inflation, our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in the solid waste business improved 70 basis points compared to last year. Over last year, we made significant investments in our people, including proactive wage adjustments, an improved benefit package and increased training. Those investments are paying off as driver turnover improved 410 basis points in the past three months, and sequentially, the rate of increase in labor costs improved more than 400 basis points.  [Indiscernible] repair costs remain elevated and are being impacted by the slowdown in truck deliveries, a tight labor market for technicians and higher cost for parts and third-party services. The impact of higher fuel costs increased operating expenses as a percentage of revenue by 50 basis points. This increase was completely offset by the alternative fuel tax credits realized in the third quarter related to the first half of 2022. While cost inflation appears to be easing, the inflationary environment only serves to reinforce our commitment to using technology and automation to reduce our labor dependency across the business and lower our cost to serve. As Jim discussed, we continue to have strong conviction in our recycling business. While global markets drive the value of recycled commodities, the steps we've taken over the past few years to shift around 85% of our third-party volumes to a fee-for-service model provides protection on the downside. So while there is a level of earnings variability, the recycling business is profitable and generate solid returns in any economic environment. Our blended average commodity rate in the third quarter was about $94 per ton. We are assuming a blended commodity value of about $50 per ton for the fourth quarter of 2022, which compares to $132 in the same quarter of 2021. These recent commodity market moves, combined with persistent cost inflation, are expected to be about a $50 million year-over-year headwind to operating EBITDA in the fourth quarter. We're very focused not only managing costs in recycling business but also investing in automation across our MRF network to structurally lower the cost of processed material and achieve better quality, which further enhances the protections afforded by our fee-for-service model while providing profitability lift even in the toughest markets. In the renewable energy business, we continue to see strong performance with operating EBITDA in the first 9 months growing $24 million. The second of our 17 new RNG plants announced at the beginning of the year is on track for completion at the end of the year and is expected to begin generating revenue in the third quarter following EPA certification to generate RINs credits. In closing, we are very pleased with our third quarter results, and we continue to operate our business with notable focus on disciplined cost control and responsible revenue quality improvements. I want to thank the entire WM team for their invaluable contributions to our success. I will now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Yes. Let me one add there, and that is to give you a little bit of insight into what we've done with these contracts, just to put this in perspective, if -- when the price drops from $110, and this is our bucket of commodities, dropped from $110 to $100, the impact on that is about -- on earnings, it's about $8 million, $8.1 million to be exact. If the price were to drop from $50 to $40, the impact is only about $3 million, a little bit more than, a little maybe $3.5 million. So you can see that as price drops, the negative impact on EBITDA really starts to slow. And that is representative of all the changes we made contractually over the last five years. And to John's point, even with a significant drop-off in price for the third quarter and expecting that in the fourth quarter, too, that we still have the ninth best recycling quarter in our history for Q3. I don't think we would have been saying that five years ago. Yes. I mean, I kind of think of them a little differently. They're such different businesses from a price perspective. I will say this about price in the solid waste business. I feel like there's room for price increases. Jerry, we went for almost 15 years with kind of nothing. I remember talking about 1% price, 1% volume many, many years ago. So the business really went for quite a long time without getting any price increases. And yet now all we're doing is trying to recover this, as I said, this four-year high inflation. I think in the core business, in the solid waste business, you'll continue to see us use price in a significant way to cover cost but also improve margins. At the same time, as John and I have discussed, taking cost out of the organization, taking advantage of this tight labor markets through attrition, we saw a fair amount of that in '22. We'll see more '23 and '24. Yes. I think that was certainly the precipitous drop, particularly in the fiber markets. There's a little bit of lag there so you'd argue there was a little bit of an outsized impact on the quarter. I think what I would point to, Noah, is we looked at the -- not just the sequential but the quarter-over-quarter change in pricing and how that affected the overall EBITDA headwind. And I think what you're seeing is resiliency in the business that we would, to Jim's point, we wouldn't have seen four or five years ago. It's still profitable business. And if you look at kind of the old calculation of what this $10 a ton means, we've certainly separated from that. You can see that in what we did in Q3 and you can see in Q4 going from $130 to $94 produced a $36 million headwind. And for Q4, we're seeing $50 a ton going from $131 to $50 is a $50 million headwind. And as I pointed out, it's still a profitable business. So I think we've achieved a big part of our goal. But specifically on your question, because of the precipitous drop, there's probably a little bit of a lag there. Yes. No, I think -- I don't think it's going to be $100 million. of it is if we had a crystal ball where the price is going to look like. And we have a view of what pricing will do. And I think you'll see a little bit of improvement from Q4 to Q1 and then sequentially throughout the year. The level of improvement is really what is going to drive that answer. But I don't think even in this environment, it's, I think, quite $100 million. Yes. If you look year-to-date and even quarter-over-quarter, you can see the improvement that we've made both in core price and yield. But we didn't talk too much about it but it's a good spot. When we look at a, we're still growing volume in commercial, industrial when you take out a little bit of the noise I mentioned in my prepared remarks. The residential piece, again, we've got a strategy there that we've employed over the last couple of years. But the other thing we look at is obviously what's going on in Net Promoter Score, customer receptivity, the pricing. We're looking at churn. We're looking at holdbacks, and holdbacks actually improved quarter-over-quarter. So all indications are that the pricing activities we,re engaged in. And we've taken a much more strategic look at that over the last handful of years and use some tools that we didn't have a handful of years ago. And I think that's why you're seeing the uplift in pricing performance without really conceding our ability to grow volume and take some share. Look, I think we'll give a lot more detail here in a couple of months. But to be a surprising but when we come and say free cash flow for 2023 is going to be down all-in versus 2022 because you've got -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we -- the biggest year of CapEx for these RNG plants and for the rebuilds of the recycling plants is going to be 2023. So we're talking about something in the $1 billion of CapEx for those versus $500 million -- $550 million, I think, is the exact number for this year. So it's going to be $450 million or $500 million of additional CapEx just for that. So if we're looking at free cash flow all-in for 2023, it's going to be down. So Walter, we've talked about that a little bit in general, but I think specifically to your question, that's what you're seeing show up in our results. When you look at the numbers I referenced about Q3 to Q3 and Q4 forecast -- Q4 actual and Q4 forecast, a couple of things. One, that business is still generating healthy margins and great returns. We've talked about returns on the recycling business, not just EBITDA margins. And I think the reason why you're seeing that is because we've kind of repriced, if you will, about 85% of our third-party processing agreement. So we've got a little bit of room to go there. And the way we're doing that, you've heard us talk about the revenue structure, but also this battle against contamination and the phases of revenue levers that we've pulled to make sure that folks look at our processing plants is just at a processing facility, where we're going to get paid the process and we're getting a fair restart on top of that before we really start to engage in what the revenue share is. So while none of us are happy about the drop and how precipitous the drop was, I think what we're all taking inventory of is the fact that our recycling business at our MRFs are still producing good returns, good cash flow and margins. And that's why years of conviction about us, in particular, on the automated capital we're going to invest because that's not really commodity-based. That's really driving down OpEx and positioning us, I think, your earlier point, to be able to continue to grow that business even in a down environment."

Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The strength and resiliency of our business was clearly on display in the second quarter as we built on our first quarter momentum to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our teams remain focused on recovering inflationary cost pressures with our strongest-ever core price yield results. Our pricing results, combined with volume growth and sustainability contributions, drove quarterly revenue above $5 billion for the first time. Our robust revenue growth translated into operating -- into adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7.8%, which is above the upper end of our long-term growth profile of 5% to 7%.  Cash from operations remained strong in the second quarter, positioning us to return more than $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders to bring the year-to-date total of shareholder returns to more than $1 billion. You'll hear more details from Devina, but our strong start to the year gives us confidence to increase our 2022 outlook for revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong volumes, an encouraging sign for economic activity across the areas we serve.  Currently, our key business indicators point to continued positive economic activity. That said, WM is well positioned in any economic environment. Our resilient business model is underpinned by our diverse customer base and essential nature -- the essential nature of our service and the annuity-like characteristics of about 75% of our revenue.  We continue to advance our long-term strategic priorities of providing the best workplace for our employees, investing in technology and automation that differentiates WM and permanently reduces our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Investing in making WM a great place to build a career while also reducing our labor dependency through attrition and automation together position us to navigate this tight labor market.  In our sustainability growth journey, we achieved 2 exciting milestones in the second quarter. We opened our fifth WM owned and operated RNG plant in Oklahoma, the first of the 17 new RNG facilities we announced, that are expected to add 21 million MMBtu of RNG to our renewable energy portfolio by 2026. We expect to complete construction on the next RNG facility by the end of the year.  On the recycling front, we brought online our Houston MRF, the sixth redesigned recycling facility utilizing advanced technology to reduce labor and improve product quality. Our advanced technology MRFs are yielding tangible benefits, resulting in about a 30% labor cost savings per ton compared to the rest of the single-stream network.  In the second half of the year, we expect to open 2 additional advanced technology recycling facilities and enter a new recycling market, keeping us on track to meet our recycling investment goals.  I want to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities, particularly related to M&A. Our strong operating EBITDA growth has allowed us to absorb the $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal and quickly return our balance sheet to pre-ADS leverage levels. We consider a typical M&A year to be between $100 million and $200 million of acquisitions. This year, we have the strongest pipeline we've had in a long time and expect to close between $300 million and $400 million of acquisitions.  We will remain disciplined in our approach to traditional solid waste tuck-in and recycling acquisitions to maintain our strong financial position and generate industry-leading returns. Our cash generation plus our strong balance sheet affords us the ability to allocate capital to our priorities, investing in organic growth and sustainability initiatives, predictably growing our dividends, completing accretive acquisitions and returning cash through share repurchases.  In conclusion, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I'm excited about the remainder of 2022 as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our team members, customers, communities and shareholders.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Once again, we achieved exceptional organic revenue growth in the second quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 6.2%. Our pricing accelerated sequentially as we continue to address persistent inflationary cost pressures throughout the business.  Second quarter core price increased 20 basis points from the first quarter to a record 7.5%. Core price was strong across every line of business, and we had standout performance of 10.6% in our industrial business and 9.4% in our commercial business. Customer receptivity to our pricing remains strong as second quarter churn, adjusted for the intentional loss of an unprofitable national account contract, was 9%. We remain confident that our pricing strategies are appropriately responsive to rising costs while prioritizing customer lifetime value. Our teams continue to be focused on disciplined pricing in the second half of the year, and we now expect 2022 core price of more than 7% and collection and disposal yield approaching 6%.  Key indicators in our business continue to signal healthy economic activity in the quarter. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.3% with commercial volumes growing 1.6% and special waste volumes up more than 19%. Additionally, new business exceeded lost business as service increases continue to outpace service decreases by a wide margin. Second half volumes are expected to remain strong and for the full year, we expect collection and disposal volume growth of about 2.5%. Our teams remain focused on controlling operating cost. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.4% of revenue in the second quarter, a 130 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was largely driven by fuel and commodity price impacts, 70 basis points from higher fuel costs, 30 basis points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022 and 30 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business.  In the second quarter, we again saw high single-digit inflation in our costs, and we are managing through this with both pricing and cost controls. Our core price is recovering our cost of inflation in each line of business, except residential, where the impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced. In that line of business, our conversion of approximately 2,000 railroad routes to automated side loaders will both reduce labor and significantly improve efficiency. This is one of the ways where we are investing in technology to reduce our dependency on certain high-turnover positions.  Additionally, early results from our pilot programs to fully optimize our roll-off routes are showing efficiency gains in the range of high single to low double-digit percentage increases. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect inflationary cost pressures to ease on a year-over-year basis given the proactive steps we took to raise frontline wages in the second half of 2021.  As Jim mentioned, we're excited about growth opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, and both businesses continue to deliver strong results. Together, recycling and renewable energy contributed $19 million of operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter. The recycling business is on track to deliver results on par or modestly higher than the record earnings we achieved in 2021. Our blended average recycling stream commodity price was $131 per ton in the second quarter, and we continue to expect a full year average of $125 per ton.  In the renewable energy business, better pricing for renewable natural gas, electricity and environmental credits is driving our full year outlook for this business higher than our original guidance by $35 million to $45 million. Overall, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as we demonstrated our ability to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and manage costs.  I'm extremely proud of having the entire WM team work together to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. The strong operating and financial results of the second quarter confirmed a number of important indicators we saw emerge in Q1, positioning us to increase our full year financial outlook. I'll cover our updated guidance in a moment, but I want to give a little more color around our second quarter and year-to-date financials first.  As John discussed, our results have been driven by robust organic growth, led by our disciplined pricing focus as well as diligent cost management. Proactive management of our SG&A has been an important element of those cost management efforts. In the second quarter, adjusted SG&A was 9.4% of revenue, a 20 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. We accomplished this result in spite of an increase in incentive compensation due to our focus on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the customer sales and back office functions. We are on track to deliver SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 9.6% for the full year.  Operating EBITDA increased more than $100 million in the second quarter, driven by an increase in the operating EBITDA of our collection and disposal business of $107 million. Operating EBITDA margin in the quarter was 28.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2022. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year margin outlook, which is a particularly strong result given the dilutive impacts from rising fuel costs, which we now estimate could be about 60 basis points for the year.  Year-to-date cash flow from operations was up $142 million or about 6.5% from the prior year, which has been driven by operating EBITDA growth of over 9%. Cash flow from operations growth was slightly muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, which will continue throughout the year, and working capital pressure that we expect to moderate over the remainder of the year.  During the first half of the year, we've invested $856 million in capital to support the business, and we invested an additional $112 million to support the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Our year-to-date free cash flow, which includes the impact of capital outlays to support our sustainability growth investments, is $1.35 billion, putting us on pace to exceed the upper end of our initial 2022 guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion.  While the pace of capital spending has been slower than expected in the first half of 2022, we currently expect truck deliveries, landfill construction and sustainability capital projects to ramp in the second half of the year. We're encouraged to see supply chain constraints in certain asset categories begin to show promising signs of improvement, though we are proactively managing the business in anticipation of the longer delivery schedules we've experienced over the last year. We will revisit capital and free cash flow guidance in more detail next quarter.  As Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate free cash flow among all our capital allocation priorities. In addition to increased acquisition expectations for the year, we now expect to allocate our full $1.5 billion authorization to share repurchases.  Turning now to our updated 2022 guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. The $175 million increase in operating EBITDA guidance is driven by more than $325 million from increased price and volume performance and $40 million from better performance in the renewable energy business. Those things are partially offset by approximately $190 million of higher costs, which were driven by a combination of inflation pressure and incentive compensation.  Note that this outlook assumes fuel prices remain at June levels for the second half of the year, equating to a 60 basis point drag to full year operating EBITDA margin. Even still, we expect to deliver margin of 28.1% at the midpoint of our guidance.  We remain optimistic that the alternative fuel tax credits will be approved in 2022 and continue to include the approximately $55 million benefit we would expect to receive in our outlook.  In closing, our excellent first half performance sets us up to deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2022. I can't thank the WM team enough for all their contributions to our success.  With that, Valerie, you let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Tyler Brown of Raymond James.\nPatrick Brown: You guys threw out quite a bit in the prepared remarks, but I just want to make sure I have it. So on the down 120 basis points on the margin walk, it was 70 basis points from fuel, 30 from the CNG credit and 30 from commodities. Is that right?\nDevina Rankin: That's right. And that's looking at the operating expense line, so we would also -- for the EBITDA margin, and I think it's important in thinking about EBITDA margin in 2 pieces. So one is how did we perform relative to the expectations that we laid out at the beginning of the year. And what we can say there is that we're extremely pleased. And really, our outperformance relative to expectations is in 2 places, and that's our traditional solid waste business that outperformed expectations by about 40 basis points and the renewable energy business that outperformed expectations by 20 basis points.  As we've mentioned, we've had a couple of headwinds relative to our initial expectations, and those headwinds are fuel and the alternative fuel tax credits as well as incentive compensation. But when we put all of that together and think about our outlook for the full year and our performance in the first half, particularly relative to our original guidance, we can say that we're 60 basis points ahead of expectations on base performance, and that's a really strong outlook.  When we look at Q2 specifically, the walk forward between the 29.3% that we achieved in Q2 of '21, which I'll remind everyone, is the best quarterly performance that we've had in our history from a margin perspective, to what we delivered at 28.1% today for Q2, really, fuel is the story there in terms of that walk forward.  So what you saw in that 120 basis points is 80 basis points led by fuel. And that 80 basis points is 50 basis points from higher fuel costs, 30 basis points from the alternative fuel tax credits. Recycling was 40 basis points negative, that was in line with expectations. 30 basis points of that is from the brokerage business that we talk about, where it's effectively pass-through revenue. So higher commodity prices just translates into pretty much a dollar-for-dollar increase in cost. And then the other piece of that was higher incentive compensation cost at 30 basis points.  So really happy with the strong performance of the solid waste business, and I think that's the highlight when you look at the margins for the business in the quarter.\nJames Fish: That's why she's the CFO, Tyler.\nPatrick Brown: Yes, I was going to say that was extremely helpful, very detailed. So real quickly, not to focus too much on the margins, but it does feel like you're looking for a margin uplift in the back half, I think, somewhere circa, call it 50 basis points. But I just want to kind of think about it conceptually. So is it that the pricing contribution will kind of hang around the same place, but your unit cost inflation kind of eases? Because I think John talked about it, you pulled some frontline wages, I believe, forward in the back half of '21. Is that kind of how that will work?\nJames Fish: Yes, I think that's right, Tyler. I mean, listen, we got out from the labor issue kind of Q2, Q3 last year. So we feel like while we're still seeing labor inflation, it's not going to be at the same rate. And there's other obviously inflationary pressures, but I think you got it right.\nPatrick Brown: Okay. Great. And just my last one, John, just real quick. Can you remind us what percent of your revenue is, call it, temporary roll-off in C&D landfill volumes? Just I've been getting some questions about housing, just kind of your exposure there.\nJohn Morris: Yes, we're not really exposed too much there, Tyler. The temp C&D business is low single digits.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Nice quarter. I'm wondering if we could trouble you just for an update on how pricing is tracking now that your landfill gas facilities are coming online. Jim, how are you feeling about the pricing point relative to the mid-20s that you underwrote the investments in? And is the offtake market developing?\nJames Fish: So I thought you were going to go down to the solid waste pricing path. But on RNG, look, I think our expectation here is that -- we built in $2.80, Jerry, for the back half of the year. We think that's pretty comfortable. As you know, based on our discussions, and we're with you that the business was pro forma-ed at much lower numbers. And even at those lower numbers, $2 for RIN and $2.50 in natural gas, even at those lower numbers, this is an outstanding business in terms of the returns. But specifically for the back half of '22, our expectation is that we'll see $2.80 in RIN pricing, and we feel comfortable with that number.\nJerry Revich: And Jim, in terms of the offtake market, is that developing? What's your level of inbounds for folks that are looking to lock in long-term agreements? And can you comment on how those conversations are going?\nJames Fish: Yes, Jerry. I would tell you that we're obviously -- the RIN market is what it is, and that's a part of our portfolio. But we have started to become -- and I think last quarter or the quarter before, started to do some direct offtakes for renewable natural gas. And we're seeing good momentum in some of those contracted rates.\nJerry Revich: Okay. Super. And Jim, since you want to talk about it, the solid waste pricing. Can we talk about that? So big CPI tailwind into next year, obviously positive revision to pricing over the course of this year. As you look at the book of business today, what's your best sense for how pricing might look in '23? It feels like just with CPI pricing rolling and the timing of C&I increases, you probably have 5 points of core price already in your back pocket entering '23. But I'm wondering if you could comment on that.\nJames Fish: Well, you're absolutely right, Jerry, about the tailwind on those businesses that are driven by an index-type increase. The 12-month lag that we've talked a lot about really starts to help us most significantly in the first quarter of next year.  So if we believe that CPI has gotten pretty close to the top here at 9.1%, then we would see pricing -- let's just assume for the sake of discussion that inflation starts to taper back down. I think you'd see pricing in those open market businesses follow that down but not exactly. I think we've kind of talked about it compared to banks, for example, where their spreads are better at lower rates. And I think that's what you would see with our pricing is that if inflation starts to really taper back down, that you'd see a bigger percentage of our price go to margin improvement, not just cost recovery. Right now, we're kind of in a street fight trying to cover costs at 9.1% CPI.  And then with respect to your initial question, yes. When we get to really the first half of 2023, and recall that what we said about those index-driven price increases is that -- about 70% of that takes place in the first half of every year and 30% takes place in the second half of the year. So we will see some tailwind in the second half of 2022 from CPI, but it's just not as pronounced because only 30% of the revenue is getting it.  When we get to the first half of 2023 is when we get the real tailwind in -- it's primarily residential because that's the line of business that is most tied to an index.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman of Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: Jim, I'd like to follow-up on the price conversation because I think this is one of the most critical issues the industry has going for it. So tackling what you just said and summarizing it, you're about 60-40 open market versus index, and I get the weighting first half, second half. But if CPI goes to 3%, you're still going to get a good spread to it, call it 100, 150 basis points in your open market. And then you're going to have your index at an 8-something, maybe closer to 9%. In just the algebra formula, there is a greater price in '23 than I am in '22 before I factor in churn. That's the math, right?\nJames Fish: I think you're spot on, Michael. I mean, look, we're not crazy about 9.1% inflation. And as I said, we're doing everything we can with price and doing a good job with it, but to cover our cost. If inflation comes back down to a more reasonable number, let's call it 3% over the next kind of 2 to 3 quarters, then I think we have a greater percentage of our price that actually goes to margin improvement and not just focused on cost recovery, which is kind of where we are today with the open market pricing.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. And so I was thinking -- go ahead, John, sorry.\nJohn Morris: I was just going to say, Michael, I think the one caveat to that is what we're specifically doing in residential. And you can see that we continue to make progress on the core price side and the yield side, and we're still being pretty deliberate about what volume we're going to keep and what volume we're not going to keep. That would be the one caveat to what Jim commented on.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. And I get that, and I keep trying to convince the market you're supposed to pay attention to price, not volume, because at the end of the day, you'll have a better quality business.  So the other part of the price question that keeps coming up and we try to help the market understand is how sticky unit prices are. So the rate of change in open market might go from a 7 core to a 5 core, but the underlying unit prices are very, very sticky, price per yard, price per ton, price per pull. Can we help everybody appreciate the significance of that as well?\nJohn Morris: We consider our business to be very price-inelastic. And the reason is that it's such a small percentage of the customer's overall cost structure. I mean, we've estimated it differs a little bit whether you're a residential customer versus a business customer, but it's probably 0.5% of a small business' overall spend. And then when you add to that what we're doing to truly differentiate ourselves, those 2 things cause pricing to be pretty darn sticky for us. So you're right. It is -- we tend to hold on to more of it than maybe other businesses might.\nJames Fish: Right. And my point being is if all of this unwinds from an inflationary standpoint or there's a recession, you don't walk back unit prices. You hold on to the unit price, plus I've got the favorable trend of higher price versus underlying internal cost of inflation in '23. The power of that is pretty compelling.\nJohn Morris: Yes. No, that's right. I mean, the unit price stays where it is. And then it's just about the percentage, which is yield or core price. Those are percentage growth figures. And we think that the percentage growth figure, as I've said, does kind of taper down as inflation comes down, but the spread improves a bit. So we have a little bit more that goes towards margin improvement at 3% CPI than we do at 9.1% CPI.\nMichael Hoffman: The RIN recycling upside of $35 million to $45 million, I'm assuming that's mostly all weighted in the first half because the RIN's coming down, recycling's come down sequentially. And so the benefit of that has already been captured.\nDevina Rankin: So I'll take that in 2 pieces, Michael. On the recycling side of the business, we were better in the first half about $28 million. We expect actually to give some of that up in the second half of the year. So we expect about $20 million to $25 million of earnings pressure in the second half just because of where commodity prices were in the second half of '21 relative to what we expect them to be in the second half of '22.  On the renewable energy side, we have captured $27 million in the first half of '21 -- or '22, and we expect another $10 million to $20 million of incremental earnings in the back half. So when you net those 2, we expect to be down in the, call it, $10 million to $15 million range.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. That's very helpful. And then Devina, on the guide at the beginning of the year, you framed it as negative 100 basis points of headwind. First half, plus 100 to 140; second half, sort of 0 to 40 up. You were actually pretty close to the negative 100, a little less actually. But you're now telling us it's less than positive 100, 140 in the second half. That's if we're revising part of the messaging, that's the other part of it?\nDevina Rankin: That's right. But what I would say is the plus 100 to plus 140 now looks more like, call it, plus 80 to plus 120. And when you consider the impact of fuel at 60 basis points, that really does speak to the strength of the underlying fundamentals of solid waste and the incremental benefit of the renewable energy business relative to our initial expectations.\nMichael Hoffman: Fair enough. And just to be clear, that 60 basis points is just a pass-through math. It's not a real cost impact. It's -- you offset the cost increase with the surcharge, and it's just the pass-through math.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, that's right. From an earnings perspective, you'll really -- should be a zero-sum game for us. What we see on the fuel surcharge side of revenue growth, what we had in Q1 -- or Q2, I'm sorry, was $129 million. We expect similar levels, maybe a moderate decrease in the second half of the year on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But that effectively is a dollar-for-dollar offset as higher operating costs, both for direct fuel and our indirect costs from subcontractor costs and other transfer elements of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: My first question is just maybe you could frame for us how this business you think will perform in a new recession. I know the business is pretty resilient. I know most companies are not seeing a downturn either yet, but -- just the reason I ask that question is the sector is pretty different from '09, when volumes fell 10% and it took a lot longer to recover.  And then most investors kind of have the COVID year in front of them, where your internal revenue growth, I guess, was negative 3%. That was more of a shock to the system. But just frame for us how your business is different. We're clearly seeing pricing, how the sector is more disciplined. Just frame for us your downturn playbook and just resiliency of this business. I know it also lags going into a downturn.\nJames Fish: Thanks, Hamzah. So you really kind of talked about it, primarily volume, right? But there's a couple of different components to your question here. I'll tell you what gives us cause for optimism here. We knew that 99% of the focus on this call is going to be about forward-looking statements. So a couple of things. First of all, I mentioned that on the price side, we -- to Michael's question, we have a very price-inelastic customer base. That's a real positive in terms of the stickiness of price, and price is one of the big 3. If I think of the big 3 being price, volume and cost control, we feel really good about price.  If we think about volume a little bit, and so just maybe a little bit of inside baseball here. We just had our 16 area vice presidents on for their quarterly reviews, and almost to a person, they're feeling really optimistic about their own individual areas. And when we look at our July numbers in terms of volume, they look pretty good. I mean, they look basically exactly like we saw in June. You have to kind of consider that we had 1 less work day. Fourth of July this year was on Monday, last year was on Sunday. So there's a little bit of -- we have to consider that. And we also are, on the commercial side, considering things like we intentionally shed a big national account that affected us by almost 1 percentage point.  And -- but if we factor those onetime things out, volume still looks pretty good. And the most forward-looking component of our volume is special waste. It was up 19% for Q2. But as we look out towards what the pipeline is telling us in -- for the remainder of the year, it still looks really good. Our volume in the first 3 weeks of July looks good in that special waste stream. So that's 2 of the big 3 there.  And I would also tell you, Hamzah, to your question about why we're different from other industries. I don't know that we're different from other industries necessarily. But our company, we do believe that we're starting to take some share. It's a tough operating market, a really tough operating market for a lot of companies. John talked a bit about this labor shortage, and I don't think that's a short-term trend. That is a long-term trend. That's why we've talked about kind of the third of the big 3, which is cost control and taking advantage of the attrition in our business, the cost categories that we're looking at, not backfilling for have -- some of them have 50% turnover.  So why go through that hamster wheel every single day? Why not use technology to let some of those jobs have attrit away and actually use that to our benefit? And the -- most other companies out there in our space just don't have the technology or the wherewithal.  So some of this that ultimately makes us look better even in a recessionary environment is that we feel good about taking share in a tough operating climate.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Very helpful. And just you had flagged an above-normal M&A year. I know it's still sort of $300 million, $400 million figure. But just maybe frame for us, what's driving that? How long do you think an above-normal M&A environment could last? And any change in valuations you're seeing in the private market?\nJames Fish: Yes. So I just talked about the fact that it is a bit of a tough operating environment out there for a lot of companies. And so what we don't want to do and we've said this on several of our previous calls, we don't want to bail somebody out of a problem. I mean, we're still going to be conservative when it comes to valuations.  But we think there's some really good companies out there that are not asking for ridiculous prices, purchase prices, and those are attractive to us. And we see enough of those to say that in the solid waste space and in the recycling space, we feel more like a $300 million to $400 million a year versus more of our traditional $100 million to $200 million is appropriate.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. Just a clarification question and I'll turn it over, just for Devina. I think you had flagged $129 million sort of out of the $153 million that's fuel surcharge recovery in Q2. Just comparing that number, did you mention sort of how much fuel increased for you, when we're looking at that $129 million number? What did your cost increase for fuel just comparing the $129 million? Was it over $100 million or less than $100 million? Just any sense there.\nDevina Rankin: It was effectively equal. So it was a combination of direct fuel and indirect. So the indirect will show up in lines like the subcontractor category. So you can think of it effectively like a dollar-for-dollar offset.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital Markets.\nSean Eastman: I just wanted to come back to inflation. Last quarter, you guys quoted, I think, around 9%. Wondering what that was in the second quarter. And just this dynamic around comping the heavy wage increases. Last year, it was interesting how we think about how that part of the inflation algorithm trends into the second half.  But what else should we be aware of in terms of what's happening under the hood in terms of inflation? I mean, outside of wages, are things still ramping, cooling off? Any color on that element would be helpful.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Sean, I think the commentary on labor, we got out front of it last year. And we see, while it's not going all the way down, it's going to moderate in the back half of the year because of the intentional steps we took last year. Devina touched on it, but we're still seeing inflationary pressure on third party on maintenance and repair. Subcontractors is one that sticks out.  And clearly, whether it's by rail or by truck, we're seeing the fuel impact there as well. That's a big chunk of the indirect pressure we're seeing. And I think the commodity piece runs through that a little bit as well. When you think about third-party maintenance and repairs, there's a commodity element to that.  So I would tell you that I feel like it's peaked, generally speaking. And I think the benefit we'll see is in terms of what we did with our labor, which is a big chunk of our operating expense line.\nJames Fish: I do think, Sean, that Devina touched on it in her remarks. But the supply chain itself, I mean, she mentioned that we're seeing a little bit of easing there, and that is true. But that's pretty important to us, particularly as you think about the delivery of trucks to us. I mean, last year, we didn't get the trucks that we ordered. And so far this year, we have not gotten to the number that we expected. We're hopeful that in the back half of the year, we start to see a pretty significant ramp-up there in the vehicles that we've ordered. That's a pretty important part of the inflation picture because, as John mentioned, maintenance cost is not insignificant as a cost line item. And that obviously is impacted as you're having to keep older trucks in the fleet.\nSean Eastman: Okay. That's interesting and kind of a segue into my next question. I think in the prepared remarks, you guys had mentioned that capital spending is running a little below expectations in the first half. Maybe you'd revisit that guidance next quarter. I mean, is it really just trucks we're talking about here? I wondered if some of these capital spending delays also are being seen around the sustainability investment program. And whether there's any risk to that incremental EBITDA we're expecting to see roll out of those investments into next year.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, great question, Sean. First and foremost, I would say it's important to hear the message that we are very confident with the rollout of our sustainability initiatives, and those investments are on track. We talked about both the renewable energy facility and the recycling facility coming online and expectations for the remainder of the year there. It continue to be strong relative to our initial expectations. So when we look at capital being below our guided levels, it really is more in the traditional solid waste space and specifically for trucks.  As Jim just mentioned, our truck deliveries in 2022 has really been slow relative to our initial expectations. And even after we saw Q1 unfold, we revised those expectations, and they're still below what we had expected at that point in time. So as we look at how we spend our capital, we're adapting for that slowdown on the truck front. And we're looking at places across the rest of our business to proactively pull forward capital, whether it be in the landfill line of business where we've seen strong volumes, particularly in special waste, or as we look at other parts of the business that are performing well and have continued investment opportunities because those returns have been strong.  So overall, what I would tell you is we still need Q3 to unfold before we can give you the additional detail on the traditional capital part. I would tell you, at this point, we completely expect to stand firm on the sustainability capital at about $550 million for the year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: Actually, that last question really feeds into what I wanted to ask about, which is kind of the medium to longer-term planning for some of the investments that, Jim and John, you've talked about in terms of ramping up ASL's percentage within the fleet, of course, the recycling automation. But just generally, these investments that are helping to reduce your labor intensity, can you kind of outline for us? You talked about where you want to be in 4 years. How should we think about maybe the next couple of years? Hopefully, you put some of these supply chain constraints behind us. But can you just talk maybe about 24 to 48 months -- sorry, a 12- to 24-month type expectation for where you think you can get to?\nJames Fish: So I think that what you're talking about, your question is really around -- is it where we expect to be with respect to capital? Or is it about what we think the impact will be from an operating standpoint by not backfilling some of these roles? Just so we're clear.\nNoah Kaye: It's both, right, because we understand that one will follow the other. So...\nJames Fish: Okay. So let's talk about the capital piece first. And if I just think about kind of the big buckets around where -- I've talked about 5,000 to 7,000 positions that we wouldn't refill. The big bucket's, as John mentioned, shifting from a rear-load truck to an ASL truck. There's about -- if you think about a rear-load being maybe a $280,000, $300,000 truck and ASL is maybe $100,000 more, so there is some additional capital going to an ASL. But really, if you think about that, that pays itself off in almost in 1 year's time because you're taking a helper off the back, and you're picking up a pretty significant chunk of productivity there.  We've done this many times, moving from rear-load to ASL, and the pickup in efficiency is about 15%. And then you take a helper off the back, the all-in cost of -- a lot of those are actually temp laborers. So we're paying a temp firm, might be $75,000 to $100,000 all in for that person on the back of the trucks. So it pays itself back almost in a year's time. That's bucket one. So there is some additional CapEx for the truck, but the OpEx goes away pretty fast.  If we think about another bucket, we've talked a lot about recycling. And we've said kind of somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions there as we -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've seen 30% reduction in the labor cost at those first 5 that we've done. And we think it's anywhere between 30% and 50% reduction. So one of the plants that we rebuilt was in Salt Lake City. That one actually was closer to 50% reduction in labor.  So it's a range of how much labor comes out and the capital is already accounted for. We've already talked about the $800 million-ish over a period of 4 years, that's in that number. And then we also, in recycling, gets an improved quality of the material at the back end of the plant, and that doesn't show up in -- that shows up in top line revenue. Use Salt Lake as an example there. Previously, before we rebuilt the plant, they were having to sell all their mixed paper as a low-grade paper. Now they're able to separate it. And they have a pretty big component of the high-grade paper that obviously comes at a higher price.\nJohn Morris: The only thing I would add to what Jim has already said is we're taking kind of a total cost of operation view. Residential is a good view of that between capital and OpEx. And I would tell you, the other thing that's happening is when we started down this past few years ago, recycling and residential are 2 good examples. Kind of the calculus we were doing then, in this labor inflationary environment, those are actually -- those investments are getting better as we go along. As Jim mentioned, I don't think any of us think this labor shortage or the labor wage pressure is going to abate anytime soon. So as we continue to invest, these pro formas actually look better as time goes on.\nJames Fish: Yes. So to kind of complete the answer there -- and good color, John. Thank you. It is -- what do we expect this impact to be? I mean, look, put a number on -- put whatever number you want on those 5,000 to 7,000 positions that don't get refilled. The good news is that this is not your traditional, okay, we're going to rip 10% of the workforce. That's not at all what this is. This is a very strategic approach to reducing our labor dependency by taking advantage of these very high-turnover numbers in some of these jobs.  And so the cost of -- the exit cost is just very low. The capital cost is largely accounted for. And the operating improvements, whether it's SG&A or operating cost, if it's 5,000 jobs, let's put a number on that of $50,000 to $100,000 per, it's a big -- it's a material impact to OpEx and to SG&A. If it's at the higher end of that job range, 7,000, then it becomes even better.\nNoah Kaye: Yes. That's great color. Just wanted to get a little bit of color as well on the M&A pipeline, and good to see you coming back in greater force to the market. But is this primarily traditional solid waste? Is it recycling? Can you give us a sense of the mix in terms of where you're seeing the opportunities?\nJames Fish: It's a little bit of both. I mean we kind of consider -- we consider recycling to be traditional solid waste, but it's a bit of both. We announced the continuous investments last quarter or a couple of quarters ago and which is taking low-value plastics that we weren't getting paid a lot for and some of those mixed papers that I mentioned that are low value as well, and combining them and making a roofing material.  And so there's a little bit of both in this. How do we take material that is, for example, coming into the landfill today that really doesn't add a lot of value, that maybe is light? I mean if I'm thinking about plastics, plastics are very light, but plastics are also very recyclable. And so it's -- we're already doing everything we can with things like PET and HDPE, going through a traditional single stream. Are there other things we can do with plastics that come into the landfill? Taking them out of the landfill, where it doesn't decompose for 700 years or something, and doing something that's both environmentally and economically favorable to the existing model.  And then you're right, the other piece is just very traditional solid waste acquisitions, tuck-ins, that -- where we may have kind of a hole in our network or we've got something that feels like it's -- it would be additive and makes a lot of sense for us at a reasonable valuation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin of RBC.\nWalter Spracklin: So I'd like to keep on the M&A front. You're doing 2x to 3x this year what you would do in a normal year. When you look at the addressable market for acquisitions and look at what's not held by the majors, do you see that entire market as being in your sights? Or would you consider some lower portion of that as being where you would focus your attention over the coming -- and I'm not saying this year, over the coming 5, 10 years in scope?\nJames Fish: I guess if we're talking geography, we're a North American company. So we really haven't looked outside of North America for a big -- for any type of solid waste acquisition. Obviously, that doesn't meet the definition of a tuck-in anyway because we don't have operations overseas. So yes, within North America, when we look at these acquisitions, we're always looking at where it makes the most sense strategically for us and where we can bring it -- by the way, Walter, it's part of what -- of why we're excited about the -- this reduction in labor dependency.  It enables us -- if we believe that our competition can't do the same thing, that they're not able to use technology to reduce their labor dependency, then it gives us the ability to bring more synergies to the table when we acquire a company. So I think we're -- everything would be on the table within North America. And then, of course, if it requires a filing of some type, then we'll have Justice look at it. But we always feel like we want to be conservative on valuations, and that's maybe the single most important piece is does it meet our strategic goals? And is it valued properly?\nWalter Spracklin: I guess, not only does it bring in more synergies, Jim, it also makes it harder for those mom-and-pops to compete with you and perhaps drive more to you, given that they can't match your technological investment. Is that fair to say?\nJames Fish: Yes. Look, I mean, it's -- I don't think it's against the rules to say that trying to reduce our cost structure is something that's very important to us. And to the extent that somebody else can't do that, that's their problem, not ours. I mean -- but it does present an opportunity. It's why we're seeing a pretty robust pipeline here.  I think there's a lot of companies out there that say, look, I'm not going to -- I don't want to be an HR coordinator 24/7. And I don't want to make the investments in technology to try and do the same thing that WM is doing, so I'll turn around and sell to them at a reasonable valuation. And that's okay.\nWalter Spracklin: That makes sense. As we -- as that market kind of gets acquired by yourselves and your -- and the larger majors, I know, Jim, you've talked a little bit about the potential for going a little further afield and possibly into hazardous. And is that still an option for you?  And would you go even further? I mean, we always worry a little bit about it getting beyond our core competency. So just curious, your view on what is an addressable market for Waste Management outside of solid or even outside of hazardous waste.\nJames Fish: No, I think we're kind of staying away from just strictly kind of a services-type business. And yes, there are some ancillary businesses that might be interesting to us. But at this point, there's -- as we've talked about, there's such a nice robust pipeline of just traditional solid waste that we feel like we can focus there. And then add to that a little bit of the recycling-type businesses that I mentioned earlier, and that should take up all of our time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Manthey of Baird.\nJames Fish: We lost Dave. He fell off the screen.\nOperator: Looks like our next question is going to come from Michael Feniger.\nJames Fish: We've done a good job in answering the questions. Did he miss the call? He just disappeared from the queue.\nOperator: So our next question comes from Kevin Chiang.\nKevin Chiang: Can you hear me?\nOperator: Yes.\nKevin Chiang: Third time's the charm here, I guess. Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe just a couple of quick ones for me. It sounds like you're feeling -- you're kind of moving past peak inflation here, but I guess who knows how long it will take to get back to normal inflation. And obviously, you've been pricing to offset inflation dollars. But I'm wondering, has there been a push to capture more of that inflation via core price versus using a surcharge program? I presume, and correct me if I'm wrong, that if you can kind of capture more of that inflation through the core price, it just ends up kind of being stickier as inflation starts to roll over and CPI starts to come down here.\nJames Fish: I think it's -- I think I heard you right. But it's a little bit of a combination of the 2. I mean, there's some surcharges there. We don't really -- we don't capture fuel in our core price or our yield numbers. It truly is designed to just be a pass-through for us. We do have an environmental fee, and that environmental fee does get captured in our price figures. But if that was your question, it's a combination of core price increases. And then also, there's a second component to that, which is holding on to those price increases, and that's why there's always a little bit of give and take in pricing. And that's been the model as long as I've been with the company, as long as we've been in existence, I think. So holding on to a higher percentage of those price increases is an important component.\nKevin Chiang: No, that's helpful. No, that's exactly what I was looking for. And then just last one for me. You're talking about some of these -- the repricing of index contracts. You talked about this 12-month lag. Some of the other industries I cover, just given how acute inflation has been, there's been a push to shrink, I guess, that time line between when they start seeing that acute pressure to when they can start repricing for it or start getting compensated for it. Has there been any push on your end to maybe shrink that lag? Has there been any desire from your customers' perspective to shrink that lag like we've seen in maybe some other industries?\nJohn Morris: Yes. I think residential is probably a great example of that. If you look at what our core price and yield results have tracked at the last 6, 8, maybe even 10 quarters, it certainly outpaced up in the last couple of quarters what CPI has been. That's not the case the last handful of quarters, which kind of shows you, Kevin, what we're doing on the pricing side to strike the right balance between what we're seeing in our contracted rate escalators, what we're willing to accept going forward.  So I think the most encouraging thing is when you look at that residential line of business, that's probably the best example of that index, we've outpaced what CPI has been. And as I said, the exception is the last couple of quarters. And we've also -- in terms of -- we don't want to necessarily shed the volume, but we want to be profitable. And when you look at the volume trade-offs we did and what's happening on the price side, you're seeing that strategy play out again in this quarter as well.\nJames Fish: And just one last point. That 12-month lag that you talked about is really contractual with these big municipalities. So there's not really an option for us to change that, unless they choose to change their bid specs.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Feniger of Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: Apologies about that. My main question, I know we're up on the hour, Jim, is your margin is going to finish this year at 28.1%. 5 years ago, it was at 28.3%. So it's basically been kind of range-bound. Yet now, you have a very profitable sustainability business with renewables. Your pricing is very strong in Q2. Does it feel like 2023 is when this margin range really breaks out 50 basis points or higher? Just based on where this business is today compared to even where it was 5 years ago?\nJames Fish: Yes. I mean, I think there's been a couple of things that have happened as we've kind of shot for this aspirational number of 30% or whatever it is. Obviously, ADS had an impact on margin. That business was more like a kind of a 24% margin business when we were 28% so digesting that has had an impact on margin. But look, it's been a great acquisition for us.  And then all of a sudden, we kind of finished digesting ADS, and then we get this big headwind from fuel. And Devina did a nice job of talking about the fact that it's really -- it's margin-destructive, but it's not earnings-destructive. It's designed to be neutral from an EBITDA standpoint, but it does hurt us on the margin line.  So to the extent that you see a couple of things going on, one is you see us continuing to raise the ADS business up to our level of kind of margin. That will help us. As you see fuel come back down, nothing that we're really doing there to affect margin, but it does have a positive impact on us.  And then the other thing that we've talked a lot about is 2 other things. One is we talked about pricing right now basically covering cost and starting to -- as you see inflation coming down, a bigger component of price goes to margin accretion. So that's number one. And then number 2 is this whole cost piece. As we take -- permanently take cost out of the organization and become less labor dependent, that definitely has an impact on margins. So all of that gives me reason for optimism that as we think about '23 and beyond, I think we will really see margin improvement in the overall business.\nDevina Rankin: Jim, I think that color was fantastic. The one thing I would emphasize, Michael, in terms of looking at the total company margin over that 5-year period, in addition to what Jim outlined specifically for commodity-based impacts and the ADS acquisition, is that when you think about the investment we're making in technology, it's showing up in our SG&A in a different way than it would have had we effectively decided to have SG&A dollars be to run the business model.  And so what you see from us is that we have a different level of SG&A than we otherwise would have if we weren't making these strategic investments that will provide significant returns over the long term. And so I really do think that you have to consider that aspect of how we have strategically changed over the last 5 years in terms of thinking about how our margins have adapted in that period.\nMichael Feniger: That was helpful to give us context of how to think about it over that 5-year stretch. And just lastly, Jim, I mean, what do you think is the right level of CPI for the business? What is the sweet spot? Because obviously, CPI of 1% for like that decade clearly doesn't feel like that's a great place for the industry and for your operations. Now CPI at 9%, that's another story.  Is there a sweet spot that you feel like is the right number where it helps you get good pricing resets on those contracts, yet you guys can also handle the cost inflation on the business in terms of also getting productivity savings every year? What would be that CPI sweet spot for the business, you think?\nJames Fish: I mean, it's a good question. I'm not sure I know what the right number is. I can tell you the wrong number is 9.1%. So I don't know where -- we have talked about the fact that as we see inflation drop off and I compare it to banks, I mean, as you know, the banks probably try and do that math as well. Where is the sweet spot for me in terms of rates? And I don't know where the sweet spot is on CPI. It might be 2% or 3%, if I had to kind of pick a number. But I don't know for sure and we haven't really done the math.  But there was no reason to do the math until 1.5 years ago because it's been the same -- it's kind of been sub-2% for most of my career. But now there is a reason to try and answer that question, and we'll do a bit of work on it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: A macro question. So you're not seeing a slowdown within the -- at this point despite maybe some increased caution on the macro environment in general. But are there any particular industries within commercial, for example, that are just being a little bit more cautious? That the conversations have changed a little bit?\nJames Fish: Well, you're right, Toni. I mean, there's a ton of speculation out there about what this -- when does the recession hit, how deep is the recession, how long is it?  I mean, the good news for us is that we are pretty -- I mentioned 75% of our business is pretty resilient to a downturn, so we perform well in any environment. We've talked a lot about special waste the last couple of quarters. And we're -- most of our revenue is kind of more of a lagging indicator. But special waste is the one leading indicator. And we have maybe a couple of leading indicators. One might be our construction and demolition, but that's -- as John said, it's a small part of our business.  Special waste is leading because it's largely industrial-type jobs, and those industrial companies have some discussion as to when they spend a lot of those dollars. And we're not seeing them turn that off. So our special waste was very strong for Q1. It was very strong for Q2, and we continue to be optimistic about special waste. Even when we look at our numbers in the month of July, we still are seeing very positive comparisons in special waste.  So as I think about the macro economy overall, I do think there is a recession coming. I'm not going to kind of buck the trend there because everybody is saying there's one coming. But I just feel like we're in a great industry to weather the storm and, ultimately, with some of the things we're doing with technology and reducing our labor dependency, come out of this thing better than anybody else.\nToni Kaplan: Sounds good. And then just as a follow-up, strong results, pricing, and the outlook, obviously raised there. Just wondering if you could talk maybe one on just commercial and industrial pricing this quarter sounded great. Just how are you thinking about pricing, commercial, industrial landfill on -- as the year goes on?\nJames Fish: Well, specific to landfill pricing. I mean, landfill pricing has been a focused area for probably 3 or 4 years for us. It was very good in Q2 and Q1. So we're pleased with the fact that we're able to put landfill pricing through.  And you're asking kind of more specifically around commercial and industrial pricing. Commercial and industrial pricing has been excellent as well. I would tell you that pricing, really across the board, I can't find a weak spot in terms of how we're performing on the price front. Whether it's residential or commercial, industrial landfill, everybody seems to be able to put price through.  I think part of that is that the customer is watching -- they're watching these business shows on TV as well, and they know inflation is out there. They know it's real. And because it's a small -- because our business is a small percentage of their overall spend, they're willing to take the price increase.\nOperator: Thank you. I'm showing no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish, President and CEO, for closing remarks.\nJames Fish: Great. So thanks for joining us today. Just quickly to conclude. At a time when there's so many questions about the outlook from a macro standpoint, we are -- we're really proud to be somewhat of a symbol of stability and strength to our investors.  We stressed today that the short-term outlook looks good for WM, but I think maybe more importantly, we're very excited about and confident in the long-term outlook. The long-term strategy is playing out just as we have expected, just as we communicated way back in 2019 at our Investor Day. And we expect that to play out through, not only the end of '22, but '23, '24 and beyond. So thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning, and we will talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. The strong operating and financial results of the second quarter confirmed a number of important indicators we saw emerge in Q1, positioning us to increase our full year financial outlook. I'll cover our updated guidance in a moment, but I want to give a little more color around our second quarter and year-to-date financials first.  As John discussed, our results have been driven by robust organic growth, led by our disciplined pricing focus as well as diligent cost management. Proactive management of our SG&A has been an important element of those cost management efforts. In the second quarter, adjusted SG&A was 9.4% of revenue, a 20 basis point improvement over the same period in 2021. We accomplished this result in spite of an increase in incentive compensation due to our focus on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the customer sales and back office functions. We are on track to deliver SG&A as a percentage of revenue of about 9.6% for the full year.  Operating EBITDA increased more than $100 million in the second quarter, driven by an increase in the operating EBITDA of our collection and disposal business of $107 million. Operating EBITDA margin in the quarter was 28.1%, a 50 basis point improvement from the first quarter of 2022. We are confident in our ability to achieve our full year margin outlook, which is a particularly strong result given the dilutive impacts from rising fuel costs, which we now estimate could be about 60 basis points for the year.  Year-to-date cash flow from operations was up $142 million or about 6.5% from the prior year, which has been driven by operating EBITDA growth of over 9%. Cash flow from operations growth was slightly muted relative to operating EBITDA growth due to higher cash taxes, which will continue throughout the year, and working capital pressure that we expect to moderate over the remainder of the year.  During the first half of the year, we've invested $856 million in capital to support the business, and we invested an additional $112 million to support the strategic growth of our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Our year-to-date free cash flow, which includes the impact of capital outlays to support our sustainability growth investments, is $1.35 billion, putting us on pace to exceed the upper end of our initial 2022 guidance of $2.05 billion to $2.15 billion.  While the pace of capital spending has been slower than expected in the first half of 2022, we currently expect truck deliveries, landfill construction and sustainability capital projects to ramp in the second half of the year. We're encouraged to see supply chain constraints in certain asset categories begin to show promising signs of improvement, though we are proactively managing the business in anticipation of the longer delivery schedules we've experienced over the last year. We will revisit capital and free cash flow guidance in more detail next quarter.  As Jim discussed, we are well positioned to allocate free cash flow among all our capital allocation priorities. In addition to increased acquisition expectations for the year, we now expect to allocate our full $1.5 billion authorization to share repurchases.  Turning now to our updated 2022 guidance. We expect revenue growth of approximately 10% and adjusted operating EBITDA in the range of $5.5 billion to $5.6 billion. The $175 million increase in operating EBITDA guidance is driven by more than $325 million from increased price and volume performance and $40 million from better performance in the renewable energy business. Those things are partially offset by approximately $190 million of higher costs, which were driven by a combination of inflation pressure and incentive compensation.  Note that this outlook assumes fuel prices remain at June levels for the second half of the year, equating to a 60 basis point drag to full year operating EBITDA margin. Even still, we expect to deliver margin of 28.1% at the midpoint of our guidance.  We remain optimistic that the alternative fuel tax credits will be approved in 2022 and continue to include the approximately $55 million benefit we would expect to receive in our outlook.  In closing, our excellent first half performance sets us up to deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2022. I can't thank the WM team enough for all their contributions to our success.  With that, Valerie, you let's open the line for questions. That's right. And that's looking at the operating expense line, so we would also -- for the EBITDA margin, and I think it's important in thinking about EBITDA margin in 2 pieces. So one is how did we perform relative to the expectations that we laid out at the beginning of the year. And what we can say there is that we're extremely pleased. And really, our outperformance relative to expectations is in 2 places, and that's our traditional solid waste business that outperformed expectations by about 40 basis points and the renewable energy business that outperformed expectations by 20 basis points.  As we've mentioned, we've had a couple of headwinds relative to our initial expectations, and those headwinds are fuel and the alternative fuel tax credits as well as incentive compensation. But when we put all of that together and think about our outlook for the full year and our performance in the first half, particularly relative to our original guidance, we can say that we're 60 basis points ahead of expectations on base performance, and that's a really strong outlook.  When we look at Q2 specifically, the walk forward between the 29.3% that we achieved in Q2 of '21, which I'll remind everyone, is the best quarterly performance that we've had in our history from a margin perspective, to what we delivered at 28.1% today for Q2, really, fuel is the story there in terms of that walk forward.  So what you saw in that 120 basis points is 80 basis points led by fuel. And that 80 basis points is 50 basis points from higher fuel costs, 30 basis points from the alternative fuel tax credits. Recycling was 40 basis points negative, that was in line with expectations. 30 basis points of that is from the brokerage business that we talk about, where it's effectively pass-through revenue. So higher commodity prices just translates into pretty much a dollar-for-dollar increase in cost. And then the other piece of that was higher incentive compensation cost at 30 basis points.  So really happy with the strong performance of the solid waste business, and I think that's the highlight when you look at the margins for the business in the quarter. So I'll take that in 2 pieces, Michael. On the recycling side of the business, we were better in the first half about $28 million. We expect actually to give some of that up in the second half of the year. So we expect about $20 million to $25 million of earnings pressure in the second half just because of where commodity prices were in the second half of '21 relative to what we expect them to be in the second half of '22.  On the renewable energy side, we have captured $27 million in the first half of '21 -- or '22, and we expect another $10 million to $20 million of incremental earnings in the back half. So when you net those 2, we expect to be down in the, call it, $10 million to $15 million range. That's right. But what I would say is the plus 100 to plus 140 now looks more like, call it, plus 80 to plus 120. And when you consider the impact of fuel at 60 basis points, that really does speak to the strength of the underlying fundamentals of solid waste and the incremental benefit of the renewable energy business relative to our initial expectations. Yes, that's right. From an earnings perspective, you'll really -- should be a zero-sum game for us. What we see on the fuel surcharge side of revenue growth, what we had in Q1 -- or Q2, I'm sorry, was $129 million. We expect similar levels, maybe a moderate decrease in the second half of the year on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But that effectively is a dollar-for-dollar offset as higher operating costs, both for direct fuel and our indirect costs from subcontractor costs and other transfer elements of the business. It was effectively equal. So it was a combination of direct fuel and indirect. So the indirect will show up in lines like the subcontractor category. So you can think of it effectively like a dollar-for-dollar offset. Yes, great question, Sean. First and foremost, I would say it's important to hear the message that we are very confident with the rollout of our sustainability initiatives, and those investments are on track. We talked about both the renewable energy facility and the recycling facility coming online and expectations for the remainder of the year there. It continue to be strong relative to our initial expectations. So when we look at capital being below our guided levels, it really is more in the traditional solid waste space and specifically for trucks.  As Jim just mentioned, our truck deliveries in 2022 has really been slow relative to our initial expectations. And even after we saw Q1 unfold, we revised those expectations, and they're still below what we had expected at that point in time. So as we look at how we spend our capital, we're adapting for that slowdown on the truck front. And we're looking at places across the rest of our business to proactively pull forward capital, whether it be in the landfill line of business where we've seen strong volumes, particularly in special waste, or as we look at other parts of the business that are performing well and have continued investment opportunities because those returns have been strong.  So overall, what I would tell you is we still need Q3 to unfold before we can give you the additional detail on the traditional capital part. I would tell you, at this point, we completely expect to stand firm on the sustainability capital at about $550 million for the year. Jim, I think that color was fantastic. The one thing I would emphasize, Michael, in terms of looking at the total company margin over that 5-year period, in addition to what Jim outlined specifically for commodity-based impacts and the ADS acquisition, is that when you think about the investment we're making in technology, it's showing up in our SG&A in a different way than it would have had we effectively decided to have SG&A dollars be to run the business model.  And so what you see from us is that we have a different level of SG&A than we otherwise would have if we weren't making these strategic investments that will provide significant returns over the long term. And so I really do think that you have to consider that aspect of how we have strategically changed over the last 5 years in terms of thinking about how our margins have adapted in that period."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Once again, we achieved exceptional organic revenue growth in the second quarter, led by collection and disposal yield of 6.2%. Our pricing accelerated sequentially as we continue to address persistent inflationary cost pressures throughout the business.  Second quarter core price increased 20 basis points from the first quarter to a record 7.5%. Core price was strong across every line of business, and we had standout performance of 10.6% in our industrial business and 9.4% in our commercial business. Customer receptivity to our pricing remains strong as second quarter churn, adjusted for the intentional loss of an unprofitable national account contract, was 9%. We remain confident that our pricing strategies are appropriately responsive to rising costs while prioritizing customer lifetime value. Our teams continue to be focused on disciplined pricing in the second half of the year, and we now expect 2022 core price of more than 7% and collection and disposal yield approaching 6%.  Key indicators in our business continue to signal healthy economic activity in the quarter. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew 2.3% with commercial volumes growing 1.6% and special waste volumes up more than 19%. Additionally, new business exceeded lost business as service increases continue to outpace service decreases by a wide margin. Second half volumes are expected to remain strong and for the full year, we expect collection and disposal volume growth of about 2.5%. Our teams remain focused on controlling operating cost. Adjusted operating expenses were 62.4% of revenue in the second quarter, a 130 basis point increase from the second quarter of 2021. The year-over-year increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was largely driven by fuel and commodity price impacts, 70 basis points from higher fuel costs, 30 basis points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022 and 30 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business.  In the second quarter, we again saw high single-digit inflation in our costs, and we are managing through this with both pricing and cost controls. Our core price is recovering our cost of inflation in each line of business, except residential, where the impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced. In that line of business, our conversion of approximately 2,000 railroad routes to automated side loaders will both reduce labor and significantly improve efficiency. This is one of the ways where we are investing in technology to reduce our dependency on certain high-turnover positions.  Additionally, early results from our pilot programs to fully optimize our roll-off routes are showing efficiency gains in the range of high single to low double-digit percentage increases. As we move into the second half of the year, we expect inflationary cost pressures to ease on a year-over-year basis given the proactive steps we took to raise frontline wages in the second half of 2021.  As Jim mentioned, we're excited about growth opportunities in our recycling and renewable energy businesses, and both businesses continue to deliver strong results. Together, recycling and renewable energy contributed $19 million of operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter. The recycling business is on track to deliver results on par or modestly higher than the record earnings we achieved in 2021. Our blended average recycling stream commodity price was $131 per ton in the second quarter, and we continue to expect a full year average of $125 per ton.  In the renewable energy business, better pricing for renewable natural gas, electricity and environmental credits is driving our full year outlook for this business higher than our original guidance by $35 million to $45 million. Overall, our second quarter results exceeded our expectations as we demonstrated our ability to execute on our disciplined pricing programs and manage costs.  I'm extremely proud of having the entire WM team work together to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Yes, we're not really exposed too much there, Tyler. The temp C&D business is low single digits. I was just going to say, Michael, I think the one caveat to that is what we're specifically doing in residential. And you can see that we continue to make progress on the core price side and the yield side, and we're still being pretty deliberate about what volume we're going to keep and what volume we're not going to keep. That would be the one caveat to what Jim commented on. We consider our business to be very price-inelastic. And the reason is that it's such a small percentage of the customer's overall cost structure. I mean, we've estimated it differs a little bit whether you're a residential customer versus a business customer, but it's probably 0.5% of a small business' overall spend. And then when you add to that what we're doing to truly differentiate ourselves, those 2 things cause pricing to be pretty darn sticky for us. So you're right. It is -- we tend to hold on to more of it than maybe other businesses might. Yes. No, that's right. I mean, the unit price stays where it is. And then it's just about the percentage, which is yield or core price. Those are percentage growth figures. And we think that the percentage growth figure, as I've said, does kind of taper down as inflation comes down, but the spread improves a bit. So we have a little bit more that goes towards margin improvement at 3% CPI than we do at 9.1% CPI. Yes, Sean, I think the commentary on labor, we got out front of it last year. And we see, while it's not going all the way down, it's going to moderate in the back half of the year because of the intentional steps we took last year. Devina touched on it, but we're still seeing inflationary pressure on third party on maintenance and repair. Subcontractors is one that sticks out.  And clearly, whether it's by rail or by truck, we're seeing the fuel impact there as well. That's a big chunk of the indirect pressure we're seeing. And I think the commodity piece runs through that a little bit as well. When you think about third-party maintenance and repairs, there's a commodity element to that.  So I would tell you that I feel like it's peaked, generally speaking. And I think the benefit we'll see is in terms of what we did with our labor, which is a big chunk of our operating expense line. The only thing I would add to what Jim has already said is we're taking kind of a total cost of operation view. Residential is a good view of that between capital and OpEx. And I would tell you, the other thing that's happening is when we started down this past few years ago, recycling and residential are 2 good examples. Kind of the calculus we were doing then, in this labor inflationary environment, those are actually -- those investments are getting better as we go along. As Jim mentioned, I don't think any of us think this labor shortage or the labor wage pressure is going to abate anytime soon. So as we continue to invest, these pro formas actually look better as time goes on. Yes. I think residential is probably a great example of that. If you look at what our core price and yield results have tracked at the last 6, 8, maybe even 10 quarters, it certainly outpaced up in the last couple of quarters what CPI has been. That's not the case the last handful of quarters, which kind of shows you, Kevin, what we're doing on the pricing side to strike the right balance between what we're seeing in our contracted rate escalators, what we're willing to accept going forward.  So I think the most encouraging thing is when you look at that residential line of business, that's probably the best example of that index, we've outpaced what CPI has been. And as I said, the exception is the last couple of quarters. And we've also -- in terms of -- we don't want to necessarily shed the volume, but we want to be profitable. And when you look at the volume trade-offs we did and what's happening on the price side, you're seeing that strategy play out again in this quarter as well."

            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The strength and resiliency of our business was clearly on display in the second quarter as we built on our first quarter momentum to deliver results that exceeded our expectations. Our teams remain focused on recovering inflationary cost pressures with our strongest-ever core price yield results. Our pricing results, combined with volume growth and sustainability contributions, drove quarterly revenue above $5 billion for the first time. Our robust revenue growth translated into operating -- into adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7.8%, which is above the upper end of our long-term growth profile of 5% to 7%.  Cash from operations remained strong in the second quarter, positioning us to return more than $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders to bring the year-to-date total of shareholder returns to more than $1 billion. You'll hear more details from Devina, but our strong start to the year gives us confidence to increase our 2022 outlook for revenue, adjusted operating EBITDA and free cash flow. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong volumes, an encouraging sign for economic activity across the areas we serve.  Currently, our key business indicators point to continued positive economic activity. That said, WM is well positioned in any economic environment. Our resilient business model is underpinned by our diverse customer base and essential nature -- the essential nature of our service and the annuity-like characteristics of about 75% of our revenue.  We continue to advance our long-term strategic priorities of providing the best workplace for our employees, investing in technology and automation that differentiates WM and permanently reduces our cost to serve and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Investing in making WM a great place to build a career while also reducing our labor dependency through attrition and automation together position us to navigate this tight labor market.  In our sustainability growth journey, we achieved 2 exciting milestones in the second quarter. We opened our fifth WM owned and operated RNG plant in Oklahoma, the first of the 17 new RNG facilities we announced, that are expected to add 21 million MMBtu of RNG to our renewable energy portfolio by 2026. We expect to complete construction on the next RNG facility by the end of the year.  On the recycling front, we brought online our Houston MRF, the sixth redesigned recycling facility utilizing advanced technology to reduce labor and improve product quality. Our advanced technology MRFs are yielding tangible benefits, resulting in about a 30% labor cost savings per ton compared to the rest of the single-stream network.  In the second half of the year, we expect to open 2 additional advanced technology recycling facilities and enter a new recycling market, keeping us on track to meet our recycling investment goals.  I want to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities, particularly related to M&A. Our strong operating EBITDA growth has allowed us to absorb the $4.6 billion acquisition of Advanced Disposal and quickly return our balance sheet to pre-ADS leverage levels. We consider a typical M&A year to be between $100 million and $200 million of acquisitions. This year, we have the strongest pipeline we've had in a long time and expect to close between $300 million and $400 million of acquisitions.  We will remain disciplined in our approach to traditional solid waste tuck-in and recycling acquisitions to maintain our strong financial position and generate industry-leading returns. Our cash generation plus our strong balance sheet affords us the ability to allocate capital to our priorities, investing in organic growth and sustainability initiatives, predictably growing our dividends, completing accretive acquisitions and returning cash through share repurchases.  In conclusion, I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I'm excited about the remainder of 2022 as we continue to deliver on our commitments to our team members, customers, communities and shareholders.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. That's why she's the CFO, Tyler. Yes, I think that's right, Tyler. I mean, listen, we got out from the labor issue kind of Q2, Q3 last year. So we feel like while we're still seeing labor inflation, it's not going to be at the same rate. And there's other obviously inflationary pressures, but I think you got it right. So I thought you were going to go down to the solid waste pricing path. But on RNG, look, I think our expectation here is that -- we built in $2.80, Jerry, for the back half of the year. We think that's pretty comfortable. As you know, based on our discussions, and we're with you that the business was pro forma-ed at much lower numbers. And even at those lower numbers, $2 for RIN and $2.50 in natural gas, even at those lower numbers, this is an outstanding business in terms of the returns. But specifically for the back half of '22, our expectation is that we'll see $2.80 in RIN pricing, and we feel comfortable with that number. Yes, Jerry. I would tell you that we're obviously -- the RIN market is what it is, and that's a part of our portfolio. But we have started to become -- and I think last quarter or the quarter before, started to do some direct offtakes for renewable natural gas. And we're seeing good momentum in some of those contracted rates. Well, you're absolutely right, Jerry, about the tailwind on those businesses that are driven by an index-type increase. The 12-month lag that we've talked a lot about really starts to help us most significantly in the first quarter of next year.  So if we believe that CPI has gotten pretty close to the top here at 9.1%, then we would see pricing -- let's just assume for the sake of discussion that inflation starts to taper back down. I think you'd see pricing in those open market businesses follow that down but not exactly. I think we've kind of talked about it compared to banks, for example, where their spreads are better at lower rates. And I think that's what you would see with our pricing is that if inflation starts to really taper back down, that you'd see a bigger percentage of our price go to margin improvement, not just cost recovery. Right now, we're kind of in a street fight trying to cover costs at 9.1% CPI.  And then with respect to your initial question, yes. When we get to really the first half of 2023, and recall that what we said about those index-driven price increases is that -- about 70% of that takes place in the first half of every year and 30% takes place in the second half of the year. So we will see some tailwind in the second half of 2022 from CPI, but it's just not as pronounced because only 30% of the revenue is getting it.  When we get to the first half of 2023 is when we get the real tailwind in -- it's primarily residential because that's the line of business that is most tied to an index. I think you're spot on, Michael. I mean, look, we're not crazy about 9.1% inflation. And as I said, we're doing everything we can with price and doing a good job with it, but to cover our cost. If inflation comes back down to a more reasonable number, let's call it 3% over the next kind of 2 to 3 quarters, then I think we have a greater percentage of our price that actually goes to margin improvement and not just focused on cost recovery, which is kind of where we are today with the open market pricing. Right. And my point being is if all of this unwinds from an inflationary standpoint or there's a recession, you don't walk back unit prices. You hold on to the unit price, plus I've got the favorable trend of higher price versus underlying internal cost of inflation in '23. The power of that is pretty compelling. Thanks, Hamzah. So you really kind of talked about it, primarily volume, right? But there's a couple of different components to your question here. I'll tell you what gives us cause for optimism here. We knew that 99% of the focus on this call is going to be about forward-looking statements. So a couple of things. First of all, I mentioned that on the price side, we -- to Michael's question, we have a very price-inelastic customer base. That's a real positive in terms of the stickiness of price, and price is one of the big 3. If I think of the big 3 being price, volume and cost control, we feel really good about price.  If we think about volume a little bit, and so just maybe a little bit of inside baseball here. We just had our 16 area vice presidents on for their quarterly reviews, and almost to a person, they're feeling really optimistic about their own individual areas. And when we look at our July numbers in terms of volume, they look pretty good. I mean, they look basically exactly like we saw in June. You have to kind of consider that we had 1 less work day. Fourth of July this year was on Monday, last year was on Sunday. So there's a little bit of -- we have to consider that. And we also are, on the commercial side, considering things like we intentionally shed a big national account that affected us by almost 1 percentage point.  And -- but if we factor those onetime things out, volume still looks pretty good. And the most forward-looking component of our volume is special waste. It was up 19% for Q2. But as we look out towards what the pipeline is telling us in -- for the remainder of the year, it still looks really good. Our volume in the first 3 weeks of July looks good in that special waste stream. So that's 2 of the big 3 there.  And I would also tell you, Hamzah, to your question about why we're different from other industries. I don't know that we're different from other industries necessarily. But our company, we do believe that we're starting to take some share. It's a tough operating market, a really tough operating market for a lot of companies. John talked a bit about this labor shortage, and I don't think that's a short-term trend. That is a long-term trend. That's why we've talked about kind of the third of the big 3, which is cost control and taking advantage of the attrition in our business, the cost categories that we're looking at, not backfilling for have -- some of them have 50% turnover.  So why go through that hamster wheel every single day? Why not use technology to let some of those jobs have attrit away and actually use that to our benefit? And the -- most other companies out there in our space just don't have the technology or the wherewithal.  So some of this that ultimately makes us look better even in a recessionary environment is that we feel good about taking share in a tough operating climate. Yes. So I just talked about the fact that it is a bit of a tough operating environment out there for a lot of companies. And so what we don't want to do and we've said this on several of our previous calls, we don't want to bail somebody out of a problem. I mean, we're still going to be conservative when it comes to valuations.  But we think there's some really good companies out there that are not asking for ridiculous prices, purchase prices, and those are attractive to us. And we see enough of those to say that in the solid waste space and in the recycling space, we feel more like a $300 million to $400 million a year versus more of our traditional $100 million to $200 million is appropriate. I do think, Sean, that Devina touched on it in her remarks. But the supply chain itself, I mean, she mentioned that we're seeing a little bit of easing there, and that is true. But that's pretty important to us, particularly as you think about the delivery of trucks to us. I mean, last year, we didn't get the trucks that we ordered. And so far this year, we have not gotten to the number that we expected. We're hopeful that in the back half of the year, we start to see a pretty significant ramp-up there in the vehicles that we've ordered. That's a pretty important part of the inflation picture because, as John mentioned, maintenance cost is not insignificant as a cost line item. And that obviously is impacted as you're having to keep older trucks in the fleet. So I think that what you're talking about, your question is really around -- is it where we expect to be with respect to capital? Or is it about what we think the impact will be from an operating standpoint by not backfilling some of these roles? Just so we're clear. Okay. So let's talk about the capital piece first. And if I just think about kind of the big buckets around where -- I've talked about 5,000 to 7,000 positions that we wouldn't refill. The big bucket's, as John mentioned, shifting from a rear-load truck to an ASL truck. There's about -- if you think about a rear-load being maybe a $280,000, $300,000 truck and ASL is maybe $100,000 more, so there is some additional capital going to an ASL. But really, if you think about that, that pays itself off in almost in 1 year's time because you're taking a helper off the back, and you're picking up a pretty significant chunk of productivity there.  We've done this many times, moving from rear-load to ASL, and the pickup in efficiency is about 15%. And then you take a helper off the back, the all-in cost of -- a lot of those are actually temp laborers. So we're paying a temp firm, might be $75,000 to $100,000 all in for that person on the back of the trucks. So it pays itself back almost in a year's time. That's bucket one. So there is some additional CapEx for the truck, but the OpEx goes away pretty fast.  If we think about another bucket, we've talked a lot about recycling. And we've said kind of somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions there as we -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've seen 30% reduction in the labor cost at those first 5 that we've done. And we think it's anywhere between 30% and 50% reduction. So one of the plants that we rebuilt was in Salt Lake City. That one actually was closer to 50% reduction in labor.  So it's a range of how much labor comes out and the capital is already accounted for. We've already talked about the $800 million-ish over a period of 4 years, that's in that number. And then we also, in recycling, gets an improved quality of the material at the back end of the plant, and that doesn't show up in -- that shows up in top line revenue. Use Salt Lake as an example there. Previously, before we rebuilt the plant, they were having to sell all their mixed paper as a low-grade paper. Now they're able to separate it. And they have a pretty big component of the high-grade paper that obviously comes at a higher price. Yes. So to kind of complete the answer there -- and good color, John. Thank you. It is -- what do we expect this impact to be? I mean, look, put a number on -- put whatever number you want on those 5,000 to 7,000 positions that don't get refilled. The good news is that this is not your traditional, okay, we're going to rip 10% of the workforce. That's not at all what this is. This is a very strategic approach to reducing our labor dependency by taking advantage of these very high-turnover numbers in some of these jobs.  And so the cost of -- the exit cost is just very low. The capital cost is largely accounted for. And the operating improvements, whether it's SG&A or operating cost, if it's 5,000 jobs, let's put a number on that of $50,000 to $100,000 per, it's a big -- it's a material impact to OpEx and to SG&A. If it's at the higher end of that job range, 7,000, then it becomes even better. It's a little bit of both. I mean we kind of consider -- we consider recycling to be traditional solid waste, but it's a bit of both. We announced the continuous investments last quarter or a couple of quarters ago and which is taking low-value plastics that we weren't getting paid a lot for and some of those mixed papers that I mentioned that are low value as well, and combining them and making a roofing material.  And so there's a little bit of both in this. How do we take material that is, for example, coming into the landfill today that really doesn't add a lot of value, that maybe is light? I mean if I'm thinking about plastics, plastics are very light, but plastics are also very recyclable. And so it's -- we're already doing everything we can with things like PET and HDPE, going through a traditional single stream. Are there other things we can do with plastics that come into the landfill? Taking them out of the landfill, where it doesn't decompose for 700 years or something, and doing something that's both environmentally and economically favorable to the existing model.  And then you're right, the other piece is just very traditional solid waste acquisitions, tuck-ins, that -- where we may have kind of a hole in our network or we've got something that feels like it's -- it would be additive and makes a lot of sense for us at a reasonable valuation. I guess if we're talking geography, we're a North American company. So we really haven't looked outside of North America for a big -- for any type of solid waste acquisition. Obviously, that doesn't meet the definition of a tuck-in anyway because we don't have operations overseas. So yes, within North America, when we look at these acquisitions, we're always looking at where it makes the most sense strategically for us and where we can bring it -- by the way, Walter, it's part of what -- of why we're excited about the -- this reduction in labor dependency.  It enables us -- if we believe that our competition can't do the same thing, that they're not able to use technology to reduce their labor dependency, then it gives us the ability to bring more synergies to the table when we acquire a company. So I think we're -- everything would be on the table within North America. And then, of course, if it requires a filing of some type, then we'll have Justice look at it. But we always feel like we want to be conservative on valuations, and that's maybe the single most important piece is does it meet our strategic goals? And is it valued properly? Yes. Look, I mean, it's -- I don't think it's against the rules to say that trying to reduce our cost structure is something that's very important to us. And to the extent that somebody else can't do that, that's their problem, not ours. I mean -- but it does present an opportunity. It's why we're seeing a pretty robust pipeline here.  I think there's a lot of companies out there that say, look, I'm not going to -- I don't want to be an HR coordinator 24/7. And I don't want to make the investments in technology to try and do the same thing that WM is doing, so I'll turn around and sell to them at a reasonable valuation. And that's okay. No, I think we're kind of staying away from just strictly kind of a services-type business. And yes, there are some ancillary businesses that might be interesting to us. But at this point, there's -- as we've talked about, there's such a nice robust pipeline of just traditional solid waste that we feel like we can focus there. And then add to that a little bit of the recycling-type businesses that I mentioned earlier, and that should take up all of our time. We lost Dave. He fell off the screen. We've done a good job in answering the questions. Did he miss the call? He just disappeared from the queue. I think it's -- I think I heard you right. But it's a little bit of a combination of the 2. I mean, there's some surcharges there. We don't really -- we don't capture fuel in our core price or our yield numbers. It truly is designed to just be a pass-through for us. We do have an environmental fee, and that environmental fee does get captured in our price figures. But if that was your question, it's a combination of core price increases. And then also, there's a second component to that, which is holding on to those price increases, and that's why there's always a little bit of give and take in pricing. And that's been the model as long as I've been with the company, as long as we've been in existence, I think. So holding on to a higher percentage of those price increases is an important component. And just one last point. That 12-month lag that you talked about is really contractual with these big municipalities. So there's not really an option for us to change that, unless they choose to change their bid specs. Yes. I mean, I think there's been a couple of things that have happened as we've kind of shot for this aspirational number of 30% or whatever it is. Obviously, ADS had an impact on margin. That business was more like a kind of a 24% margin business when we were 28% so digesting that has had an impact on margin. But look, it's been a great acquisition for us.  And then all of a sudden, we kind of finished digesting ADS, and then we get this big headwind from fuel. And Devina did a nice job of talking about the fact that it's really -- it's margin-destructive, but it's not earnings-destructive. It's designed to be neutral from an EBITDA standpoint, but it does hurt us on the margin line.  So to the extent that you see a couple of things going on, one is you see us continuing to raise the ADS business up to our level of kind of margin. That will help us. As you see fuel come back down, nothing that we're really doing there to affect margin, but it does have a positive impact on us.  And then the other thing that we've talked a lot about is 2 other things. One is we talked about pricing right now basically covering cost and starting to -- as you see inflation coming down, a bigger component of price goes to margin accretion. So that's number one. And then number 2 is this whole cost piece. As we take -- permanently take cost out of the organization and become less labor dependent, that definitely has an impact on margins. So all of that gives me reason for optimism that as we think about '23 and beyond, I think we will really see margin improvement in the overall business. I mean, it's a good question. I'm not sure I know what the right number is. I can tell you the wrong number is 9.1%. So I don't know where -- we have talked about the fact that as we see inflation drop off and I compare it to banks, I mean, as you know, the banks probably try and do that math as well. Where is the sweet spot for me in terms of rates? And I don't know where the sweet spot is on CPI. It might be 2% or 3%, if I had to kind of pick a number. But I don't know for sure and we haven't really done the math.  But there was no reason to do the math until 1.5 years ago because it's been the same -- it's kind of been sub-2% for most of my career. But now there is a reason to try and answer that question, and we'll do a bit of work on it. Well, you're right, Toni. I mean, there's a ton of speculation out there about what this -- when does the recession hit, how deep is the recession, how long is it?  I mean, the good news for us is that we are pretty -- I mentioned 75% of our business is pretty resilient to a downturn, so we perform well in any environment. We've talked a lot about special waste the last couple of quarters. And we're -- most of our revenue is kind of more of a lagging indicator. But special waste is the one leading indicator. And we have maybe a couple of leading indicators. One might be our construction and demolition, but that's -- as John said, it's a small part of our business.  Special waste is leading because it's largely industrial-type jobs, and those industrial companies have some discussion as to when they spend a lot of those dollars. And we're not seeing them turn that off. So our special waste was very strong for Q1. It was very strong for Q2, and we continue to be optimistic about special waste. Even when we look at our numbers in the month of July, we still are seeing very positive comparisons in special waste.  So as I think about the macro economy overall, I do think there is a recession coming. I'm not going to kind of buck the trend there because everybody is saying there's one coming. But I just feel like we're in a great industry to weather the storm and, ultimately, with some of the things we're doing with technology and reducing our labor dependency, come out of this thing better than anybody else. Well, specific to landfill pricing. I mean, landfill pricing has been a focused area for probably 3 or 4 years for us. It was very good in Q2 and Q1. So we're pleased with the fact that we're able to put landfill pricing through.  And you're asking kind of more specifically around commercial and industrial pricing. Commercial and industrial pricing has been excellent as well. I would tell you that pricing, really across the board, I can't find a weak spot in terms of how we're performing on the price front. Whether it's residential or commercial, industrial landfill, everybody seems to be able to put price through.  I think part of that is that the customer is watching -- they're watching these business shows on TV as well, and they know inflation is out there. They know it's real. And because it's a small -- because our business is a small percentage of their overall spend, they're willing to take the price increase. Great. So thanks for joining us today. Just quickly to conclude. At a time when there's so many questions about the outlook from a macro standpoint, we are -- we're really proud to be somewhat of a symbol of stability and strength to our investors.  We stressed today that the short-term outlook looks good for WM, but I think maybe more importantly, we're very excited about and confident in the long-term outlook. The long-term strategy is playing out just as we have expected, just as we communicated way back in 2019 at our Investor Day. And we expect that to play out through, not only the end of '22, but '23, '24 and beyond. So thanks again to everyone for joining us this morning, and we will talk to you next quarter."

Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The first quarter of every year sets the tone for the rest of the year, and our strong first quarter results really set us up for success in 2022. We delivered exceptional core price and yield results, grew profitable volumes and managed our costs. The result was double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA and cash from operations. In fact, our cash from operations was the highest we've ever generated in a quarter, allowing us to return $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders. Our operating EBITDA margin of 27.6% was ahead of our plan, even in the face of record inflation and the delayed approval of the alternative fuel tax credits. So we executed extremely well in the first quarter and achieved better results than we anticipated, positioning 2022 to be another great year for WM. In addition to the strong start in the first quarter, we see signs that the economy is trending positively. Several of the key leading performance indicators within our business, such as special waste volumes, construction and demolition volumes and new business formation pointed to continued strong economic activity and business performance for the balance of the year. The positive economic activity, combined with WM's diverse customer base, the recession-resilient nature of our business and nearly 75% of our revenue that is annuity-like, gives us confidence to reaffirm the full year outlook we provided in February. As we progress through the year, we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities of providing the best workplace, advancing technology and automation that differentiates WM and reduces costs and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Turning to our sustainability and technology investments, we're excited about the future. We see the opportunity to further our sustainability leadership by expanding recycling capacity, automating recycling processing and increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network. We opened a new recycling facility in the first quarter and we're on track to bring online another fully retrofitted MRF in the second quarter, along with the next WM-built renewable natural gas plant. These projects are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions. Regarding technology, last quarter, you heard us discuss cost-saving opportunities for automation and optimization, which involves creating a competitive advantage for WM by differentiating the customer experience, while reducing our labor dependency on certain roles. Through our focus on digital technology, we anticipate reducing 5,000 to 7,000 positions over the next 4 years. In this tight and expensive job market, it makes complete sense to use technology to reduce our dependency on certain high turnover jobs. In addition to tackling this attrition, technology produces a significant amount of data that we view as a valuable asset. John has referred to our trucks as rolling data centers and we're using that data and analytics to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, we're piloting the full end-to-end optimization of our roll-off routes, which will be the first of its kind in the industry. Early efficiency results in our pilots are very encouraging and our plan is to have our roll-off routes fully optimized by mid-'23. Finally, while we use automation and data to our advantage, we will invest in training and upskilling of our existing employees to -- existing employees to ready them for higher-skilled future roles. To sum it up, we've set the bar high in our first quarter with our results, and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong performance throughout the remainder of 2022. I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I know that they continue to work to deliver on our commitment to our customers, our communities and our shareholders. And we very much appreciate that. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 began on a high note with first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business topping 9%. Our expectation was that the first quarter would be our strongest quarter of the year, both for pricing and volume growth, and our teams delivered revenue that exceeded our expectations. Core price of 7.3% is more than double the result for the same quarter in 2021, as we work to secure price increases that keep pace with the inflationary environment. Strong pricing results across all lines of business translated into collection and disposal yield of 5.5%, with standout performance of 7.9% for commercial and 5.1% for landfill MSW. We remain confident that our pricing strategies appropriately respond to the rising costs and prioritize our focus on maximizing customer lifetime value. In the first quarter, we delivered record high core price, while maintaining churn near historic lows by using a data-driven and customer-focused approach. Shifting to volumes, first quarter collection and disposal volume grew 3.8%. Landfill volumes continue to be strong, with MSW volumes increasing more than 5% and special waste volumes growing almost 30% in the quarter. And while we expect some moderation in special waste volumes from our first quarter levels, our project pipelines remain strong. Also contributing to our strong volume results was significant growth in our national account business. In the first quarter, our Strategic Business Solutions team won more than $20 million of new annualized revenue. These wins were driven by our ability to meet customer sustainability and operating needs through a differentiated use of customer-facing data analytics and service capabilities. Our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were 62.3% of revenue in the first quarter. While cost inflation in the first quarter persisted in the high single digits, our operating costs improved 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to encouraging trends in our largest cost category, labor. First quarter overtime costs and training hours came down compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as we've improved retention and been successful in onboarding new team members to transition from training hours to productive hours. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily comes from 3 areas: 50 basis points in our collection and disposal business related to inflationary pressures, including the proactive and intentional steps we took last year to increase wages for frontline team members; 40 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business; and 30 points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022. When we think about the balance of the year, we expect the inflationary cost pressures to ease in the second half of 2022 as we lap acute inflation that began in the second half of 2021. We do anticipate some pressure on maintenance costs in 2022 as a result of delays in our truck delivery schedule resulting from ongoing supply chain constraints. Turning to our residential collection business, we continue to execute on our long-term plan to improve this line of business through pricing and automation. The impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced in this part of the business, and we are focused on appropriately pricing our contracts and reducing our costs by transitioning more of our residential fleet to automated single-driver vehicles. Our first quarter revenue growth results reflect our success in moving residential pricing as our yield was 5%. In the recycling line of business, we delivered another strong quarter with operating EBITDA growing by $23 million. Our blended average commodity price in the first quarter was about $126 per ton, which is in line with our full year expectations. We continue to see strong demand for recycled materials, and we remain focused on educating customers to help unlock additional supply of recyclables and employing technology to maximize the value of the material recovery while reducing our cost of processing. And finally, our renewable energy business contributed an additional $13 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter. We have a new renewable natural gas plant coming online in the next few weeks in Oklahoma, the 17th R&D plant in our network and the fifth developed by WM. The next RNG project is on track to come into service by the end of the year, positioning us to deliver on our 2026 targets as we expand our leadership in the landfill gas energy business. In closing, I want to thank the entire team for the fantastic job they do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a great start to 2022 and look forward to building on our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our disciplined pricing programs robust volume growth and solid recycling performance fueled strong top line growth, and that translated into a nearly 11% increase in operating EBITDA in the first quarter. Our operating EBITDA growth completely flowed through to cash from operations, as lower interest payments more than offset a modest decline in working capital benefits related primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in 2022 for a strong 2021 performance. We're pleased with these strong results and are well positioned to comfortably deliver on our full year outlook. Turning to capital expenditures. First quarter capital spending to support our business totaled $371 million, and we invested an additional $47 million in our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Given our acceleration of sustainability growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, we spent a little less capital on these investments in the first quarter, but we remain on track to advance these projects in 2022 as planned. We expect that our investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects will ramp up as we move through the balance of the year. While we continue to see supply chain constraints slow delivery schedules in some asset categories, we're managing spending across our portfolio and expect capital expenditures to support the business to be within our full year guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, and sustainability growth investments to be approximately $550 million in 2022. As you heard from Jim and John, our teams are executing on the recycling and R&D growth projects we discussed last quarter, and we're confident in the strong returns these projects provide. Keep in mind that these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures and reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. Yet we view these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business.  Putting it all together, our business generated first quarter free cash flow of $845 million. Before sustainability growth investments, first quarter free cash flow was $892 million, which puts us well on our way to achieving our full year outlook of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. We are well positioned to allocate our cash to sustainability growth investments, traditional tuck-in acquisitions and growing shareholder returns. We used our free cash flow to pay $275 million in dividends in the quarter, and we allocated $250 million to share repurchases, while maintaining our leverage ratio well within our targeted range. Turning to SG&A. We remain focused on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions. First quarter SG&A was 10.1% of revenue, a 60 basis point improvement over 2021. We fully expect to achieve SG&A as a percentage of revenue of less than 10% for the full year, even as we continue to invest in technology to differentiate WM and lower our cost to serve. In closing, our strong results are a testament to the dedication of our 50,000 team members. We're proud of our performance in the first quarter and excited about what we can achieve together over the remainder of the year. With that, Lorrie, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan of Morgan Stanley.\nToni Kaplan: Just given the strength we saw in Q1, just hoping you could add any additional color on why not raise the guidance? I know you said it puts you in a really good place for reaching the full year guidance. But is it the supply chain issues or uncertainty just in the macro, just wanting to understand some of the drivers there?\nJames Fish: I think, Toni, the last year was actually a little unique for us. I think it was the first year we've ever raised guidance in the first quarter. And so we didn't want to set a trend necessarily. I think we felt like the quarter was fantastic, sets us up well for the year. But before we would change that outlook, we wanted to get another quarter or 2 under our belts.\nToni Kaplan: That's great. I wanted to also ask about on the labor side, just an update on what you're seeing in the labor market, maybe churn. And I just wanted to ask if there's sort of -- in terms of the projects that you're implementing any sort of impact on like delaying those projects because of the tight labor market?\nJohn Morris: No, Toni. We've seen some increases in overtime, which I've honestly moderated over the last couple of quarters. So that's good news. We've been successful in bringing down our turnover numbers. They're not where we want them to be, but they're about 300 basis points better than they were 2 quarters ago. So we're seeing good trends overall on the labor front.  We were, to some extent, paint a little bit of a premium to service some of that business a few quarters ago as the overtime was up, but the good news is that's moderating. Our overtime percentages are coming down, our retention rates are better. So we feel pretty good about where we are and our ability to service any of these volume opportunities that present themselves.\nDevina Rankin: And then, Toni, with regard to our process on labor to advance the projects that we've discussed in sustainability and recycling. One of the things that's unique about WM is that we started this journey with a really strong team that's been developing these projects over the last several years, and we're leveraging that team and building it where appropriate in order to accelerate the investment from here, and we're really satisfied with where that stands.\nToni Kaplan: That sounds great. Maybe just one last thing for me. Core pricing looked really good in the first quarter. When you think about sort of the ability to offset inflation, it seems like that should be able to do it. Can you go beyond offsetting inflation? And when do you see core pricing sort of normalizing?\nJames Fish: Yes. Look, I would tell you, for the quarter, we were pleased with the results from a price perspective, considering that we talked about a 4% yield and 5.5% core price. As you know, things do moderate a little bit as we get later in the year just because the comps change. So you shouldn't expect to see the same raw numbers in Q3, Q4 because of the difficult comparisons. But we certainly have, I think, shown that we're pretty effective at using price to cover the cost inflation. I think it's also important that we focus on the cost side of the business, and that's why we're starting to really talk a lot about technology. I mentioned this 5,000 to 7,000 jobs, that\u2019s in a low-cost way, meaning we use attrition to take them out, that will be a significant contributor as we go down the road. So we're not just relying solely on price to improve margins. Some of it has to come from the cost side of the equation, it's going to be a combination of things that I think get us on a significant margin improvement path.\nOperator: And our next question is from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs.\nJerry Revich: Yes, I'd love to continue the discussion on core price. If you don't mind, really impressive performance. I'm wondering if you can talk about whether you folks went back to customers that had a price increase within the past year with the second price increase? Or is the acceleration that we're seeing an upside versus the original expectations driven by higher pricing on contracts that are rolling?\nJames Fish: Yes, Jerry, I'm not going to say that there isn't a single customer out of our $25 million that didn't get 2 price increases, but we've really, really tried to move away almost completely from that. And I hope that there aren't any, but -- what we're trying to do is when we take a price increase on customers, make it an annual thing. And so I can't say with 1,000% confidence that something didn't slip through the cracks. But I would tell you that that may have been a practice from years ago, but that practice has changed. So that pricing is more of an annual item for our customers.\nJerry Revich: That's super. So it sounds like the leading edge pricing is probably a couple of points even higher than the strong core price. And in terms of the landfill gas cadence, can you talk about as the RNG plants come online, is there a ramp-up period to get to full production and full efficiency? How quickly relative to the time lines that you outlined, Jim? Can we expect the full run rate earnings contribution?\nJames Fish: Yes, Jerry. I mean most of those plants have infrastructure in place already. So we're managing that gas. In most cases, the difference is we're switching over from the technology we were using to manage the gas to an RNG process. So once the plant is up and we've kind of knocked the kinks out, if you will, it comes up to speed fairly quickly. None of these are landfills where we're starting with no infrastructure, if that were the case, it would be different, but that's not our situation.\nDevina Rankin: And Jerry, just to put a fine point on how we're thinking about the build of financial value from these plants, our 2022 guidance did contemplate the two facilities that we're bringing online in 2022. And because of the timing of bringing them online, it really did have a pretty inconsequential impact, particularly the one that comes in the fourth quarter. But we do expect a step change in 2023, and we'll give you more clarity on that as we get closer to that point.\nJerry Revich: Super. And I'm wondering if you folks would be willing to tell us the timing of additional plants coming online in '23 with the type of precise schedule that you laid out for '22 at this point?\nDevina Rankin: At this point, it's too early for us to give you those details. We are actively pulling in the equipments and the permitting processes. And because of the uncertainty in those processes, we just can't predict at this point with the same level of certainty that we've given you for 2022, what we expect in the year ahead. But as we get closer to those dates, we certainly will.\nOperator: And our next question is from Hamzah Mazari of Jefferies.\nHamzah Mazari: Just in terms of pricing, do you have a sense of what percent of your customers actually push back on pricing? Because pricing in this sector from '09 to 2012 was very, very low, 1%, 1.5%. And maybe the sector found discipline, maybe 2015, and it's a small ticket cost item. So is it 5% that pushback or 10%, 20%? Just any sense of that would be helpful for investors.\nJohn Morris: Yes. So I can't speak to the sector. What I can tell you, though, is there's a couple of those metrics we pay close attention to. One is churn, which in my comments, I said, is still near historical lows. So we haven't seen really a lot of movement there even when you look at the pricing that we posted for the quarter. We look at service increases and decreases as also a measurement of the health and those continue to be positive in a big way. And then lastly, the metric we look at is rollbacks. And I will tell you that rollbacks are much stronger year-over-year. So even as we've addressed this -- and I think we all agree that customers understand that there is real inflationary pressure. And I think that's -- that, coupled with the value in terms of service we're delivering is the reason why you're seeing rollbacks even lower despite us having push through more on the revenue quality side.\nHamzah Mazari: Got it. And then just lastly, I'll turn it over, do you -- I guess, do you have a sense of as it relates to the sustainability investments? Does that create more volatility in your portfolio or less volatility? I know the recycling piece, you talked about sort of more of a cost takeout. But I guess on the landfill side, landfill to gas side, I guess have you made a decision on fixed price versus kind of levered to the end market? And just any thoughts as to volatility in the portfolio post some of the investments? Is there less or more?\nDevina Rankin: It's a great question, Hamzah, and one that we're focused on internally in terms of how we'll manage this over the long term as this becomes a larger part of our business. Volatility in the natural gas business will certainly increase relative to the traditional solid waste business. That volatility, though, only comes from the top line of the business. There really is no volatility in the middle of the income statement. And so for us, it's about how we evaluate every vantage point of the revenue life cycle and think about what we're exposed to in spot markets and what we can secure long-term contracts for. And we are currently addressing some long-term contracts. We've discussed the fact that some of those are extending beyond even 10 years at this point. We want to ensure that while we consider long-term contracts, we don't somehow diminish the return of the portfolio because we are making sizable investments here. We want to be sure that we're appropriately balancing ourselves between spot market and the long term to maximize the returns.\nOperator: And our next question is from Michael Hoffman of Stifel.\nMichael Hoffman: So to come back to the pricing, which was terrific, and you stood up and delivered on what you said you were going to do which was get in the market and do it aggressively to make up for '21. Just to remind us all, your once-a-year objective is on contract renewal cycles, not just once a year at a point of time. Is that correct?\nJames Fish: Yes, that's right.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes. Okay. So there's a rolling effect of price all year long, it's just you're not intending to come out of a customer more than once is the objective?\nJames Fish: Well, that's right. And I think the point about the price increase being once a year is that there may be some price that's still on the table out there because we didn't take price increases as aggressively in March of last year or in April of last year. So those will come around. I mean inflation didn't really kind of hit us hard until Q3. So you will see some pickup there that we didn't choose to take, even though that customer may have -- that the cost for that -- for servicing that customer have increased dramatically in Q3, Q4, the price wouldn't have mirrored that until we get to the anniversary this year.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. And then I fully agree and appreciate that not raising guidance now allows for the normal seasonality to occur and the like. But when I think about what you did give in guidance, 5.5% in core and 4% on price, 2% on volume, the 1Q numbers are, how much above your own expectation were they comparatively? The 7.5%, the 5.5%, the 3.6%, how much did you exceed your own expectations?\nDevina Rankin: So on the price side, I would tell you, our expectations had been when we set our guidance that we would see stronger price performance and volume performance in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, simply because of the year-over-year comp. We continue to see that math holds. And that, therefore, means that as we look at both the guidance we established and where we are today, that we expect Q1 to be the peak, I would say, in terms of the print on core price and on yields. That being said, if I look purely at the numbers, I would tell you, we were about 100 basis points, maybe a little higher than that, above our expectations on core price. On the volume side, they were stronger than expectations, particularly in special waste. The rest of the business really performed according to plan.\nJames Fish: Well, I think commercial was very strong too, on the volume, Scott. I don't know --\nDevina Rankin: It was. It was just generally, speaking in line with what we would have projected for the year, we're really optimistic that the commercial volume strength continues. But as John remarked earlier, the special waste volumes is one of the things that we have our eye on, because approaching 30% increase on a year-over-year basis, certainly isn't something that we had predicted.\nJames Fish: Michael, sometimes we talk a little bit about what the current month looks like. And we're not seeing anything that would change our view right now in April.\nMichael Hoffman: Fair enough. And just so everybody is looking at data, the $148 million of volume versus the -- which is like 3.5% versus the almost 8% landfill volume increase. The difference there is that there's a huge chunk of special waste in that almost 8% landfill volume year-over-year number.\nJames Fish: There was -- definitely special waste was a strong point. But the great thing about the quarter, if we're really focusing on just kind of this short-term quarter and then the remainder of the year is that we kind of had universal strength. And I'm not sure we've had a quarter like this where virtually everything looked good. I mean even C&D, you might look at C&D and say, \"Well, that was flat.\" But if you look at last year with all the fire and flood volume in it, if you pull that out, C&D was really strong on its own. So whether it's MSW volume or commercial volume or special waste or C&D, everything looks strong. We are keeping our eye on the macro economy because there's a lot of chatter out there about that. But we're not seeing any signals right now in those forward-looking waste streams that would indicate that there's a big downturn coming. And believe me, we're looking at it. Nothing shows up right now.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then the fuel -- the industry fuel surcharges, they're very good at it. We had a big spike in March. Can you help us get this right instead of guessing what should we be modeling for that dollar change for the second quarter based on what happened coming into 2Q? You did $90 million in surcharge in 1Q. It's got to be bigger, but what's the right place to be?\nDevina Rankin: Well, a quick clarification on the $90 million on the fuel surcharge line, it's important to note that, that also includes renewable energy pricing. So the fuel surcharge was about $70 million of the $90 million. That being said, March was about 45% of the quarter. And so the ramp that you mentioned was significant, and we continue to expect that will persist through the remainder of the year. Our prediction right now is $90 million to $100 million per quarter.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. All right. That's terrific. And then since you alluded to the cadence, Devina, on CapEx. Can you give us a little framing of how we should land that to get the free cash flow per quarter kind of close to right, since it's such a big number to flesh out?\nDevina Rankin: John did a great job of talking about the supply chain constraints. And so while we would love to give you some clarity on the cadence of capital for us right now, it's just more difficult for us to predict quarter by quarter, particularly for truck capital where we're seeing delivery schedules lengthen. I would tell you, Q2 is usually the point in time that we start to see ramp, particularly in the landfill line of business. And so you'll see that -- I do expect Q4 to be a pretty heavy capital quarter again, though, for us. So I think you can take our guidance for each of them and make it pretty ratable over Q2 through Q4.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then you shared with us last quarter your second half of the year, internal cost inflation kind of ran at 6% and 7%. What were we running in the first quarter?\nDevina Rankin: It was closer to 9%.\nMichael Hoffman: And is it coming down?\nDevina Rankin: No. We think that this is effectively the peak, and we expect it to plateau and then as we discussed, we expect to see some moderation in the back half because we'll lap the labor increases that we executed upon beginning in the third quarter of '21.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then last one on the renewable energy side, you have shared that your objective is to kind of create that stability on the profit line through the long-term contracts. The big change here is that we're moving away from a transportation buyer to a nontransportation buyer. And have you gotten more than indications of interest that they really are willing to pay a sustained premium. And I'm not talking current market rate, even just something higher than the long-term average of what the RIN has been to create that stability on the profit line?\nJohn Morris: Yes, Michael. We've executed a handful of contracts being commented. One was around a 10-year mark, one was a little longer than that. And the short answer to your question is yes. It's a small percentage of the gas we produce now. We're going to continue as Devina said, to look to stabilize the portfolio by putting a portion of those contracts in a fixed position. But the short answer is yes, people are willing to buy and yes, they're willing to pay a premium on an MMBtu basis.\nMichael Hoffman: And it's a non-transportation buyer, it's utilities, it's institutions, property maintenance, trends, things like -- right. Last question, Devina, you've shared in the past that the ramp in the contribution is modest in '23, a little more in '24 and then it really moves up in '25. That pattern has not changed, right, in light of one of the earlier questions?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, that's correct, Michael.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Great. Good luck for the rest of the year, nice start.\nOperator: And our next question is from Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: So if we go back to the volume, you mentioned special waste and even commercial coming in a little bit better than trend. We seem to be fairly through the recovery phase and yet you still are putting up some pretty good volume numbers. Historically, we've always looked at waste as kind of a few demographic aspects and urbanization and so on being offset by some diversion and net-net, looking at overall a flat volume cadence over the long term and really pricing being an opportunity. Is that changing now? Has it -- when you look at your volume trajectory here and the continued growth you're seeing in volume, is there anything structural that you think is going on right now that you think will have longer-term impact in terms of perhaps positive volume growth going forward?\nJames Fish: I think what structurally is changing versus maybe previous quarters is that we're starting to really separate ourselves, I believe, from the pack. So it's not just driven by micro and macroeconomics, it's driven by the fact that WM is -- we don't tend to -- we tend to on these calls talk a lot about kind of short term, the outlook and what the quarter looked like and what the remainder of the year is going to look like. But we also tried to inject in a bit of what we're doing strategically. And I would tell you, Walter, we're making huge strides in digitalizing our customer service. It's something the airlines did years ago, and now we're doing that. And it is separating us from a lot of others in the industry. We believe we're taking share. I believe that's part of what you're seeing in the volume picture. I can't break it out for you by line of business, but as we do that, and we believe that's kind of a 3, 5, even a 10-year strategy, similar to what we're talking about with sustainability, there's an awful lot of customers out there that are talking to us about data and analytics for their own sustainability initiatives. And we're really the only one that can provide that level that they're asking for. Nobody else can do that. So I would tell you this is not just about micro 101, this is about not only microeconomics, but it's also about the strategy we're putting in place that I believe is absolutely taking share and will take more share as we further differentiate ourselves down the road.\nWalter Spracklin: I think if that's true, you would probably see it in the special waste and commercial areas, which is where you are indeed seeing the strength. So that's a --\nJames Fish: That's absolutely right. I mean, look, the short story is, that's why I'm still bullish on this company. Obviously, I'm biased, but I got to tell you, I mean, I'm really bullish on it even at $160. I mean it's -- the strategy to me, whether you're talking about the brand that can't be matched, the labor -- the reduction of labor dependency, which doesn't address the volume aspect, but addresses the cost aspect and using the digitalization customer experience and to help us reduce our labor dependency by 5,000 to 7,000 jobs hasn't gotten a lot of comments from investors, but that's a big deal. And so all of that, I think, helps separate us from others who just simply can't replicate that.\nWalter Spracklin: Great points. Turning now to M&A. One of your competitors obviously has moved a little bit outside of pure solid waste into a little bit of hazardous and there's been some discussion or rumor out there that you may do the same without you commenting on that. Is that something conceptually that's in the cards for you? Or are solid waste kind of your singular focus for M&A opportunities?\nJames Fish: Yes. I mean, look, we've seen the rumors. And I would tell you this, we're -- just as I went through with you kind of our strategy, which is really an organic strategy, we're really pleased with the results of our organic strategy. And at the same time, we'll continue to look at some of the small tuck-ins we may do, something that's an adjacency. We've talked about those as well that are related to our sustainability strategy. And that's probably where we draw the line as far as M&A goes. I will tell you that, in my view, there are reasons today to be conservative when it comes to M&A. It goes back to what I said about us being differentiated. Some of these other haulers, by the way, some of them are talking to us that have pressures on driver and technician turnover, significant pressures on driver technician turnover that are absolutely seeing wage inflation there, they're having a difficult time getting capital equipment probably times 2 versus where we are. And they don't have a sustainability service offering that is now being requested. Those are reasons to not go out and pay a big, heavy multiple to acquire some of these folks.\nWalter Spracklin: Very good point. So I appreciate the color and congrats on a great quarter.\nOperator: And our next question is from Tyler Brown of Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Devina, I may have missed it. But I was hoping you could just give us a little more color on the 70 basis point decline in margins? Just thinking about some of the puts and takes there. I'm thinking about things like fuel, commodities, maybe the tax credits maybe that would have influenced it year-over-year because with 9% core inflation and, call it, a 5% to 6% yield, were core margins down?\nDevina Rankin: So it's really interesting when you look at the margin of the quarter, it certainly outperformed our expectation, and that started at the top line and continued through in terms of managing costs, which John mentioned earlier, particularly on the labor side. I think what's important is that you normalize for the fuel tax credit first because that really gets us focused on the rest of the business and how we've performed. And that was 30 basis points. And so when you look at Q1's performance, and you can see that we were only down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis, and that compares to our expectation that we'd be down about 100 basis in the first half. We're certainly very pleased with that performance. The overall puts and takes just to build the bridge is that I would tell you the positive drivers from a margin perspective in the quarter were 20 basis points from the renewable energy business, about 10 basis points for leverage on SG&A beyond expectations. Recycling, this is the brokerage business. It's led by the brokerage business. It includes all elements of the recycling line of business, but that was down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And then the collection and disposal business overall was down 30 basis points. But what's really important to highlight there is that sequentially improved 50 basis points when you remove the impact of the fuel tax credit. So we're really pleased with that performance, and it outpaced our expectations. We still remain cautious about margin in the first half of the year relative to prior year because as a reminder, Q2 of last year was, I believe, an all-time high at 29.3%. So we still expect margins in the first half to be on a year-over-year basis, a more difficult comp and therefore, a decrease, but we expect the margin momentum that we began in the first quarter to continue throughout the year.\nTyler Brown: Okay. So that leads me to my second question. So it's still going to be soft, it feels like in the first half. I don't want to put you too much on the spot, but do you think that margins can still improve for the full year despite the dilutive impact of the fuel? And I'm thinking that fuel is maybe an extra 50 basis points of dilution, but I don't know if that's in the right ZIP code?\nDevina Rankin: So I'm going to separate fuel tax credits and the impact of rising fuel costs. But fuel tax credit, I would tell you, we hope, is a timing difference. Our outlook right now is that, that 30 basis points may continue, and we would love to see resolution sooner rather than later, but we think it could go all the way through the fourth quarter, but we do expect that to be a timing issue only not contribute to the margin of the business overall. From a diesel fuel rising cost perspective, we certainly saw that impact in the first quarter. And like I said earlier, at ramp in March, we estimate that the impact of that for every dollar change in diesel fuel is about 20 basis points of margin pressure.\nJames Fish: To my previous point to Walter about margin, there seems to be a real focus on pricing, which is the right focus. But when you think about margin, there's a cost aspect too. And then so just to give you a couple of examples, we fully expect that with the digitalization of our customer experience, for example, that we have built into our plan that we won't rehire some customer experience positions, I talked to Mike Watson about this morning and -- so we've built that into our plan, probably as many as 300 positions that won't rehire when they trade away. So this isn't laying anybody off, this is just saying when we have 50% turnover in some of those positions and calls come through our call centers that are asking for ETA or asking for status of a payment or a bulky pickup, those have fully been automated. And so we've agreed that we won't replace those positions and that amounts to somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 positions for the year that we built into our plan. Similarly, with this move from rear load to ASL, we think there's as many as 2,000 of those that over the next 4 years, come out. And so you get a helper on the back of the truck that comes out, but you also get -- we know this from experience, a 30% pickup in efficiency when you move from rear load to ASL.  The Brent Bell is taking out positions as we automate these plants, somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 positions net and I say that because we'll be upskilling some positions there. So that includes both positions coming out and then positions being added back. And the net of that is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions over the next 4 years. And some of those do start hitting us in 2022 and then really accelerate in 2023. All of that, in addition to what we're doing on price, will have an impact on margins.\nTyler Brown: Right, right. Very idiosyncratic. I appreciate that fully. So the bigger question on pricing, so -- can you break it down on the 5.5% collection disposal yield between, call it, your open markets and your more restricted markets? Because it feels like a lot of the pricing momentum is being driven in the open market right now, but that CPI linked to that regulated return pricing should accelerate as '22 plays out? So I know you're talking about the high watermark in Q1 on core price, but why would it fade if the restricted piece is going to accelerate? Or is it just not enough mathematically to get it -- to keep the pricing where it is today?\nDevina Rankin: So Tyler, I think the easiest way to look at it, we don't have specific breakdowns between open market and restricted prices. But what we've talked about is with rate restricted pricing, we do reset about 70% of that in the first half. And so those resets being loaded toward the first half is one of the reasons that we expect the high watermark to exist in the first half relative to the second half, and then it comes back to those comps. What I would say is that our pricing on The Street continues to have momentum over the course of the year as our contracts come up, particularly on open market and some of the actions that we took and the impact of fuel that we discussed will certainly continue to drive price higher. That's not reflected in your collection and disposal yields. But I really do think that this comes down to being focused on our market-based pricing and knowing that, that momentum is not what's flowing, it's just the comparisons on a year-over-year basis and the fact that we started to take pricing action more reflective of the cost environment in the second half of last year.\nOperator: And our next question is from David Manthey of Baird.\nDavid Manthey : First question on labor and benefits, both OpEx and SG&A. I think you noted that the proactive 2021 wage increases from last year, but are there any other parts of that cost stack that are elevated or understated this quarter that we should watch for the remainder of the year, things like, I don't know, incentive comp or health care or anything like that?\nJohn Morris: I'll start the operating side, Devina can weigh in maybe the SG&A and benefit side. I would -- we spoke to labor, obviously, been a long pole in the tent continuing to see high single, low double-digit inflation on labor. I think it's most pronounced. We mentioned in the residential line of business, most labor-intense line of business that we have. I would tell you, maintenance, in my prepared comments, David, we think that if there are some supply chain disruptions that linger through the balance of the year, we may be in a position where we're going to keep some of our older fleet employed for a little bit longer until we catch up. We don't see that as a barrier to be able to take advantage of some of the volume and market share that Jim commented on, it may put a little pressure on OpEx versus CapEx. But as Devina said, it's early in the year, and we've got a little bit of time here before I think we need to pivot. That would be one spot in the P&L where you might see it on the operating side.\nDevina Rankin: And then on the incentive compensation and health and welfare specifically, what I would tell you is I do think that incentive compensation could modestly increase over the remainder of the year from the Q1 level, just as we get further into the year, we'll get finer on our estimates and outlook and therefore, the accruals. But with regard to health and welfare, we are seeing the trends of those costs return to pre-COVID levels, where medical activity is getting back to normal. And as a result, those costs are pretty well in line with what we would have expected. They do tend to moderate over the remainder of the year, but nothing unusual on a year-over-year basis.\nDavid Manthey : Okay. And second on recycling, could you update us on what percentage of recycling revenues are under some form of fee-for-service agreement? And historically, you've told us that about 2/3 of the material that you collect has 0 to negative value. And I'm wondering is that still directionally the case? And as you put in these state-of-the-art automated MRFs, does that percentage change materially?\nJohn Morris: So David, the MRFs that we're automating are certainly producing a better product and doing it more efficiently. And I think that model actually gets better with the labor increases we're seeing, right? We're employing less labor in these plants. The rates are going up. So the investments we were talking about 18 months, 24 months ago and upgrading these plants is actually printing better not just because the arbitrage has gotten better, the quality of the product coming out of these facilities is better when you use a mechanized process to pull that material out. It stands to reason that you would get a better, cleaner product coming out of there. I think on the pricing side, what we're seeing is very consistent and strong demand on the fiber side, mixed paper has been a good tailwind over the last couple of years, and we're seeing continued demand increase for some of the other streams, the plastic streams. So we feel good about the top line and the demand that's being created. And as I mentioned, that's something we're going to continue to do is to educate our customers and use technology to unlock some of those streams. I would tell you in terms of negative value, the one that probably stand, I mean there's a residual content that tracks in the high teens to about 20%. We've been working on getting that down over the last few years. We feel technology will continue to help us in that regard. It's really the residual piece and glass, right? There's not really any positive market for glass. There's an environmental benefit to arguably keeping it out of the stream, but there's not a market that's positive for glass at the moment.  Did I catch all your questions?\nDavid Manthey : That does it.\nOperator: And our next question is from Sean Eastman of KeyBanc Capital.\nSean Eastman: Just coming back to the margins. As a summary, do we need to be thinking about that 0 to 40 basis points of expansion for the full year differently in light of what we've seen in the first quarter and the movements on fuel? And are we still going to be down 100 bps in the first half, like you had communicated previously? If you're willing to sort of refresh those expectations, that would be super helpful.\nDevina Rankin: So Sean, I think fundamentally, what this comes back to is us not wanting to be in a position to revise guidance across the board after just one quarter. And so the overall trend that we expected where our first half comps are just going to be tougher from a margin perspective than the second half comps. And therefore, we will relatively underperform our full year outlook in the first half and see a build as we get into the third quarter in terms of margin performance still holds.  In terms of the magnitude of it, I think Tyler's question earlier about the impact of fuel, framing that as about a 20 to 40 basis point impact, given what we're seeing in diesel fuels, we're pretty satisfied that we're going to be able to absorb the negative impacts of that. And so when we look at full year outlook for margin, we do see some upside particularly because price has come in so strong and we've seen positive momentum on retention. It's just too early for us to update the specificity with regard to how we see that flowing through for the rest of the year.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Totally fair. Great answer. And coming back to the alternative fuel tax credit dynamic and those not being renewed yet. How is that built into the full year? And how big of a swing is that if -- or once those tax credits are renewed?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So it was $12 million for the quarter. The full year impact is expected to be a little north of $55 million. So the impact for the remainder of the year, we estimate to be about $45 million. We fully expect that we'll end the year with some clarity on this. But if we don't receive that clarity, it would be about a $55 million to $60 million negative impact relative to the guidance that we've provided.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Excellent. And then just real quick, relative to the $400 million EBITDA guidance for the RNG facilities by 2026. Can you tell us what that EBITDA number was in 2021 actual and what that number is in the 2022 guidance?\nDevina Rankin: I don't have the specifics on that. Ed and Heather will be able to get you more color. The only thing that we provide is the year-over-year increase in that was $13 million of a year-over-year benefit in the quarter. The color there I would give you is that we estimate that for every $0.10 change in RIN values, we see a $4 million to $5 million change in our EBITDA, and that continues to hold through 2022, we will see that increase as we get into '23 with additional production.\nJames Fish: I think it was about $180 million in 2021. But Ed and Heather can verify that, but I think it was about $180 million.\nOperator: And our next question is from Noah Kaye of Oppenheimer.\nNoah Kaye: You mentioned you picked up about $20 million in annualized national account revenues this quarter. I think you mentioned also the sustainability services were a big driver of that. So Jim, I just want to build on your comments earlier. Can you give us some examples for investors of what services the customer is actually asking for in values, what you're providing here that maybe smaller competitors aren't that's helping you to win this business?\nJames Fish: Well, when we talk specifically about national accounts, I mentioned that data and analytics are very important to them. They all have sustainability initiatives, every one of them. And so when we think about renewing some of these big national accounts that we renewed or signing new accounts, one of their primary asks is what kind of reporting tools do you have that can provide the information on a store-by-store basis, for example. So that's critically important, and that's been a real differentiator for us.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. That's helpful. And then I just want to understand a little bit the way you're proceeding with the automation initiative on the resi line transition to ASLs. Are you thinking about those investments as timed with contract renewals? Or is this really a substitution for fleets that are on existing contracts? In other words, this is sort of a mid-contract type initiative?\nJohn Morris: So I would tell you, Noah, where we have the opportunity to do a mid-contract we're going as fast as we can. We're not waiting, so to speak, for contracts to roll. I think a lot of municipalities we're having some really productive discussions with them because they've seen whether that we're a service provider or not, that's a strain on labor is showing up in the ability to service some of these municipalities, and we've seen opportunities to step in and convert these mid-contract. And certainly, to the extent that we are not able to do that, there is that period of time when these municipalities or franchises are going out for RFP and we're trying to make sure we're in front of that to have productive and educational conversations, if you will, about what the benefits are of automating these services.\nNoah Kaye: But just to clarify, I mean, for some of these routes, these municipalities, I mean the type of container may have to change as well. So there is some work involved, right, in educating and getting that change in place. But for you, just to clarify, the ROI is good enough such that you can put in the time and effort to have those changes take effect and convert the fleet over and you're just getting the savings on the labor and the efficiency?\nJohn Morris: Absolutely. I think for the municipality, you bring up a good point, when you go to kind of the pick up everything at the curb model to a containerized model, it helps in terms of the municipalities understanding, managing their costs and the quality material on the recycling side. And I think I won't go down this rapid trail, but all the technology we put on the trucks becomes that much more valuable when you automate the service, and we've got the ability to look at each of these transactions to help educate these customers.\nJames Fish: When you think about the returns, Noah, I mean, it's a pretty easy math equation. On the negative side of the ledger, you get a higher capital cost for an ASL versus a rear loader to the tune of about $60,000, maybe 20% of the cost of the vehicle. But on the positive side, obviously, you get a helper coming off the back, put whatever number you want on that. And that is perpetual, whereas the capital cost is a onetime cost for the life of the vehicle. And then you get a safety improvement. You get a 30% -- as I mentioned, a 30% pickup in productivity or efficiency because we're just -- we're picking up 30% more homes per hour with an ASL than over a reloader. So the math is really compelling. It makes sense for us to move as quickly as we can on John's point.\nOperator: And our next question is from Michael Feniger of Bank of America.\nMichael Feniger: Just on pricing, you mentioned Q1 as a high watermark. And when we think of 2020 with your core price of 5.5% yield to 4%, just why would those parameters just top-down view, why wouldn't they be higher in 2023? Is that what we should be expecting, would you let your foot off the gas, maybe on the open market as the restricted reset higher next year? I guess I'm just trying to put it together with the Q1 being really strong, the high water mark yet is going to decelerate a little bit in the second half, yet how do I think about those -- that 2020 parameters as we kind of move to 2023?\nDevina Rankin: I think, well, I may have said it a couple of tons already. I do think some of it becomes about the math. And I don't intend to make it overly simple in terms of looking at that. But next year's Q1 comp will be very difficult. We do think there is benefit from the rate reset on the restricted part of the book because this year's reset didn't fully contemplate all of the inflationary impact because they are backward looking. So we think there will be another step change in that part of the business a year from now. In terms of our activity on the street, I think it's important to know we are assuming that\u2019s slowing this momentum down. So we would like to create some decrease in the cost inflation environment that would allow us to view this a little bit differently going forward. And I just want to focus on customer lifetime value. We'll always ensure that we're being data-driven and customer presence in how we push our pricing efforts.\nMichael Feniger: Very helpful. And just last one, Devina, you mentioned how the cost inflation stepped up from 7.5% in the second half to 9%. Now obviously, you guys are driving price. I'm just curious, what's kind of embedded on that full year cost inflation? Because I know there's expectations that that's going to moderate with the cost. But how should we kind of think about that plus 9% number for the full year?\nDevina Rankin: We generally look at our cost of inflation at 3% to 4%. So just the normal course would be at that level. And so you can see that we're meaningfully higher than that now. our expectation in the back half of the year isn't necessarily that we get all the way back down to 3% to 4% that we land somewhere in the teens.\nOperator: And our next question is from Kevin Chiang of CIBC.\nKevin Chiang : I'll be quick here. Congrats -- first of all all, congrats on a good quarter. Maybe just on the comments, you made it a few times, Jim, just on the data analytics and the demand from national accounts or larger customers and requiring this data as they go on their sustainability path. Is that something you charge for? Is that looking to accelerate revenue service that you're offering? And if not, does it become an ancillary revenue service? I suspect more customers are going to need to kind of track their Scope 3 emissions and their broader environmental footprint?\nJames Fish: Yes, it's a good question, Kevin. We don't currently charge kind of a separate price for it. It's packaged together in our service offering from national accounts. But it's an interesting -- it's kind of an interesting prospect that could we charge something. And it's something we've thought about, could we charge for these separate services related to data and analytics. So for today, the answer is it's a packaged deal for tomorrow, potentially something we could charge for separately.\nKevin Chiang : Okay. That's helpful. And that's kind of a follow-on question. You kind of mentioned again this is one of the levers you're pulling on to grow volumes above about what the market is doing when you're taking share. I suspect the smaller accounts that this might not be a service as appealing to them. So I suspect you're solving other pain points for customers as you grab that market share and it doesn't feel like you're getting aggressive on price to win volume. So what are some of the other pain points you might be solving for, let's say, smaller accounts that onboard with waste management if it's nothing pricing driven?\nJames Fish: I think the sustainability piece should be important to everybody, but you're right. I mean it tends to be more important to the bigger customers. When we think about the digital approach that we've taken to customer experience, that impacts everyone as well, and that may be even more heavily used with smaller customers. I refer to the airlines a lot and what they did on the front end of their operation with moving away from the call centers 20 years ago. So we're in that process now where we're digitalizing that entire customer experience and everything can be handled via your personal device or your laptop at home and you don't have to reach out to a call center. That's why we've said, look, for those positions as they as they attrit, we've made a decision to not replace many of those, and that starts in kind of Q2, Q3 of this year.\nOperator: And there are no further questions on queue. I will now turn the call over to President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames Fish: All right. Thank you. Well, I guess it goes without saying that we're very pleased with the quarter. The short-term outlook is very bright for us even with some of the economic pressures that were discussed today. But I think most importantly, we're really focused on this strategy that produces, we think, great results and differentiated results over the next 3 to 5 to even 10 years. We're excited to see the results of those. So thank you all for joining us this morning, and we'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call.Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. Our disciplined pricing programs robust volume growth and solid recycling performance fueled strong top line growth, and that translated into a nearly 11% increase in operating EBITDA in the first quarter. Our operating EBITDA growth completely flowed through to cash from operations, as lower interest payments more than offset a modest decline in working capital benefits related primarily to higher incentive compensation payments in 2022 for a strong 2021 performance. We're pleased with these strong results and are well positioned to comfortably deliver on our full year outlook. Turning to capital expenditures. First quarter capital spending to support our business totaled $371 million, and we invested an additional $47 million in our recycling and renewable energy businesses. Given our acceleration of sustainability growth in the fourth quarter of 2021, we spent a little less capital on these investments in the first quarter, but we remain on track to advance these projects in 2022 as planned. We expect that our investments in recycling and renewable natural gas projects will ramp up as we move through the balance of the year. While we continue to see supply chain constraints slow delivery schedules in some asset categories, we're managing spending across our portfolio and expect capital expenditures to support the business to be within our full year guidance of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion, and sustainability growth investments to be approximately $550 million in 2022. As you heard from Jim and John, our teams are executing on the recycling and R&D growth projects we discussed last quarter, and we're confident in the strong returns these projects provide. Keep in mind that these investments are reported as a component of our capital expenditures and reduce our traditional measure of free cash flow. Yet we view these investments to be similar to an acquisition dollar as they produce high-return growth as a strong complement to our existing business.  Putting it all together, our business generated first quarter free cash flow of $845 million. Before sustainability growth investments, first quarter free cash flow was $892 million, which puts us well on our way to achieving our full year outlook of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. We are well positioned to allocate our cash to sustainability growth investments, traditional tuck-in acquisitions and growing shareholder returns. We used our free cash flow to pay $275 million in dividends in the quarter, and we allocated $250 million to share repurchases, while maintaining our leverage ratio well within our targeted range. Turning to SG&A. We remain focused on controlling discretionary SG&A spending and leveraging technology investments to reduce the cost of our sales and back office functions. First quarter SG&A was 10.1% of revenue, a 60 basis point improvement over 2021. We fully expect to achieve SG&A as a percentage of revenue of less than 10% for the full year, even as we continue to invest in technology to differentiate WM and lower our cost to serve. In closing, our strong results are a testament to the dedication of our 50,000 team members. We're proud of our performance in the first quarter and excited about what we can achieve together over the remainder of the year. With that, Lorrie, let's open the line for questions. And then, Toni, with regard to our process on labor to advance the projects that we've discussed in sustainability and recycling. One of the things that's unique about WM is that we started this journey with a really strong team that's been developing these projects over the last several years, and we're leveraging that team and building it where appropriate in order to accelerate the investment from here, and we're really satisfied with where that stands. And Jerry, just to put a fine point on how we're thinking about the build of financial value from these plants, our 2022 guidance did contemplate the two facilities that we're bringing online in 2022. And because of the timing of bringing them online, it really did have a pretty inconsequential impact, particularly the one that comes in the fourth quarter. But we do expect a step change in 2023, and we'll give you more clarity on that as we get closer to that point. At this point, it's too early for us to give you those details. We are actively pulling in the equipments and the permitting processes. And because of the uncertainty in those processes, we just can't predict at this point with the same level of certainty that we've given you for 2022, what we expect in the year ahead. But as we get closer to those dates, we certainly will. It's a great question, Hamzah, and one that we're focused on internally in terms of how we'll manage this over the long term as this becomes a larger part of our business. Volatility in the natural gas business will certainly increase relative to the traditional solid waste business. That volatility, though, only comes from the top line of the business. There really is no volatility in the middle of the income statement. And so for us, it's about how we evaluate every vantage point of the revenue life cycle and think about what we're exposed to in spot markets and what we can secure long-term contracts for. And we are currently addressing some long-term contracts. We've discussed the fact that some of those are extending beyond even 10 years at this point. We want to ensure that while we consider long-term contracts, we don't somehow diminish the return of the portfolio because we are making sizable investments here. We want to be sure that we're appropriately balancing ourselves between spot market and the long term to maximize the returns. So on the price side, I would tell you, our expectations had been when we set our guidance that we would see stronger price performance and volume performance in the first half of the year than the second half of the year, simply because of the year-over-year comp. We continue to see that math holds. And that, therefore, means that as we look at both the guidance we established and where we are today, that we expect Q1 to be the peak, I would say, in terms of the print on core price and on yields. That being said, if I look purely at the numbers, I would tell you, we were about 100 basis points, maybe a little higher than that, above our expectations on core price. On the volume side, they were stronger than expectations, particularly in special waste. The rest of the business really performed according to plan. It was. It was just generally, speaking in line with what we would have projected for the year, we're really optimistic that the commercial volume strength continues. But as John remarked earlier, the special waste volumes is one of the things that we have our eye on, because approaching 30% increase on a year-over-year basis, certainly isn't something that we had predicted. Well, a quick clarification on the $90 million on the fuel surcharge line, it's important to note that, that also includes renewable energy pricing. So the fuel surcharge was about $70 million of the $90 million. That being said, March was about 45% of the quarter. And so the ramp that you mentioned was significant, and we continue to expect that will persist through the remainder of the year. Our prediction right now is $90 million to $100 million per quarter. John did a great job of talking about the supply chain constraints. And so while we would love to give you some clarity on the cadence of capital for us right now, it's just more difficult for us to predict quarter by quarter, particularly for truck capital where we're seeing delivery schedules lengthen. I would tell you, Q2 is usually the point in time that we start to see ramp, particularly in the landfill line of business. And so you'll see that -- I do expect Q4 to be a pretty heavy capital quarter again, though, for us. So I think you can take our guidance for each of them and make it pretty ratable over Q2 through Q4. It was closer to 9%. No. We think that this is effectively the peak, and we expect it to plateau and then as we discussed, we expect to see some moderation in the back half because we'll lap the labor increases that we executed upon beginning in the third quarter of '21. Yes, that's correct, Michael. So it's really interesting when you look at the margin of the quarter, it certainly outperformed our expectation, and that started at the top line and continued through in terms of managing costs, which John mentioned earlier, particularly on the labor side. I think what's important is that you normalize for the fuel tax credit first because that really gets us focused on the rest of the business and how we've performed. And that was 30 basis points. And so when you look at Q1's performance, and you can see that we were only down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis, and that compares to our expectation that we'd be down about 100 basis in the first half. We're certainly very pleased with that performance. The overall puts and takes just to build the bridge is that I would tell you the positive drivers from a margin perspective in the quarter were 20 basis points from the renewable energy business, about 10 basis points for leverage on SG&A beyond expectations. Recycling, this is the brokerage business. It's led by the brokerage business. It includes all elements of the recycling line of business, but that was down 30 basis points on a year-over-year basis. And then the collection and disposal business overall was down 30 basis points. But what's really important to highlight there is that sequentially improved 50 basis points when you remove the impact of the fuel tax credit. So we're really pleased with that performance, and it outpaced our expectations. We still remain cautious about margin in the first half of the year relative to prior year because as a reminder, Q2 of last year was, I believe, an all-time high at 29.3%. So we still expect margins in the first half to be on a year-over-year basis, a more difficult comp and therefore, a decrease, but we expect the margin momentum that we began in the first quarter to continue throughout the year. So I'm going to separate fuel tax credits and the impact of rising fuel costs. But fuel tax credit, I would tell you, we hope, is a timing difference. Our outlook right now is that, that 30 basis points may continue, and we would love to see resolution sooner rather than later, but we think it could go all the way through the fourth quarter, but we do expect that to be a timing issue only not contribute to the margin of the business overall. From a diesel fuel rising cost perspective, we certainly saw that impact in the first quarter. And like I said earlier, at ramp in March, we estimate that the impact of that for every dollar change in diesel fuel is about 20 basis points of margin pressure. So Tyler, I think the easiest way to look at it, we don't have specific breakdowns between open market and restricted prices. But what we've talked about is with rate restricted pricing, we do reset about 70% of that in the first half. And so those resets being loaded toward the first half is one of the reasons that we expect the high watermark to exist in the first half relative to the second half, and then it comes back to those comps. What I would say is that our pricing on The Street continues to have momentum over the course of the year as our contracts come up, particularly on open market and some of the actions that we took and the impact of fuel that we discussed will certainly continue to drive price higher. That's not reflected in your collection and disposal yields. But I really do think that this comes down to being focused on our market-based pricing and knowing that, that momentum is not what's flowing, it's just the comparisons on a year-over-year basis and the fact that we started to take pricing action more reflective of the cost environment in the second half of last year. And then on the incentive compensation and health and welfare specifically, what I would tell you is I do think that incentive compensation could modestly increase over the remainder of the year from the Q1 level, just as we get further into the year, we'll get finer on our estimates and outlook and therefore, the accruals. But with regard to health and welfare, we are seeing the trends of those costs return to pre-COVID levels, where medical activity is getting back to normal. And as a result, those costs are pretty well in line with what we would have expected. They do tend to moderate over the remainder of the year, but nothing unusual on a year-over-year basis. So Sean, I think fundamentally, what this comes back to is us not wanting to be in a position to revise guidance across the board after just one quarter. And so the overall trend that we expected where our first half comps are just going to be tougher from a margin perspective than the second half comps. And therefore, we will relatively underperform our full year outlook in the first half and see a build as we get into the third quarter in terms of margin performance still holds.  In terms of the magnitude of it, I think Tyler's question earlier about the impact of fuel, framing that as about a 20 to 40 basis point impact, given what we're seeing in diesel fuels, we're pretty satisfied that we're going to be able to absorb the negative impacts of that. And so when we look at full year outlook for margin, we do see some upside particularly because price has come in so strong and we've seen positive momentum on retention. It's just too early for us to update the specificity with regard to how we see that flowing through for the rest of the year. Yes. So it was $12 million for the quarter. The full year impact is expected to be a little north of $55 million. So the impact for the remainder of the year, we estimate to be about $45 million. We fully expect that we'll end the year with some clarity on this. But if we don't receive that clarity, it would be about a $55 million to $60 million negative impact relative to the guidance that we've provided. I don't have the specifics on that. Ed and Heather will be able to get you more color. The only thing that we provide is the year-over-year increase in that was $13 million of a year-over-year benefit in the quarter. The color there I would give you is that we estimate that for every $0.10 change in RIN values, we see a $4 million to $5 million change in our EBITDA, and that continues to hold through 2022, we will see that increase as we get into '23 with additional production. I think, well, I may have said it a couple of tons already. I do think some of it becomes about the math. And I don't intend to make it overly simple in terms of looking at that. But next year's Q1 comp will be very difficult. We do think there is benefit from the rate reset on the restricted part of the book because this year's reset didn't fully contemplate all of the inflationary impact because they are backward looking. So we think there will be another step change in that part of the business a year from now. In terms of our activity on the street, I think it's important to know we are assuming that's slowing this momentum down. So we would like to create some decrease in the cost inflation environment that would allow us to view this a little bit differently going forward. And I just want to focus on customer lifetime value. We'll always ensure that we're being data-driven and customer presence in how we push our pricing efforts. We generally look at our cost of inflation at 3% to 4%. So just the normal course would be at that level. And so you can see that we're meaningfully higher than that now. our expectation in the back half of the year isn't necessarily that we get all the way back down to 3% to 4% that we land somewhere in the teens."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. 2022 began on a high note with first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business topping 9%. Our expectation was that the first quarter would be our strongest quarter of the year, both for pricing and volume growth, and our teams delivered revenue that exceeded our expectations. Core price of 7.3% is more than double the result for the same quarter in 2021, as we work to secure price increases that keep pace with the inflationary environment. Strong pricing results across all lines of business translated into collection and disposal yield of 5.5%, with standout performance of 7.9% for commercial and 5.1% for landfill MSW. We remain confident that our pricing strategies appropriately respond to the rising costs and prioritize our focus on maximizing customer lifetime value. In the first quarter, we delivered record high core price, while maintaining churn near historic lows by using a data-driven and customer-focused approach. Shifting to volumes, first quarter collection and disposal volume grew 3.8%. Landfill volumes continue to be strong, with MSW volumes increasing more than 5% and special waste volumes growing almost 30% in the quarter. And while we expect some moderation in special waste volumes from our first quarter levels, our project pipelines remain strong. Also contributing to our strong volume results was significant growth in our national account business. In the first quarter, our Strategic Business Solutions team won more than $20 million of new annualized revenue. These wins were driven by our ability to meet customer sustainability and operating needs through a differentiated use of customer-facing data analytics and service capabilities. Our teams remain focused on controlling operating costs. Overall, adjusted operating expenses were 62.3% of revenue in the first quarter. While cost inflation in the first quarter persisted in the high single digits, our operating costs improved 70 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to encouraging trends in our largest cost category, labor. First quarter overtime costs and training hours came down compared to the fourth quarter of 2021, as we've improved retention and been successful in onboarding new team members to transition from training hours to productive hours. On a year-over-year basis, the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue primarily comes from 3 areas: 50 basis points in our collection and disposal business related to inflationary pressures, including the proactive and intentional steps we took last year to increase wages for frontline team members; 40 basis points from the impact of higher commodity prices on our recycling brokerage business; and 30 points related to the alternative fuel tax credits received in 2021 that have not yet been renewed for 2022. When we think about the balance of the year, we expect the inflationary cost pressures to ease in the second half of 2022 as we lap acute inflation that began in the second half of 2021. We do anticipate some pressure on maintenance costs in 2022 as a result of delays in our truck delivery schedule resulting from ongoing supply chain constraints. Turning to our residential collection business, we continue to execute on our long-term plan to improve this line of business through pricing and automation. The impacts of higher labor costs are most pronounced in this part of the business, and we are focused on appropriately pricing our contracts and reducing our costs by transitioning more of our residential fleet to automated single-driver vehicles. Our first quarter revenue growth results reflect our success in moving residential pricing as our yield was 5%. In the recycling line of business, we delivered another strong quarter with operating EBITDA growing by $23 million. Our blended average commodity price in the first quarter was about $126 per ton, which is in line with our full year expectations. We continue to see strong demand for recycled materials, and we remain focused on educating customers to help unlock additional supply of recyclables and employing technology to maximize the value of the material recovery while reducing our cost of processing. And finally, our renewable energy business contributed an additional $13 million of operating EBITDA in the quarter. We have a new renewable natural gas plant coming online in the next few weeks in Oklahoma, the 17th R&D plant in our network and the fifth developed by WM. The next RNG project is on track to come into service by the end of the year, positioning us to deliver on our 2026 targets as we expand our leadership in the landfill gas energy business. In closing, I want to thank the entire team for the fantastic job they do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a great start to 2022 and look forward to building on our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. No, Toni. We've seen some increases in overtime, which I've honestly moderated over the last couple of quarters. So that's good news. We've been successful in bringing down our turnover numbers. They're not where we want them to be, but they're about 300 basis points better than they were 2 quarters ago. So we're seeing good trends overall on the labor front.  We were, to some extent, paint a little bit of a premium to service some of that business a few quarters ago as the overtime was up, but the good news is that's moderating. Our overtime percentages are coming down, our retention rates are better. So we feel pretty good about where we are and our ability to service any of these volume opportunities that present themselves. Yes. So I can't speak to the sector. What I can tell you, though, is there's a couple of those metrics we pay close attention to. One is churn, which in my comments, I said, is still near historical lows. So we haven't seen really a lot of movement there even when you look at the pricing that we posted for the quarter. We look at service increases and decreases as also a measurement of the health and those continue to be positive in a big way. And then lastly, the metric we look at is rollbacks. And I will tell you that rollbacks are much stronger year-over-year. So even as we've addressed this -- and I think we all agree that customers understand that there is real inflationary pressure. And I think that's -- that, coupled with the value in terms of service we're delivering is the reason why you're seeing rollbacks even lower despite us having push through more on the revenue quality side. Yes, Michael. We've executed a handful of contracts being commented. One was around a 10-year mark, one was a little longer than that. And the short answer to your question is yes. It's a small percentage of the gas we produce now. We're going to continue as Devina said, to look to stabilize the portfolio by putting a portion of those contracts in a fixed position. But the short answer is yes, people are willing to buy and yes, they're willing to pay a premium on an MMBtu basis. I'll start the operating side, Devina can weigh in maybe the SG&A and benefit side. I would -- we spoke to labor, obviously, been a long pole in the tent continuing to see high single, low double-digit inflation on labor. I think it's most pronounced. We mentioned in the residential line of business, most labor-intense line of business that we have. I would tell you, maintenance, in my prepared comments, David, we think that if there are some supply chain disruptions that linger through the balance of the year, we may be in a position where we're going to keep some of our older fleet employed for a little bit longer until we catch up. We don't see that as a barrier to be able to take advantage of some of the volume and market share that Jim commented on, it may put a little pressure on OpEx versus CapEx. But as Devina said, it's early in the year, and we've got a little bit of time here before I think we need to pivot. That would be one spot in the P&L where you might see it on the operating side. So David, the MRFs that we're automating are certainly producing a better product and doing it more efficiently. And I think that model actually gets better with the labor increases we're seeing, right? We're employing less labor in these plants. The rates are going up. So the investments we were talking about 18 months, 24 months ago and upgrading these plants is actually printing better not just because the arbitrage has gotten better, the quality of the product coming out of these facilities is better when you use a mechanized process to pull that material out. It stands to reason that you would get a better, cleaner product coming out of there. I think on the pricing side, what we're seeing is very consistent and strong demand on the fiber side, mixed paper has been a good tailwind over the last couple of years, and we're seeing continued demand increase for some of the other streams, the plastic streams. So we feel good about the top line and the demand that's being created. And as I mentioned, that's something we're going to continue to do is to educate our customers and use technology to unlock some of those streams. I would tell you in terms of negative value, the one that probably stand, I mean there's a residual content that tracks in the high teens to about 20%. We've been working on getting that down over the last few years. We feel technology will continue to help us in that regard. It's really the residual piece and glass, right? There's not really any positive market for glass. There's an environmental benefit to arguably keeping it out of the stream, but there's not a market that's positive for glass at the moment.  Did I catch all your questions? So I would tell you, Noah, where we have the opportunity to do a mid-contract we're going as fast as we can. We're not waiting, so to speak, for contracts to roll. I think a lot of municipalities we're having some really productive discussions with them because they've seen whether that we're a service provider or not, that's a strain on labor is showing up in the ability to service some of these municipalities, and we've seen opportunities to step in and convert these mid-contract. And certainly, to the extent that we are not able to do that, there is that period of time when these municipalities or franchises are going out for RFP and we're trying to make sure we're in front of that to have productive and educational conversations, if you will, about what the benefits are of automating these services. Absolutely. I think for the municipality, you bring up a good point, when you go to kind of the pick up everything at the curb model to a containerized model, it helps in terms of the municipalities understanding, managing their costs and the quality material on the recycling side. And I think I won't go down this rapid trail, but all the technology we put on the trucks becomes that much more valuable when you automate the service, and we've got the ability to look at each of these transactions to help educate these customers."

            "name": "James Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The first quarter of every year sets the tone for the rest of the year, and our strong first quarter results really set us up for success in 2022. We delivered exceptional core price and yield results, grew profitable volumes and managed our costs. The result was double-digit growth in revenue, operating EBITDA and cash from operations. In fact, our cash from operations was the highest we've ever generated in a quarter, allowing us to return $0.5 billion of cash to our shareholders. Our operating EBITDA margin of 27.6% was ahead of our plan, even in the face of record inflation and the delayed approval of the alternative fuel tax credits. So we executed extremely well in the first quarter and achieved better results than we anticipated, positioning 2022 to be another great year for WM. In addition to the strong start in the first quarter, we see signs that the economy is trending positively. Several of the key leading performance indicators within our business, such as special waste volumes, construction and demolition volumes and new business formation pointed to continued strong economic activity and business performance for the balance of the year. The positive economic activity, combined with WM's diverse customer base, the recession-resilient nature of our business and nearly 75% of our revenue that is annuity-like, gives us confidence to reaffirm the full year outlook we provided in February. As we progress through the year, we remain committed to executing on our strategic priorities of providing the best workplace, advancing technology and automation that differentiates WM and reduces costs and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth. Turning to our sustainability and technology investments, we're excited about the future. We see the opportunity to further our sustainability leadership by expanding recycling capacity, automating recycling processing and increasing the renewable energy generated from our landfill network. We opened a new recycling facility in the first quarter and we're on track to bring online another fully retrofitted MRF in the second quarter, along with the next WM-built renewable natural gas plant. These projects are expected to generate excellent returns that are superior to those of solid waste acquisitions. Regarding technology, last quarter, you heard us discuss cost-saving opportunities for automation and optimization, which involves creating a competitive advantage for WM by differentiating the customer experience, while reducing our labor dependency on certain roles. Through our focus on digital technology, we anticipate reducing 5,000 to 7,000 positions over the next 4 years. In this tight and expensive job market, it makes complete sense to use technology to reduce our dependency on certain high turnover jobs. In addition to tackling this attrition, technology produces a significant amount of data that we view as a valuable asset. John has referred to our trucks as rolling data centers and we're using that data and analytics to create a sustainable competitive advantage. Currently, we're piloting the full end-to-end optimization of our roll-off routes, which will be the first of its kind in the industry. Early efficiency results in our pilots are very encouraging and our plan is to have our roll-off routes fully optimized by mid-'23. Finally, while we use automation and data to our advantage, we will invest in training and upskilling of our existing employees to -- existing employees to ready them for higher-skilled future roles. To sum it up, we've set the bar high in our first quarter with our results, and we're confident in our ability to deliver strong performance throughout the remainder of 2022. I want to thank the entire WM team for their hard work and dedication. I know that they continue to work to deliver on our commitment to our customers, our communities and our shareholders. And we very much appreciate that. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. I think, Toni, the last year was actually a little unique for us. I think it was the first year we've ever raised guidance in the first quarter. And so we didn't want to set a trend necessarily. I think we felt like the quarter was fantastic, sets us up well for the year. But before we would change that outlook, we wanted to get another quarter or 2 under our belts. Yes. Look, I would tell you, for the quarter, we were pleased with the results from a price perspective, considering that we talked about a 4% yield and 5.5% core price. As you know, things do moderate a little bit as we get later in the year just because the comps change. So you shouldn't expect to see the same raw numbers in Q3, Q4 because of the difficult comparisons. But we certainly have, I think, shown that we're pretty effective at using price to cover the cost inflation. I think it's also important that we focus on the cost side of the business, and that's why we're starting to really talk a lot about technology. I mentioned this 5,000 to 7,000 jobs, that's in a low-cost way, meaning we use attrition to take them out, that will be a significant contributor as we go down the road. So we're not just relying solely on price to improve margins. Some of it has to come from the cost side of the equation, it's going to be a combination of things that I think get us on a significant margin improvement path. Yes, Jerry, I'm not going to say that there isn't a single customer out of our $25 million that didn't get 2 price increases, but we've really, really tried to move away almost completely from that. And I hope that there aren't any, but -- what we're trying to do is when we take a price increase on customers, make it an annual thing. And so I can't say with 1,000% confidence that something didn't slip through the cracks. But I would tell you that that may have been a practice from years ago, but that practice has changed. So that pricing is more of an annual item for our customers. Yes, Jerry. I mean most of those plants have infrastructure in place already. So we're managing that gas. In most cases, the difference is we're switching over from the technology we were using to manage the gas to an RNG process. So once the plant is up and we've kind of knocked the kinks out, if you will, it comes up to speed fairly quickly. None of these are landfills where we're starting with no infrastructure, if that were the case, it would be different, but that's not our situation. Yes, that's right. Well, that's right. And I think the point about the price increase being once a year is that there may be some price that's still on the table out there because we didn't take price increases as aggressively in March of last year or in April of last year. So those will come around. I mean inflation didn't really kind of hit us hard until Q3. So you will see some pickup there that we didn't choose to take, even though that customer may have -- that the cost for that -- for servicing that customer have increased dramatically in Q3, Q4, the price wouldn't have mirrored that until we get to the anniversary this year. Well, I think commercial was very strong too, on the volume, Scott. I don't know -- Michael, sometimes we talk a little bit about what the current month looks like. And we're not seeing anything that would change our view right now in April. There was -- definitely special waste was a strong point. But the great thing about the quarter, if we're really focusing on just kind of this short-term quarter and then the remainder of the year is that we kind of had universal strength. And I'm not sure we've had a quarter like this where virtually everything looked good. I mean even C&D, you might look at C&D and say, \"Well, that was flat.\" But if you look at last year with all the fire and flood volume in it, if you pull that out, C&D was really strong on its own. So whether it's MSW volume or commercial volume or special waste or C&D, everything looks strong. We are keeping our eye on the macro economy because there's a lot of chatter out there about that. But we're not seeing any signals right now in those forward-looking waste streams that would indicate that there's a big downturn coming. And believe me, we're looking at it. Nothing shows up right now. I think what structurally is changing versus maybe previous quarters is that we're starting to really separate ourselves, I believe, from the pack. So it's not just driven by micro and macroeconomics, it's driven by the fact that WM is -- we don't tend to -- we tend to on these calls talk a lot about kind of short term, the outlook and what the quarter looked like and what the remainder of the year is going to look like. But we also tried to inject in a bit of what we're doing strategically. And I would tell you, Walter, we're making huge strides in digitalizing our customer service. It's something the airlines did years ago, and now we're doing that. And it is separating us from a lot of others in the industry. We believe we're taking share. I believe that's part of what you're seeing in the volume picture. I can't break it out for you by line of business, but as we do that, and we believe that's kind of a 3, 5, even a 10-year strategy, similar to what we're talking about with sustainability, there's an awful lot of customers out there that are talking to us about data and analytics for their own sustainability initiatives. And we're really the only one that can provide that level that they're asking for. Nobody else can do that. So I would tell you this is not just about micro 101, this is about not only microeconomics, but it's also about the strategy we're putting in place that I believe is absolutely taking share and will take more share as we further differentiate ourselves down the road. That's absolutely right. I mean, look, the short story is, that's why I'm still bullish on this company. Obviously, I'm biased, but I got to tell you, I mean, I'm really bullish on it even at $160. I mean it's -- the strategy to me, whether you're talking about the brand that can't be matched, the labor -- the reduction of labor dependency, which doesn't address the volume aspect, but addresses the cost aspect and using the digitalization customer experience and to help us reduce our labor dependency by 5,000 to 7,000 jobs hasn't gotten a lot of comments from investors, but that's a big deal. And so all of that, I think, helps separate us from others who just simply can't replicate that. Yes. I mean, look, we've seen the rumors. And I would tell you this, we're -- just as I went through with you kind of our strategy, which is really an organic strategy, we're really pleased with the results of our organic strategy. And at the same time, we'll continue to look at some of the small tuck-ins we may do, something that's an adjacency. We've talked about those as well that are related to our sustainability strategy. And that's probably where we draw the line as far as M&A goes. I will tell you that, in my view, there are reasons today to be conservative when it comes to M&A. It goes back to what I said about us being differentiated. Some of these other haulers, by the way, some of them are talking to us that have pressures on driver and technician turnover, significant pressures on driver technician turnover that are absolutely seeing wage inflation there, they're having a difficult time getting capital equipment probably times 2 versus where we are. And they don't have a sustainability service offering that is now being requested. Those are reasons to not go out and pay a big, heavy multiple to acquire some of these folks. To my previous point to Walter about margin, there seems to be a real focus on pricing, which is the right focus. But when you think about margin, there's a cost aspect too. And then so just to give you a couple of examples, we fully expect that with the digitalization of our customer experience, for example, that we have built into our plan that we won't rehire some customer experience positions, I talked to Mike Watson about this morning and -- so we've built that into our plan, probably as many as 300 positions that won't rehire when they trade away. So this isn't laying anybody off, this is just saying when we have 50% turnover in some of those positions and calls come through our call centers that are asking for ETA or asking for status of a payment or a bulky pickup, those have fully been automated. And so we've agreed that we won't replace those positions and that amounts to somewhere in the neighborhood of 300 positions for the year that we built into our plan. Similarly, with this move from rear load to ASL, we think there's as many as 2,000 of those that over the next 4 years, come out. And so you get a helper on the back of the truck that comes out, but you also get -- we know this from experience, a 30% pickup in efficiency when you move from rear load to ASL.  The Brent Bell is taking out positions as we automate these plants, somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 positions net and I say that because we'll be upskilling some positions there. So that includes both positions coming out and then positions being added back. And the net of that is somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,000 to 1,200 positions over the next 4 years. And some of those do start hitting us in 2022 and then really accelerate in 2023. All of that, in addition to what we're doing on price, will have an impact on margins. I think it was about $180 million in 2021. But Ed and Heather can verify that, but I think it was about $180 million. Well, when we talk specifically about national accounts, I mentioned that data and analytics are very important to them. They all have sustainability initiatives, every one of them. And so when we think about renewing some of these big national accounts that we renewed or signing new accounts, one of their primary asks is what kind of reporting tools do you have that can provide the information on a store-by-store basis, for example. So that's critically important, and that's been a real differentiator for us. When you think about the returns, Noah, I mean, it's a pretty easy math equation. On the negative side of the ledger, you get a higher capital cost for an ASL versus a rear loader to the tune of about $60,000, maybe 20% of the cost of the vehicle. But on the positive side, obviously, you get a helper coming off the back, put whatever number you want on that. And that is perpetual, whereas the capital cost is a onetime cost for the life of the vehicle. And then you get a safety improvement. You get a 30% -- as I mentioned, a 30% pickup in productivity or efficiency because we're just -- we're picking up 30% more homes per hour with an ASL than over a reloader. So the math is really compelling. It makes sense for us to move as quickly as we can on John's point. Yes, it's a good question, Kevin. We don't currently charge kind of a separate price for it. It's packaged together in our service offering from national accounts. But it's an interesting -- it's kind of an interesting prospect that could we charge something. And it's something we've thought about, could we charge for these separate services related to data and analytics. So for today, the answer is it's a packaged deal for tomorrow, potentially something we could charge for separately. I think the sustainability piece should be important to everybody, but you're right. I mean it tends to be more important to the bigger customers. When we think about the digital approach that we've taken to customer experience, that impacts everyone as well, and that may be even more heavily used with smaller customers. I refer to the airlines a lot and what they did on the front end of their operation with moving away from the call centers 20 years ago. So we're in that process now where we're digitalizing that entire customer experience and everything can be handled via your personal device or your laptop at home and you don't have to reach out to a call center. That's why we've said, look, for those positions as they as they attrit, we've made a decision to not replace many of those, and that starts in kind of Q2, Q3 of this year. All right. Thank you. Well, I guess it goes without saying that we're very pleased with the quarter. The short-term outlook is very bright for us even with some of the economic pressures that were discussed today. But I think most importantly, we're really focused on this strategy that produces, we think, great results and differentiated results over the next 3 to 5 to even 10 years. We're excited to see the results of those. So thank you all for joining us this morning, and we'll talk to you next quarter."

Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJames C. Fish: All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered a remarkably strong finish to 2023 driving fourth operating EBITDA 15% higher. This accelerated earnings growth led to full-year operating EBITDA that exceeded the high-end of our most recent guidance range by nearly $25 million and achieved the midpoint of our original expectations from the beginning of the year. Our strong financial results for both the quarter and the year were powered by our collection and disposal business. This performance starts with disciplined organic revenue growth that exceeded our expectations. And once again, our success in managing the middle of the P&L really stands out in our results, as our teams continue to make progress in optimizing our cost structure with the help of technology and automation. When you combine our revenue performance with the improvement in operating costs, we saw widening of our price-to-cost spread and increased profitability. Operating EBITDA margin reached a record 29.9% in the fourth quarter and full-year margin expanded 90 basis points 28.9%. As 2024 kicks-off, we're confident that our continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and executing on sustainability growth projects sets us up for another year of outsized growth. We anticipate operating EBITDA growth of 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, which translates to more than $450 million of which $115 million comes directly from our sustainability growth investments. We remain excited about the economic and environmental benefits of expanding our renewable natural gas and recycling platforms. Our execution is tracking well and we expect to commission five new renewable natural gas facilities by the end of the year reaching 30% of our run rate renewable natural gas volume growth. We're also on-track to complete automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities and add three recycling facilities in new markets in 2024. Turning to capital allocation, you'll hear from Devina, on this topic in more detail, but I want to stress our confidence and our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities. This includes investing in our high-return sustainability growth projects, acquiring accretive businesses and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our tuck-in acquisition pipeline is robust, and there are some indications that 2024 could have heightened activity in this regard. We're committed to a disciplined approach to acquiring companies ensuring that any deals we pursue yield appropriate returns particularly given the high-returns in sustainability opportunities. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another great year. We were just at the WM Phoenix Open last week and I've said before, we work hard for this event to create a representation of the bigger company with a central focus on people and the environment. We've been the title sponsor for 15 years now and the tournament's been recognized as the largest zero waste sporting event in the world for 12 years running. It makes me proud to see the WM team out there making waste diversion operations run smoothly and demonstrating our sustainability leadership so well. I look forward to working with this great team in 2024 as we continue to drive growth by executing our operating plans and progressing our investments in technology, automation and sustainability. I'll now turn the call over to John, to discuss our operational results.\nJohn J. Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We're more than pleased with the strong operational performance our team achieved in 2023 showing continuous improvement throughout the year with standout results in the fourth quarter. During this period, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 240 basis points year-over-year landing at 60.3% and marking our second best quarterly performance ever. This improvement was primarily fueled by our collection and disposal business benefiting from the robust operating leverage of our strategic cost optimization. Our proactive measures to accelerate and improve cost efficiency included leveraging technology to manage labor, managing repair and maintenance costs and optimizing our overall cost structure. These initiatives led to a substantial improvement in WM's cost to serve metrics, bringing estimated unit cost inflation to low-single-digits by the fourth quarter. When combined with solid results from our pricing initiatives, we greatly enhanced overall margins. Our strong second half performance translated into full-year operating expenses as a percentage of revenue of 61.7%, an improvement of 70 basis points. That momentum has carried into 2024 and is evident in our January results even as we face severe weather in some areas we serve. Two of the key cost categories driving our operating improvements are labor and repair and maintenance. On the labor front, this begins with our persistent focus on reducing turnover. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a noteworthy milestone as driver turnover reaches lowest point at 18.4%, showing improvement as the year progressed. Additionally, our strategic automation initiatives are yielding positive results in collection efficiency with all three lines of business improving meaningfully in the fourth quarter compared to last year. The results of our technology and automation investments gained traction in the latter part of 2023, leading to significant strides in labor cost management. We expect this to continue into 2024 as we broaden the deployment of our tools across additional sites. Turning to repair and maintenance, with a full lot of trucks received in 2023, we successfully removed over a 1,000 excess assets from our operation, improve the age of our routed fleet and reduce truck rental utilization by nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023. Throughout 2023, our emphasis remained on streamlining maintenance processes, which has resulted in enhanced technician productivity, reduced overtime expenses and diminished reliance on external repair services. This is paid off in the form of lower repair and maintenance costs in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. We accomplished all this with an unwavering commitment to safety and by enhancing the quality of our fleet. We're proud of the strides we made throughout 2023 and look forward to sustained progress. Another core element of the equation that fueled our strong financial results is disciplined organic revenue growth. Growth from price and volume in the collection and disposal business totaled 6.3% for the year, which outpaced our expectations. Our pricing programs continue to be focused on striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. Our full-year churn rates remain at the lower-end of historical range at about 9% and the year-over-year improvement underscores our consistent delivery of quality service to our customers. Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate sustained momentum in our disciplined pricing programs to result in core price between 6% and 6.5% and yield approaching 5%. We remain committed to maximizing customer lifetime value up while securing pricing that exceeds our cost inflation. We've seen that spread improve as 2023 progressed and we are confident that our teams are poised to deliver another successful year ahead. Turning to volumes, our fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 1.9% on a workday adjusted basis. Growth was primarily driven by MSW landfill and commercial collection, two bellwethers for demand of our services. Overall growth in landfill volumes was somewhat muted due to the elevated volumes from the Hurricane Ian clean up in 2022. Some of the recent quarters, residential collection volumes declined modestly due to our intentional shedding of low margin contracts as we work to ensure that we achieved acceptable returns for all parts of our business. You can see the benefits of this focus because while our residential collection volumes declined, total revenue and earnings in this line of business both improved. This is a winning equation and we'll continue to execute on the strategy in the year ahead. Organic revenue growth in all collection lines of business remains as positive and operating EBITDA continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, new business grew and net services increases remain firmly positive reflecting our quality of service and focused differentiation. Looking ahead to 2024, our guidance anticipates collection and disposal volume approaching 1%, mirroring the performance achieved in 2023. And finally, I want to convey my appreciation to our frontline teams for their unwavering commitment to delivering safe and reliable service to our customers and communities on a daily basis. It's their efforts that made 2023 successful and laid the groundwork for growth in the years ahead. I will now turn the call over to Devina, to discuss our 2023 financial results and 2024 financial outlook in greater detail.\nDevina A. Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Cost optimization was a significant theme in the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. Our team was pleased that our collective focus delivered WM's best ever full-year SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 9.4%. The 20 basis point improvement from prior year was realized through investments in customer facing technology, leveraging enhanced back office systems to become more efficient and a continuous focus on optimizing our spend. We're pleased with the progress made to improve this measure, while at the same time investing in our talent, customer engagement channels and technology capabilities. SG&A optimization delivered 20 basis points of our 90 basis point expansion and adjusted operating EBITDA margin in 2023. The remaining 70 basis points was from the collection and disposal business, which benefited from a combination of fuel price impacts and operating efficiencies. We gained meaningful traction in optimizing labor efficiency and repair and maintenance costs in our collection disposal business in the back half of the year, lifting our full-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin to 28.9%. This result is 30 basis points ahead of the high-end of our expectations and positions us to continue to deliver margin expansion in the year ahead. Our operating performance translated into robust cash flow in 2023. Our full-year cash flow from operations grew to $4.719 billion and our free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was nearly $2.7 billion. Each of these cash flow measures finished the year near the high-end of our initial guidance range. This result demonstrates our strong earnings growth, effective management of interest and taxes and optimizing cash conversion and our disciplined capital expenditure management processes. During 2023, we returned $2.44 billion to shareholders, paying $1.14 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.3 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $173 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability growth investments for future growth and development and maintaining our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times. Our balance sheet remains strong and our earnings and cash flow growth are robust, positioning us to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth. Moving to our 2024 financial outlook, we're anticipating total company revenue growth between 6% and 7%, driven by organic growth in the collection and disposal business approaching 6%. Operating EBITDA is expected to grow by $450 million at the midpoint of our outlook. When we think about the cadence of our growth over the course of the year, we're expecting collection and disposal growth to be weighted more to the front half of the year, given the momentum we've gained from strong operating efficiencies in back half of 2023. And we're expecting sustainability business growth to be more significantly weighted to the back half of the year as our new recycling and renewable natural gas projects come online. Altogether, we expect this to result in a relatively balanced operating EBITDA growth over the course of the year. We expect capital spending to support the business for the year to total $2.25 billion of midpoint and we expect to invest another $875 million on our high-return sustainability growth projects. Free cash flow before these sustainability investments is anticipated to grow almost 7% at the midpoint to $2.85 billion. We remain committed to investing in an industry leading network of renewable energy and recycling assets, including renewable natural gas projects through recycling automation and new markets and advancements in resource recovery. Our sustainability growth investment strategy is progressing well. So, as you would expect, there have been a number of refinements to the plan since its inception. We've worked our way through customary changes to project schedules and impacts from inflation, all the while delivering completed projects that meet and sometimes exceed the environmental and economic objectives we planned. These successes have positioned us to grow the sustainability project pipeline. In particular, our refreshed outlook includes two new recycling projects in Canada that WM has awarded through a competitive process. We now expect growth investments across our recycling and renewable energy platforms to total between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion from 2022 through 2026. We expect these projects to contribute run rate adjusted operating EBITDA of about $800 million by the end of 2026. This outlook utilizes the same pricing assumptions we've used consistently, a $125 per ton for recycled commodities and $26 per MMBtu for renewable natural gas. We have a great deal of confidence in the value of the projects that are underway and we're enthusiastic about the strong complement they provide to our existing business. In conclusion, 2023 has clearly illustrated that we are driving growth through our diligent focus on optimizing our business, investing in technology and automation, and growing our leadership and sustainability. We take pride in our accomplishments and look forward to what we can achieve together in 2024. A heartfelt thank you to our dedicated team members who have been instrumental to our success. With that, Josh, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. You may proceed.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. First one maybe for, John. You talked in some good details about some of the cost optimization and productivity efforts and the gains they got this year. Can you step back and kind of remind us and perhaps, Jim, as well where we are at in kind of the broader march towards automation and productivity investments and some of the key KPIs that we should be thinking about in terms of progress for 2024?\nJohn J. Morris: Yes. Noah, good morning. It's a good question. Originally, we started talking about just in terms of the elimination of some labor dependency in the 5,000 to 7,000 job range. And it was across a handful of pretty broad areas. One, was the customer experience group. One, was through our routing, which would reduce our dependency on kind of frontline driver labor and obviously then recycling a little bit on SG&A. And what I would tell you is, you think about this way, we're about 75% through what we had planned for the customer experience side on the resi automation and this has as much truck deliveries, which did improve in 2023, we\u2019re about 40% of the way through there. On the recycling side, as Jim mentioned in his remarks, we've got a number of plants are going to be automated this year, kind of Jim, can comment more on that, we're about 20% of the way through there. So, I would tell you we're making great progress. I think it showed up obviously across the board in our margins and specifically in labor in Q4 and as the year progressed, but we still got plenty of opportunity out there. We feel like we're on a good pace.\nNoah Kaye: Very helpful. Just trying to think about cadence on EBITDA margins for the year. I know we have the typical seasonality and it sounds like the front half of the year, the growth is really a story of kind of the collection and disposal side. But Devina, are there any sort of guide post you can give us in terms of thinking about margin cadence, either for the first quarter or for the first half?\nDevina A. Rankin: Yes, I think it's a great question, Noah. And similar to what we talked about in terms of the EBITDA dollar growth, the cadence, sorry, for margin is pretty similar. We expect margin expansion to be more heavily weighted towards the front half of the year particularly in the collection and disposal business, the SG&A margin expansion will be fairly even over 2024. But then with regard to the sustainability businesses, the commodity price benefits that we expect to see in 2024 aren't quite significant, right. They're pretty muted on a year-over-year basis. But as a reminder, commodity price expansion in the recycling line of business can have some margin compression because of the really high return on invested capital part of our brokerage business. And, on the renewable natural gas part of the business, we expect margin expansion there too because those are such great margin projects, but those will be heavily weighted toward the back half. So, from a margin perspective, while the collection and disposal business is definitely the thing that delivered in Q4, we do expect that to be the thing that lifts margin most significantly in the year ahead and that will be weighted toward the first half of the year.\nNoah Kaye: Great. Kind of a lot of other questions to take offline, but I'll yield my time in consideration of others.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. You may proceed.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. Guidance seems to imply collection and disposal yields growth that you saw in 4Q 2023 will be essentially flat throughout \u201824 kind of around 5%. So, can you just help us kind of understand that, that pricing strength, it was a bit better than what we are forecasting, is it about better restricted pricing starting to flow through, would you attribute that to maybe mix, underlying strength in the market? Just anything you'd kind of call out, on that really sticky pricing that it looks like we're going to see in \u201824?\nJames C. Fish: Yes, Bryan, a couple of standouts really were continues to be residential pricing and disposal pricing, those actually showed increases year-over-year. Not surprisingly, the other collection lines of business were down, but that wasn't unexpected. As we move into \u201824, we think that kind of 4.5% to 5% yield number is a good target for us. And pricing continues to be a strength. We said at the beginning of \u201823 that our focus areas for the year would be pricing and then the cost controls that, John, went through. So, pricing is going to continue to at least add a little bit of margin for us. We think as opposed to \u201822 where we I've said several times we kind of felt like we were in hand-to-hand combat with our cost structure.\nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Thanks for that detail. Yes, last question for me and then I can turn it over. I know in 2023, there was a small decline in the event driven business that kind of prompted a guidance revision mid-year. I'm just wondering does \u201824 guidance assume that comes back? And then if there's anything else you'd like to flag on the event driven book that would be helpful? I'll turn it over. Thank you.\nDevina A. Rankin: Yes, it's a great question. And your recollection of our outlook revision mid-year is spot on with regard to some of the softness we were seeing in the special waste part of the business. And, we saw a strong recovery of that in the fourth quarter, which is one of the reasons that we saw revenue exceed our expectations late in the year. We're not necessarily expecting a rebound of special waste volumes in the year ahead, but we are expecting some of this momentum that we saw in Q4 to carry over, but nothing outsized. The one thing that I would call out as a reminder with regard to some of the special project type work is 2023 did have a benefit from Hurricane Ian volumes particularly in the first quarter, and so that certainly will have an impact on the Q1 comparisons in 2024.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nDevina A. Rankin: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: Devina, I wonder if you could just talk about margins, really outstanding performance by the team in the fourth quarter, if we were to just run the seasonally adjusted annual rate, that's about over 30% margin equivalent that you folks put up in the fourth quarter, the full-year guidance for \u201824 is about a point lower than that. It sounds like yield is still very much at a good place. So, I'm just trying to make sure that there are no items that you would view as one-off in the fourth quarter versus, hey, it's early in the year and we just want to make sure we have room to execute?\nDevina A. Rankin: I definitely think the way that you summarized it there on the last part of your comment is the way that we're thinking about this, in particular when we were setting our margin expectations for the year ahead, the momentum that we have in the fourth quarter shows that we have tremendous confidence in having the cost improvement work that we've been so focused on as an organization through automation technology, and importantly, the delivery of trucks as something that we can continue to see benefits from in the year ahead. The caution for us, I would say that may have us below that seasonally adjusted margin outlook that you've done. It really relates to a couple of things. It's one, some of the weather impacts that we saw in January. Two, last year when we gave inflation outlook, we tended to see that inflation was sticking around and being more stubborn than we had predicted and so we're taking a more cautious view on inflationary pressures in the year ahead than we did a year ago. But really what I want to highlight is that, there's tremendous confidence in the fundamentals. The price cost spread has improved. The accelerated truck deliveries and our optimization efforts and the discipline in SG&A are all showing strong results. I think the best line to look at is actually our repair and maintenance line and the operating expense as a percentage of revenue category. And, over the long-term that had trended below 9% of revenue for us and through the first nine months of 2023, we were at 9.9%. That measure was down to 9.1% in Q4. So, we know that we've got some really strong momentum coming into the year ahead that will continue those cost benefits that you saw us produce in the fourth quarter. Into 2024, we just think that it's prudent to be on the conservative side when predicting full-year margin.\nJames C. Fish: So, Jerry, real quickly, we did kind of anticipate that there will be some questions on margin. And so, just a couple of things here. First of all, the margin obviously for Q4 was as strong as we could have expected it and to be and that has continued as we look at the month of January. January came in quite strong for us, so we're pleased with that. The second point would be around some of the questions that you're asking around conservatism on margin for \u201824 and Devina did a really good job of explaining that. I think it's really just I guess you could argue that it's conservative based on 90 basis points of improvement from 2022 to 2023. But there seems to be an uncertain year in front of us every time we come to this point. We don't know exactly what the economy is going to do. Some days I feel great about the economy, other day is not so great. So, you could argue there's a little bit of economic conservatism in there and also a little bit of forecasting conservatism coming off such a strong year that you want to try and say we're going to do the same thing going forward into \u201824. But we do feel really good about the way we finished the year and honestly the way we've started the year so far through January.\nJerry Revich: Really appreciate the color. And Jim, can I ask you just on a separate topic, landfill gas transactions are coming in at really attractive levels? The Enbridge transaction was $2.70 per MMBtu. It's costing you folks $50 per MMBtu to bring your assets online. So, just given how apparently deep the market is for those type of assets, can you just update us on how are you thinking about what it would take for you to consider monetizing some of the landfill gas assets when you bring them online? Has the attractive market price impacted how you're thinking about the own versus sell opportunity?\nJames C. Fish: So, I'm going I'll say one word on that and then I'm going to turn it over to Tara Hemmer to maybe give a little bit more color. But, that's always an option for us. And we have multiple options and it's good to be in a place where you have multiple options. But at this point, we're pleased with the progress we're making on building these plants. We have a number of plants that are at various stages of construction. Tara, anything to add to that?\nTara J. Hemmer: I would just say this aligns really well with our business and we're making great progress on building out these plans. The five that we're going to bring online in 2024, we're going to have strong contribution from them exiting 2024 and this is going to be something we're going to continue to grow.\nJerry Revich: Appreciate the discussion. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tyler Brown with Raymond James. You may proceed.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning.\nDevina A. Rankin: Good morning.\nTyler Brown: Hey, Tara, actually, I want to come back to the updated sustainability CapEx figures of $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion. So, I may have missed it, but if I'm not mistaken that number was closer to $2.2 billion back at the Analyst Day. Now, I get that there are $350 million in incremental recycling opportunities, but what makes up the difference, call it that $300 million. Was that just inflation?\nTara J. Hemmer: Yes, the difference really is related to inflation, primarily in our renewable natural gas build and relates to inflation related supply chain, also a little bit on construction increases and interconnects. So, that is the difference.\nTyler Brown: Okay, perfect. That's helpful. That's very helpful. And then, Devina, thank you so much for the WM renewables segment reporting. But, I do just want to make sure that I understand it all. So, I get the impact in revenues from the change in the price of the commodities that are impacting that WM renewables and recycling line, but if you look at the change in that line versus the change in the net revenue for those, they don't exactly line up. So, it tells me that there's likely some volume component in there. So just to be clear, maybe this would be helpful, but when you bring on a facility like Eco Vista, where does that show up? Does that show up as basically volume in your IRG calc, or can you just help us with how the accounting will work?\nDevina A. Rankin: Sure. And Ed and Heather will be happy to walk you through any details I don't cover here. But, I'm glad, one, that the additional clarity is beneficial. The other that I would say is that on the IRG measures that we do, the internal revenue growth measures that we do, you'll see commodity price impact in a single line, which is recycling processes and renewable energy, so that's all price. And then you'll see the incremental volume from new projects, whether it be automation projects that have more throughput at the plant or the new Eco Vista plant that will be in the volume line. In terms of the segment reporting line, the only thing that might be a little bit of a complicating factor is the internal revenue between the renewables business and the collection and disposal business, you can think of it as the renewables business paying a royalty to the collection and disposal business associated with the landfill gas production that doesn't show up in the revenue line, because it's effectively just a cost for the renewables business. Hopefully that's helpful.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Yes, I definitely think so. We'll parse it out. But I think you mentioned the collection and disposal volume could be up maybe 1%. But again kind of going back to that total IRG table, could we actually see that number closer to 2%? Because I would assume that with $115 million of incremental renewables EBITDA, there's probably at least a couple of $100 million of revenue associated with that, does that make sense?\nDevina A. Rankin: So, the way to think about this is that when we gave that volume outlook that was just the collection and disposal volume. The renewable energy business increases. We have on a combined basis being in the range of 30 basis points to 60 basis points in the year ahead. And, that's a combination of commodity price impacts and volume.\nTyler Brown: Excellent. Okay. Last one here, Devina. So, margins were super strong. We've talked about that. I think they're up 230 basis points year-over-year in Q4. But can you kind of help us bridge that 230? I think there was a fewer day, maybe fuel was a help, maybe commodities help, just any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.\nDevina A. Rankin: Yes, for Q4 specifically, again, the collection and disposal business and the efficiency that we drove was the lion's share of that improvement at 220 basis points. Fuel was another 50 basis points. So, that really does explain almost the entirety of it. There are a few other puts and takes, but I would say that my comments earlier about repair and maintenance and then John's comments about the labor line, those are the two places that are driving that 220 basis points of margin expansion.\nJames C. Fish: I think Tyler, a little bit of an add on here is that I've been told we don't pat ourselves on the back enough, so I'm going to pat ourselves on the back a little bit here. When we started talking about some aspirational metrics, meaning margin, EBITDA margin, SG&A as percent of revenue, OpEx as percent a couple of years ago and then talking about technology and using attrition to reduce our labor dependence. Those numbers were pretty far out on the horizon. And, now in every case those numbers are literally a stone's throw away for us. Whether you talk about 30% EBITDA margin, we're right there for the fourth quarter, SG&A at 9%, we're very close to that and OpEx at 60%, very close to that. So, I'm really proud of the team for executing so well on this and being able to stand up on this call today and last quarter as well and say those things that we put out there, those goals that we set, we're getting close to achieving those. That means we're satisfied. We'll continue to set higher goals, but I'm pleased with the fact that we've been able to get to those goals that were pretty far in the out on the horizon we initially set them.\nTyler Brown: Yes. No, love it. Appreciate it so much. Thank you for the time.\nJames C. Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Michael Hoffman with Stifel. You may proceed.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey, gang. Thanks for the questions. Back to the margin question, John, it seems like looking at this on a two-year stack helps because you can't perfectly time when you get some of your self-help. And that sort of accounts for really strong \u201823, a little more muted \u201824, but the two-year stack is sort of 60 basis points a year. So, where the question underlying that is, recycling is an incremental tailwind because you've got a pretty low estimate there relative to how you finished the year on the basket. GDP, I'm assuming you think it's maybe 1%, 1.5% and the trend is stronger than that. So, that's a tailwind. And then I think your wage growth is probably running closer to 3.5%, 4%, therefore, there's clear spread on price cost. Am I looking at that correctly?\nJohn J. Morris: I'll start, Devina. I think on the cost spread comment to you, Michael, I think that's what we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters whether you look at core price or our yield numbers. We've been talking about being disciplined in the way we approach pricing and over time in the last couple of quarters, we've been a great example that we've been able to really drive out, drive some operating efficiencies and drive out some of the labor dependency and Devina commented on the maintenance repair. That's another bucket where we've made a lot of progress. I think in Q4 we were flat to slightly down year-over-year in terms of whole dollars. So, that's part of what was helping us in Q4.\nDevina A. Rankin: And then I'll just add a little bit of color that provide some clarity on a couple of the points that you brought up, Michael. One, with higher recycling commodity prices, the brokerage business can actually put downward pressure on margin. And so that's one of the things that we have built into our outlook for 2024. And then, in terms of wage inflation, we start at 4% with our folks. And so, wage inflation is still expected to be north of 4% when you take into account spot increases that we have to provide in certain markets to be responsive to various changes. So, 4% is kind of our baseline, and then you add on top of that.\nMichael Hoffman: And your GDP assumption is pretty muted?\nDevina A. Rankin: Yes. Basically, what we've always said is that we believe that our volume is about a 75% flow through from GDP. And so, we did have a fairly muted outlook with regard to GDP when we built our plan. I hope your crystal ball is better than mine, but I would tell you that our expectations for economic outlook continue to be that we need to be on the cautious side of things just because there's so much left in uncertainty, you saw that with today's print on CPI as an example, which exceeded expectations.\nMichael Hoffman: Yes, I get that. It's just the consumer seems to keep plowing ahead. Switching gears a little bit, Tara, if your renewable natural gas or landfill gas is kind of a Swiss army knife of renewable fuel, when do the federal agencies wake up to this and say we get a proper interpretation of the ITC or the 45Q or Z credits or come back to e-RINs. What's your view of where that goes? And then the second piece is, what are you assuming happens out in the out years in that $1.5 billion of RNG spend, how much do you get back for credits?\nTara J. Hemmer: So, starting with the real positive, the one thing that the federal government did is, said a three-year RVO and having that for 2023 through 2025, you've seen clear stability in the program and so that's been a positive. With the ITC, we think when Treasury issued their guidance that there was a misinterpretation over what was in the Inflation Reduction Act and we don't just share this view, others do with us that are in the biogas community and generate landfill gas renewable energy from landfill gas. We've commented on that and we're anticipating that Treasury will come out with some further guidance later this year and so cautiously optimistic there. So, there's a whole host of credits that could be stacked. Obviously, the ITC was within our plan and we remain optimistic related to that and of course looking to 2025 with the production tax credit too.\nDevina A. Rankin: On the ITC point, Michael, just so that we're crystal clear in terms of the implications of that on our 2024 guidance. We contemplated $120 million of ITC benefit in our free cash flow outlook for the year.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then some housekeeping if we could. I love the segment reporting as well. Are we going to get any kind of tons-in, tons-out so we can actually do a bottoms up forecast on sales for the renewable and processing segment, and then how about megawatts and MMBtus to be able to do the same thing on a sales growth for renewables?\nDevina A. Rankin: So, we want to take a breath and celebrate, all of the incremental transparency we've provided. We're really proud of the work that the team did because, while it looks easy, it isn't. There's a whole lot of work that went into it. With regard to the more, I would say, operational driver elements of the reporting, we'll continue to evaluate whether or not there's anything that it's a strong complement to the financial measures and consider any additions in the years ahead. But right now, we're going to continue to execute on this strong reporting that we've been able to accomplish. And, we actually would like to see the industry follow suit in terms of providing additional visibility because we think it's beneficial.\nMichael Hoffman: So in the K, one, when will it be recent? Two, will we get quarterly data for all of \u201822 and all of \u201823 and then three years of forecast so we can we build our models in this format?\nDevina A. Rankin: So, the K will be released early today and we're in good shape for that. So, thank you to the team. With regard to the quarterly data, you'll get that over the course of the year. It'll have the full-year data. The quarterly recast will come quarter-by-quarter.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. You may proceed.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you.\nDevina A. Rankin: Good morning.\nStephanie Moore: So, just kind of just looking at the 2024 guidance assumption, it looks like you're assuming RINs at about $3 which makes sense given where RINs are today, but digging into a little bit more, can you maybe talk about in terms of what contracts that you have already signed and kind of where you're able to lock in those prices going into the year? I think you said a sustainability day that you were looking to have 70% to 90% locked in any given 12-month period. So, any update on where that stands for 2024 to get to that $3 RIN? Thank you.\nTara J. Hemmer: Sure. So we have about two-thirds of our off-take locked in for 2024. And when we think about what's locked in, it is a mix of long-term contracts and also RINs that we purchased really sold on the forward side into 2024 which would have been at a higher rate than $3. So, on a blended basis, you sort of get a lower average there. And then the third that we would be selling in 2024 that's what's at the $3 RIN guide. The other thing I want to just mention is those longer term contracts that we have in place, there is a mix anywhere from five to 20 years, so we're really trying to take an approach where we have different tenors that we're locked in at.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. No, that's very helpful. And then maybe sticking on the sustainability front, you talked about some incremental investments included in your updated outlook and you noticed that that involves two projects in Canada. Can you talk a little bit about the opportunity? I'm assuming that those are probably related to EPR changes in Canada. If that is the correct assumption, maybe just what how EPR might change the margin or growth opportunity compared to maybe your more traditional U.S. recycling business, so how are you thinking about those incremental opportunities? Thanks.\nTara J. Hemmer: The two Canadian projects are related to extended producer responsibility and I think this is a great example where we were able to really showcase our automation investments and how differentiated our assets are really taking the pro to some of the facilities that we have across the United States. And so, that's a great example where we're able to win more business based on those investments. Extended producer responsibility in Canada and the structure that we have there, it really is around us using those assets as manufacturing plants and really it's a fee for service model. So, it's a great example of how we can leverage this technology differentiation for more business in the future.\nStephanie Moore: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from John Mazzoni with Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nJohn Mazzoni: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick one in terms of the sustainability EBITDA timing. Is this just really kind of a knock on impact of some of the 2023 project delays, I think we noticed change to run rate versus kind of in \u201826, any color would be appreciated? Thank you.\nDevina A. Rankin: So there's two key things that I would want everyone to bear in mind as you think about our trajectory. The first is in 2024, we're going to have roughly 40 projects under construction at any given time. So, that really gives you a sense of how we're building and we have a lot of momentum in the ramp. The second key piece is really exiting 2024, we're going to be approaching roughly $300 million in run rate EBITDA which gives you a sense of where we're headed on that ramp to the $800 million. So, what we're really seeing in 2024 is a true build of momentum on reaching that $800 million target.\nJames C. Fish: And John, those supply chain constraints are not that different from what we've seen on the fleet side of our business either. The good news is that as you heard, John Morris, talk about it, we started to see that free up a bit and so Tara seeing the same thing on the RNG and recycling side, but we definitely had some supply chain constraints that contributed to this bit of a slowdown over 2022 in particular, but also the front half of 2023.\nJohn Mazzoni: Great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. You may proceed.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. Wanted to get your sense for acquisition expectations. So, how are the favorable trends in your business, which is a pretty long list of price, cost, yield, new investment production, etcetera, different than those at the smaller players with whom you have a dialogue for acquisitions.\nJames C. Fish: So, look, we said that our acquisition pipeline was robust. I think what you're seeing is that some of those, and I'm speaking just from this is somewhat anecdotal and speaking to some of those folks that we have acquired, is that, there's kind of a multitude of challenges for them, some of which we face and some of which we don't face. So, one that we might not face is a lack of a succession plan for some of these folks. Their kids have just decided they don't want to run the business. They'd rather go take the money and live in Italy. And so, that's not something we face fortunately, but they're also having challenges with labor. We're addressing that as you've heard today through automation and in some cases they are as well, in some cases they're not able to do that. So, there's a number of different reasons why there's a growing list of willing sellers. We're going to take advantage of that. But at the same time, we've invested heavily in these organic growth projects, and we want to make sure that we have similar returns before we go invest heavily in tuck-ins.\nTobey Sommer: Good to hear. I'm glad you're not going to go chase the [trust and sun] (ph). So, appreciate that. With respect to the fleet, after a full allotment last year, where are you in terms of being able to just renew the fleet at what might be considered a normal cadence? Do you still have some catch up to do?\nJames C. Fish: Yes. Tobey, we got about, we've delivered about 1,700 units this year, which was a little light of what we had planned for, but that would be really considered a full lot. And we probably have another 300 units on top of that to deliver. So, I would say that by the end of \u201824, we're fully caught up. What I would tell you is, team has done a really good job of not compromising the quality of our fleet had shown up in our service and it's really starting to show up in the back half of the year in terms of our operating performance and we see that continuing into \u201824, and certainly as we get the benefit of some additional vehicles.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Kevin Chiang with CIBC. You may proceed.\nKevin Chiang: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a clarification on the updated sustainability investments and EBITDA profile as we look up to 2026, I think if I, if memory serves me correct, when you had the Sustainability Investor Day, I think you had about a 90% free cash flow conversion in 2026 from EBITDA into free cash flow. Is that still the rule of thumb we should be thinking about on the $800 million of EBITDA in 2026 in terms of the free cash flow potential from these investments?\nDevina A. Rankin: We can specifically confirm that number for you. We didn't refresh that.\nKevin Chiang: Okay.\nDevina A. Rankin: But the key takeaway for us there, whether it's 70% or 90%, and that's kind of the zip code that I think we should be thinking about. The free cash flow conversion in these businesses is stronger because, the maintenance capital is lower. And so, it is right to think about that being a really strong fundamental contributing factor to the long-term yield of this business.\nKevin Chiang: That makes a ton of sense. And just on the, I guess on the two facilities in Canada related to EPR, are these in Ontario? And just as you think of, I guess, EPR throughout the country as multiple provinces look to implement this, just what that pipeline of opportunity looks like from an EPR perspective and investing in more cycling facilities, I guess, coast-to-coast in Canada?\nTara J. Hemmer: You're exactly right. Those two are in Ontario and this is something that we're actively tracking throughout Canada and then of course looking at where there is pending legislation in the United States as well. There's obviously Colorado as an example, which is on the front and making sure that we're well-positioned to respond to the PROs when they eventually implement.\nKevin Chiang: Excellent. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from James Schumm with TD Cowen. You may proceed.\nJames Schumm: Hey, good morning. Can you help me understand the monetization of the D-3 RINs credits? Is there a meaningful difference in price if you internalize or use the RNG in your own fleet versus selling it as a transportation fuel to someone else? And I know you'll reduce your fuel cost and emissions if you internalize the RNG, but just curious if there's a monetization benefit as well?\nTara J. Hemmer: The way to think about it and what is really unique about WM, is because we have our own fleet of compressed natural gas vehicles. We're in a very unique spot where we are able to close the loop. We produce renewable natural gas. We can allocate that renewable natural gas to our fleet to generate the RIN, so we don't have to give up any of our RIN value. That's probably the most significant advantage with WM as compared to others in the space. And that's how we monetize and create RINs ourselves versus others having to really tie it to someone else's fleet.\nJames Schumm: So Tara, just to clarify that, so when we see the D-3 RINs prices, I mean, I think some people have talked about, well, the actual monetization is a little bit lower than the price that I maybe see on the screen. Is that the case for you guys as well or no?\nTara J. Hemmer: No. I think --\nJames Schumm: Do you get that full value?\nTara J. Hemmer: I think we get the full value and the other thing to bear in mind is, you're looking at spot prices. And while we do play in the spot market, we also have been very actively looking at how we can forward sell and really look at selling our RINs six months out, a year out. So, there's a balance there.\nJames Schumm: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just lastly for me, I know that hazardous waste is a relatively small business for you, but I think you guys have a substantial market share of the hazardous landfills. The industry seems to be more profitable now and I was just hoping maybe you could help us quantify your business here and what's the outlook?\nJames C. Fish: Yes. I mean, we've been in hazardous waste space for quite some time and it continues to be a valuable component of our portfolio. And we've got coverage nationally. We've got assets on the East Coast and then obviously to the South East and on the West Coast as well. And, I would tell you, we continue to look for opportunities to grow that business. I think one of the benefits we have is, we've got a tremendous network of transportation assets that allows us to access a lot of the prominent markets, I think the Southeast, the Gulf Coast is one where we are very, very well-positioned, in terms of our hazardous waste presence.\nJames Schumm: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. So, I guess I'll start just on the price cost spread that you kind of alluded to in your opening remarks. You indicated that it improved and certainly that spread when costs were rising dramatically in 2022, it kind of contracted and then as costs moderated somewhat and your pricing held in, presumably it's been widening here in 2023 or back in 2023. My question for you is what your view is on the go-forward of that spread, is that something that you believe you can maintain at a higher level than it's been historically? Or is 2023 just bringing it back to where it was historically and that's likely where it's going to be going forward?\nJames C. Fish: Well, I think you've hit on the right focal point for us which is that price cost spread as opposed to just looking at price because obviously, in \u201822, price was higher. But as I said, we were really just combating this real high inflation in \u201822. \u201823 was as you said back to a point where the price cost spread starts to widen a bit. And so how much that widens is a little bit of a question mark. We don't know exactly where inflation goes. This morning's numbers were maybe a little disappointing to the market. But we feel good about the wage inflation. We feel like that is much more kind of something we have control of now, whereas two years ago, we really had less control over it. I think you'll see the price cost spread stay pretty close to where it's been in 2023. 2024 won't be a big change from that standpoint.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay, perfect. And when, I know with your sustainability initiatives, it does introduce a little bit of commodity price variability in there. When you look at the midpoint of your EBITDA guidance for \u201824 and you look at the growth in the dollar value of that, about a quarter of that I think is from sustainability initiatives of that growth. And some of those as you mentioned are back-end weighted. Can you talk to us from a risk standpoint as it relates to two, first, when an investor asks you what about the volatility that commodity prices brings in? Can you remind us about, how you lock in price and give us some assurances there? And then the second part of the risk profile, how much of it is related to permitting or completion of construction projects that might get delayed through the course of the year, how do you feel about that risk component to its contribution in 2024?\nTara J. Hemmer: I can go ahead and take it in two parts and I'll speak to the commodity price piece first and then the timeline second. So, on the commodity price piece for recycling, I think one of the things that we've done really well is really change our model to be a fee-for-service model and we have 95% of our contracts through that, which is really insulated us a bit on the commodity side. And then on top of that, recall that a significant piece of the benefit is coming independent of commodity prices, really those labor cost improvements and also some price premiums that we get related to the automation benefit. On the renewable energy side, one of the things that we've been clear on is that we're going to work towards an 80-40-20 framework where 80% of our volume would be locked up within one year, and that would be something that we would be working towards in 2026. You heard me mention roughly a third of our off-take is already locked up. So, that gives us some confidence on the commodity price side. Related to projects, we've really been kicking this around, looking at our project timelines and making sure that we're within a strong and confident range for 2024. We have two large projects that are coming online in Q3 and so feel confident in our ability to hit the project timelines on both the recycling and renewable energy side.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay, that's great. Really appreciate that color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for questions. Our next question comes from Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.\nHilary Lee: Hi, this is Hilary Lee on for Toni Kaplan. Just wanted to ask on the sustainability EBITDA part, so if I recall correctly during the Sustainability Analyst Day, we were expecting around $600 million from RNG including the third-party e-RINs by 2026. So just wondering what is kind of that delta between the now [$510 million] (ph) versus the $600 million?\nTara J. Hemmer: I think you have to compare the $510 million to the $500 million, because the $500 million number was without the e-RINs and the third-party RNG projects. So, the best way to think about it is we've increased our target by $10 million for the renewable natural gas business.\nHilary Lee: Got it. Appreciate it. And just on for the recycling, the increase in the is that for essentially the two new projects in Canada?\nTara J. Hemmer: A portion of it is from the two new projects in Canada and then a mix of other benefits from our portfolio projects.\nHilary Lee: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish for any closing remarks.\nJames C. Fish: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us. We're very proud of the quarter we had, very proud of the year, excited about what 2024 holds for us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "John J. Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. We're more than pleased with the strong operational performance our team achieved in 2023 showing continuous improvement throughout the year with standout results in the fourth quarter. During this period, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 240 basis points year-over-year landing at 60.3% and marking our second best quarterly performance ever. This improvement was primarily fueled by our collection and disposal business benefiting from the robust operating leverage of our strategic cost optimization. Our proactive measures to accelerate and improve cost efficiency included leveraging technology to manage labor, managing repair and maintenance costs and optimizing our overall cost structure. These initiatives led to a substantial improvement in WM's cost to serve metrics, bringing estimated unit cost inflation to low-single-digits by the fourth quarter. When combined with solid results from our pricing initiatives, we greatly enhanced overall margins. Our strong second half performance translated into full-year operating expenses as a percentage of revenue of 61.7%, an improvement of 70 basis points. That momentum has carried into 2024 and is evident in our January results even as we face severe weather in some areas we serve. Two of the key cost categories driving our operating improvements are labor and repair and maintenance. On the labor front, this begins with our persistent focus on reducing turnover. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a noteworthy milestone as driver turnover reaches lowest point at 18.4%, showing improvement as the year progressed. Additionally, our strategic automation initiatives are yielding positive results in collection efficiency with all three lines of business improving meaningfully in the fourth quarter compared to last year. The results of our technology and automation investments gained traction in the latter part of 2023, leading to significant strides in labor cost management. We expect this to continue into 2024 as we broaden the deployment of our tools across additional sites. Turning to repair and maintenance, with a full lot of trucks received in 2023, we successfully removed over a 1,000 excess assets from our operation, improve the age of our routed fleet and reduce truck rental utilization by nearly 60% since the beginning of 2023. Throughout 2023, our emphasis remained on streamlining maintenance processes, which has resulted in enhanced technician productivity, reduced overtime expenses and diminished reliance on external repair services. This is paid off in the form of lower repair and maintenance costs in both dollars and as a percentage of revenue compared to 2022. We accomplished all this with an unwavering commitment to safety and by enhancing the quality of our fleet. We're proud of the strides we made throughout 2023 and look forward to sustained progress. Another core element of the equation that fueled our strong financial results is disciplined organic revenue growth. Growth from price and volume in the collection and disposal business totaled 6.3% for the year, which outpaced our expectations. Our pricing programs continue to be focused on striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. Our full-year churn rates remain at the lower-end of historical range at about 9% and the year-over-year improvement underscores our consistent delivery of quality service to our customers. Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate sustained momentum in our disciplined pricing programs to result in core price between 6% and 6.5% and yield approaching 5%. We remain committed to maximizing customer lifetime value up while securing pricing that exceeds our cost inflation. We've seen that spread improve as 2023 progressed and we are confident that our teams are poised to deliver another successful year ahead. Turning to volumes, our fourth quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 1.9% on a workday adjusted basis. Growth was primarily driven by MSW landfill and commercial collection, two bellwethers for demand of our services. Overall growth in landfill volumes was somewhat muted due to the elevated volumes from the Hurricane Ian clean up in 2022. Some of the recent quarters, residential collection volumes declined modestly due to our intentional shedding of low margin contracts as we work to ensure that we achieved acceptable returns for all parts of our business. You can see the benefits of this focus because while our residential collection volumes declined, total revenue and earnings in this line of business both improved. This is a winning equation and we'll continue to execute on the strategy in the year ahead. Organic revenue growth in all collection lines of business remains as positive and operating EBITDA continues to grow. In the fourth quarter, new business grew and net services increases remain firmly positive reflecting our quality of service and focused differentiation. Looking ahead to 2024, our guidance anticipates collection and disposal volume approaching 1%, mirroring the performance achieved in 2023. And finally, I want to convey my appreciation to our frontline teams for their unwavering commitment to delivering safe and reliable service to our customers and communities on a daily basis. It's their efforts that made 2023 successful and laid the groundwork for growth in the years ahead. I will now turn the call over to Devina, to discuss our 2023 financial results and 2024 financial outlook in greater detail. Yes. Noah, good morning. It's a good question. Originally, we started talking about just in terms of the elimination of some labor dependency in the 5,000 to 7,000 job range. And it was across a handful of pretty broad areas. One, was the customer experience group. One, was through our routing, which would reduce our dependency on kind of frontline driver labor and obviously then recycling a little bit on SG&A. And what I would tell you is, you think about this way, we're about 75% through what we had planned for the customer experience side on the resi automation and this has as much truck deliveries, which did improve in 2023, we're about 40% of the way through there. On the recycling side, as Jim mentioned in his remarks, we've got a number of plants are going to be automated this year, kind of Jim, can comment more on that, we're about 20% of the way through there. So, I would tell you we're making great progress. I think it showed up obviously across the board in our margins and specifically in labor in Q4 and as the year progressed, but we still got plenty of opportunity out there. We feel like we're on a good pace. I'll start, Devina. I think on the cost spread comment to you, Michael, I think that's what we've been talking about for the last couple of quarters whether you look at core price or our yield numbers. We've been talking about being disciplined in the way we approach pricing and over time in the last couple of quarters, we've been a great example that we've been able to really drive out, drive some operating efficiencies and drive out some of the labor dependency and Devina commented on the maintenance repair. That's another bucket where we've made a lot of progress. I think in Q4 we were flat to slightly down year-over-year in terms of whole dollars. So, that's part of what was helping us in Q4."

            "content": "All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered a remarkably strong finish to 2023 driving fourth operating EBITDA 15% higher. This accelerated earnings growth led to full-year operating EBITDA that exceeded the high-end of our most recent guidance range by nearly $25 million and achieved the midpoint of our original expectations from the beginning of the year. Our strong financial results for both the quarter and the year were powered by our collection and disposal business. This performance starts with disciplined organic revenue growth that exceeded our expectations. And once again, our success in managing the middle of the P&L really stands out in our results, as our teams continue to make progress in optimizing our cost structure with the help of technology and automation. When you combine our revenue performance with the improvement in operating costs, we saw widening of our price-to-cost spread and increased profitability. Operating EBITDA margin reached a record 29.9% in the fourth quarter and full-year margin expanded 90 basis points 28.9%. As 2024 kicks-off, we're confident that our continued focus on optimizing our cost structure and executing on sustainability growth projects sets us up for another year of outsized growth. We anticipate operating EBITDA growth of 7.7% at the midpoint of our guidance, which translates to more than $450 million of which $115 million comes directly from our sustainability growth investments. We remain excited about the economic and environmental benefits of expanding our renewable natural gas and recycling platforms. Our execution is tracking well and we expect to commission five new renewable natural gas facilities by the end of the year reaching 30% of our run rate renewable natural gas volume growth. We're also on-track to complete automation upgrades at 10 recycling facilities and add three recycling facilities in new markets in 2024. Turning to capital allocation, you'll hear from Devina, on this topic in more detail, but I want to stress our confidence and our ability to continue to allocate capital to all of our priorities. This includes investing in our high-return sustainability growth projects, acquiring accretive businesses and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Our tuck-in acquisition pipeline is robust, and there are some indications that 2024 could have heightened activity in this regard. We're committed to a disciplined approach to acquiring companies ensuring that any deals we pursue yield appropriate returns particularly given the high-returns in sustainability opportunities. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for another great year. We were just at the WM Phoenix Open last week and I've said before, we work hard for this event to create a representation of the bigger company with a central focus on people and the environment. We've been the title sponsor for 15 years now and the tournament's been recognized as the largest zero waste sporting event in the world for 12 years running. It makes me proud to see the WM team out there making waste diversion operations run smoothly and demonstrating our sustainability leadership so well. I look forward to working with this great team in 2024 as we continue to drive growth by executing our operating plans and progressing our investments in technology, automation and sustainability. I'll now turn the call over to John, to discuss our operational results. Yes, Bryan, a couple of standouts really were continues to be residential pricing and disposal pricing, those actually showed increases year-over-year. Not surprisingly, the other collection lines of business were down, but that wasn't unexpected. As we move into \u201824, we think that kind of 4.5% to 5% yield number is a good target for us. And pricing continues to be a strength. We said at the beginning of \u201823 that our focus areas for the year would be pricing and then the cost controls that, John, went through. So, pricing is going to continue to at least add a little bit of margin for us. We think as opposed to \u201822 where we I've said several times we kind of felt like we were in hand-to-hand combat with our cost structure. So, Jerry, real quickly, we did kind of anticipate that there will be some questions on margin. And so, just a couple of things here. First of all, the margin obviously for Q4 was as strong as we could have expected it and to be and that has continued as we look at the month of January. January came in quite strong for us, so we're pleased with that. The second point would be around some of the questions that you're asking around conservatism on margin for \u201824 and Devina did a really good job of explaining that. I think it's really just I guess you could argue that it's conservative based on 90 basis points of improvement from 2022 to 2023. But there seems to be an uncertain year in front of us every time we come to this point. We don't know exactly what the economy is going to do. Some days I feel great about the economy, other day is not so great. So, you could argue there's a little bit of economic conservatism in there and also a little bit of forecasting conservatism coming off such a strong year that you want to try and say we're going to do the same thing going forward into \u201824. But we do feel really good about the way we finished the year and honestly the way we've started the year so far through January. So, I'm going I'll say one word on that and then I'm going to turn it over to Tara Hemmer to maybe give a little bit more color. But, that's always an option for us. And we have multiple options and it's good to be in a place where you have multiple options. But at this point, we're pleased with the progress we're making on building these plants. We have a number of plants that are at various stages of construction. Tara, anything to add to that? I think Tyler, a little bit of an add on here is that I've been told we don't pat ourselves on the back enough, so I'm going to pat ourselves on the back a little bit here. When we started talking about some aspirational metrics, meaning margin, EBITDA margin, SG&A as percent of revenue, OpEx as percent a couple of years ago and then talking about technology and using attrition to reduce our labor dependence. Those numbers were pretty far out on the horizon. And, now in every case those numbers are literally a stone's throw away for us. Whether you talk about 30% EBITDA margin, we're right there for the fourth quarter, SG&A at 9%, we're very close to that and OpEx at 60%, very close to that. So, I'm really proud of the team for executing so well on this and being able to stand up on this call today and last quarter as well and say those things that we put out there, those goals that we set, we're getting close to achieving those. That means we're satisfied. We'll continue to set higher goals, but I'm pleased with the fact that we've been able to get to those goals that were pretty far in the out on the horizon we initially set them. You bet. And John, those supply chain constraints are not that different from what we've seen on the fleet side of our business either. The good news is that as you heard, John Morris, talk about it, we started to see that free up a bit and so Tara seeing the same thing on the RNG and recycling side, but we definitely had some supply chain constraints that contributed to this bit of a slowdown over 2022 in particular, but also the front half of 2023. So, look, we said that our acquisition pipeline was robust. I think what you're seeing is that some of those, and I'm speaking just from this is somewhat anecdotal and speaking to some of those folks that we have acquired, is that, there's kind of a multitude of challenges for them, some of which we face and some of which we don't face. So, one that we might not face is a lack of a succession plan for some of these folks. Their kids have just decided they don't want to run the business. They'd rather go take the money and live in Italy. And so, that's not something we face fortunately, but they're also having challenges with labor. We're addressing that as you've heard today through automation and in some cases they are as well, in some cases they're not able to do that. So, there's a number of different reasons why there's a growing list of willing sellers. We're going to take advantage of that. But at the same time, we've invested heavily in these organic growth projects, and we want to make sure that we have similar returns before we go invest heavily in tuck-ins. Yes. Tobey, we got about, we've delivered about 1,700 units this year, which was a little light of what we had planned for, but that would be really considered a full lot. And we probably have another 300 units on top of that to deliver. So, I would say that by the end of \u201824, we're fully caught up. What I would tell you is, team has done a really good job of not compromising the quality of our fleet had shown up in our service and it's really starting to show up in the back half of the year in terms of our operating performance and we see that continuing into \u201824, and certainly as we get the benefit of some additional vehicles. Yes. I mean, we've been in hazardous waste space for quite some time and it continues to be a valuable component of our portfolio. And we've got coverage nationally. We've got assets on the East Coast and then obviously to the South East and on the West Coast as well. And, I would tell you, we continue to look for opportunities to grow that business. I think one of the benefits we have is, we've got a tremendous network of transportation assets that allows us to access a lot of the prominent markets, I think the Southeast, the Gulf Coast is one where we are very, very well-positioned, in terms of our hazardous waste presence. Well, I think you've hit on the right focal point for us which is that price cost spread as opposed to just looking at price because obviously, in \u201822, price was higher. But as I said, we were really just combating this real high inflation in \u201822. \u201823 was as you said back to a point where the price cost spread starts to widen a bit. And so how much that widens is a little bit of a question mark. We don't know exactly where inflation goes. This morning's numbers were maybe a little disappointing to the market. But we feel good about the wage inflation. We feel like that is much more kind of something we have control of now, whereas two years ago, we really had less control over it. I think you'll see the price cost spread stay pretty close to where it's been in 2023. 2024 won't be a big change from that standpoint. Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us. We're very proud of the quarter we had, very proud of the year, excited about what 2024 holds for us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much."

            "name": "Tara J. Hemmer",
            "content": "I would just say this aligns really well with our business and we're making great progress on building out these plans. The five that we're going to bring online in 2024, we're going to have strong contribution from them exiting 2024 and this is going to be something we're going to continue to grow. Yes, the difference really is related to inflation, primarily in our renewable natural gas build and relates to inflation related supply chain, also a little bit on construction increases and interconnects. So, that is the difference. So, starting with the real positive, the one thing that the federal government did is, said a three-year RVO and having that for 2023 through 2025, you've seen clear stability in the program and so that's been a positive. With the ITC, we think when Treasury issued their guidance that there was a misinterpretation over what was in the Inflation Reduction Act and we don't just share this view, others do with us that are in the biogas community and generate landfill gas renewable energy from landfill gas. We've commented on that and we're anticipating that Treasury will come out with some further guidance later this year and so cautiously optimistic there. So, there's a whole host of credits that could be stacked. Obviously, the ITC was within our plan and we remain optimistic related to that and of course looking to 2025 with the production tax credit too. Sure. So we have about two-thirds of our off-take locked in for 2024. And when we think about what's locked in, it is a mix of long-term contracts and also RINs that we purchased really sold on the forward side into 2024 which would have been at a higher rate than $3. So, on a blended basis, you sort of get a lower average there. And then the third that we would be selling in 2024 that's what's at the $3 RIN guide. The other thing I want to just mention is those longer term contracts that we have in place, there is a mix anywhere from five to 20 years, so we're really trying to take an approach where we have different tenors that we're locked in at. The two Canadian projects are related to extended producer responsibility and I think this is a great example where we were able to really showcase our automation investments and how differentiated our assets are really taking the pro to some of the facilities that we have across the United States. And so, that's a great example where we're able to win more business based on those investments. Extended producer responsibility in Canada and the structure that we have there, it really is around us using those assets as manufacturing plants and really it's a fee for service model. So, it's a great example of how we can leverage this technology differentiation for more business in the future. You're exactly right. Those two are in Ontario and this is something that we're actively tracking throughout Canada and then of course looking at where there is pending legislation in the United States as well. There's obviously Colorado as an example, which is on the front and making sure that we're well-positioned to respond to the PROs when they eventually implement. The way to think about it and what is really unique about WM, is because we have our own fleet of compressed natural gas vehicles. We're in a very unique spot where we are able to close the loop. We produce renewable natural gas. We can allocate that renewable natural gas to our fleet to generate the RIN, so we don't have to give up any of our RIN value. That's probably the most significant advantage with WM as compared to others in the space. And that's how we monetize and create RINs ourselves versus others having to really tie it to someone else's fleet. No. I think -- I think we get the full value and the other thing to bear in mind is, you're looking at spot prices. And while we do play in the spot market, we also have been very actively looking at how we can forward sell and really look at selling our RINs six months out, a year out. So, there's a balance there. I can go ahead and take it in two parts and I'll speak to the commodity price piece first and then the timeline second. So, on the commodity price piece for recycling, I think one of the things that we've done really well is really change our model to be a fee-for-service model and we have 95% of our contracts through that, which is really insulated us a bit on the commodity side. And then on top of that, recall that a significant piece of the benefit is coming independent of commodity prices, really those labor cost improvements and also some price premiums that we get related to the automation benefit. On the renewable energy side, one of the things that we've been clear on is that we're going to work towards an 80-40-20 framework where 80% of our volume would be locked up within one year, and that would be something that we would be working towards in 2026. You heard me mention roughly a third of our off-take is already locked up. So, that gives us some confidence on the commodity price side. Related to projects, we've really been kicking this around, looking at our project timelines and making sure that we're within a strong and confident range for 2024. We have two large projects that are coming online in Q3 and so feel confident in our ability to hit the project timelines on both the recycling and renewable energy side. I think you have to compare the $510 million to the $500 million, because the $500 million number was without the e-RINs and the third-party RNG projects. So, the best way to think about it is we've increased our target by $10 million for the renewable natural gas business. A portion of it is from the two new projects in Canada and then a mix of other benefits from our portfolio projects."

            "name": "Devina A. Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. Cost optimization was a significant theme in the fourth quarter and throughout 2023. Our team was pleased that our collective focus delivered WM's best ever full-year SG&A as a percentage of revenue of 9.4%. The 20 basis point improvement from prior year was realized through investments in customer facing technology, leveraging enhanced back office systems to become more efficient and a continuous focus on optimizing our spend. We're pleased with the progress made to improve this measure, while at the same time investing in our talent, customer engagement channels and technology capabilities. SG&A optimization delivered 20 basis points of our 90 basis point expansion and adjusted operating EBITDA margin in 2023. The remaining 70 basis points was from the collection and disposal business, which benefited from a combination of fuel price impacts and operating efficiencies. We gained meaningful traction in optimizing labor efficiency and repair and maintenance costs in our collection disposal business in the back half of the year, lifting our full-year adjusted operating EBITDA margin to 28.9%. This result is 30 basis points ahead of the high-end of our expectations and positions us to continue to deliver margin expansion in the year ahead. Our operating performance translated into robust cash flow in 2023. Our full-year cash flow from operations grew to $4.719 billion and our free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was nearly $2.7 billion. Each of these cash flow measures finished the year near the high-end of our initial guidance range. This result demonstrates our strong earnings growth, effective management of interest and taxes and optimizing cash conversion and our disciplined capital expenditure management processes. During 2023, we returned $2.44 billion to shareholders, paying $1.14 billion in dividends and repurchasing $1.3 billion of our stock. In addition, we spent $173 million on traditional solid waste and recycling acquisitions to grow our business. We accomplished all of this while accelerating our sustainability growth investments for future growth and development and maintaining our targeted leverage ratio of about 2.75 times. Our balance sheet remains strong and our earnings and cash flow growth are robust, positioning us to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth. Moving to our 2024 financial outlook, we're anticipating total company revenue growth between 6% and 7%, driven by organic growth in the collection and disposal business approaching 6%. Operating EBITDA is expected to grow by $450 million at the midpoint of our outlook. When we think about the cadence of our growth over the course of the year, we're expecting collection and disposal growth to be weighted more to the front half of the year, given the momentum we've gained from strong operating efficiencies in back half of 2023. And we're expecting sustainability business growth to be more significantly weighted to the back half of the year as our new recycling and renewable natural gas projects come online. Altogether, we expect this to result in a relatively balanced operating EBITDA growth over the course of the year. We expect capital spending to support the business for the year to total $2.25 billion of midpoint and we expect to invest another $875 million on our high-return sustainability growth projects. Free cash flow before these sustainability investments is anticipated to grow almost 7% at the midpoint to $2.85 billion. We remain committed to investing in an industry leading network of renewable energy and recycling assets, including renewable natural gas projects through recycling automation and new markets and advancements in resource recovery. Our sustainability growth investment strategy is progressing well. So, as you would expect, there have been a number of refinements to the plan since its inception. We've worked our way through customary changes to project schedules and impacts from inflation, all the while delivering completed projects that meet and sometimes exceed the environmental and economic objectives we planned. These successes have positioned us to grow the sustainability project pipeline. In particular, our refreshed outlook includes two new recycling projects in Canada that WM has awarded through a competitive process. We now expect growth investments across our recycling and renewable energy platforms to total between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion from 2022 through 2026. We expect these projects to contribute run rate adjusted operating EBITDA of about $800 million by the end of 2026. This outlook utilizes the same pricing assumptions we've used consistently, a $125 per ton for recycled commodities and $26 per MMBtu for renewable natural gas. We have a great deal of confidence in the value of the projects that are underway and we're enthusiastic about the strong complement they provide to our existing business. In conclusion, 2023 has clearly illustrated that we are driving growth through our diligent focus on optimizing our business, investing in technology and automation, and growing our leadership and sustainability. We take pride in our accomplishments and look forward to what we can achieve together in 2024. A heartfelt thank you to our dedicated team members who have been instrumental to our success. With that, Josh, let's open the line for questions. Yes, I think it's a great question, Noah. And similar to what we talked about in terms of the EBITDA dollar growth, the cadence, sorry, for margin is pretty similar. We expect margin expansion to be more heavily weighted towards the front half of the year particularly in the collection and disposal business, the SG&A margin expansion will be fairly even over 2024. But then with regard to the sustainability businesses, the commodity price benefits that we expect to see in 2024 aren't quite significant, right. They're pretty muted on a year-over-year basis. But as a reminder, commodity price expansion in the recycling line of business can have some margin compression because of the really high return on invested capital part of our brokerage business. And, on the renewable natural gas part of the business, we expect margin expansion there too because those are such great margin projects, but those will be heavily weighted toward the back half. So, from a margin perspective, while the collection and disposal business is definitely the thing that delivered in Q4, we do expect that to be the thing that lifts margin most significantly in the year ahead and that will be weighted toward the first half of the year. Yes, it's a great question. And your recollection of our outlook revision mid-year is spot on with regard to some of the softness we were seeing in the special waste part of the business. And, we saw a strong recovery of that in the fourth quarter, which is one of the reasons that we saw revenue exceed our expectations late in the year. We're not necessarily expecting a rebound of special waste volumes in the year ahead, but we are expecting some of this momentum that we saw in Q4 to carry over, but nothing outsized. The one thing that I would call out as a reminder with regard to some of the special project type work is 2023 did have a benefit from Hurricane Ian volumes particularly in the first quarter, and so that certainly will have an impact on the Q1 comparisons in 2024. Good morning. I definitely think the way that you summarized it there on the last part of your comment is the way that we're thinking about this, in particular when we were setting our margin expectations for the year ahead, the momentum that we have in the fourth quarter shows that we have tremendous confidence in having the cost improvement work that we've been so focused on as an organization through automation technology, and importantly, the delivery of trucks as something that we can continue to see benefits from in the year ahead. The caution for us, I would say that may have us below that seasonally adjusted margin outlook that you've done. It really relates to a couple of things. It's one, some of the weather impacts that we saw in January. Two, last year when we gave inflation outlook, we tended to see that inflation was sticking around and being more stubborn than we had predicted and so we're taking a more cautious view on inflationary pressures in the year ahead than we did a year ago. But really what I want to highlight is that, there's tremendous confidence in the fundamentals. The price cost spread has improved. The accelerated truck deliveries and our optimization efforts and the discipline in SG&A are all showing strong results. I think the best line to look at is actually our repair and maintenance line and the operating expense as a percentage of revenue category. And, over the long-term that had trended below 9% of revenue for us and through the first nine months of 2023, we were at 9.9%. That measure was down to 9.1% in Q4. So, we know that we've got some really strong momentum coming into the year ahead that will continue those cost benefits that you saw us produce in the fourth quarter. Into 2024, we just think that it's prudent to be on the conservative side when predicting full-year margin. Good morning. Sure. And Ed and Heather will be happy to walk you through any details I don't cover here. But, I'm glad, one, that the additional clarity is beneficial. The other that I would say is that on the IRG measures that we do, the internal revenue growth measures that we do, you'll see commodity price impact in a single line, which is recycling processes and renewable energy, so that's all price. And then you'll see the incremental volume from new projects, whether it be automation projects that have more throughput at the plant or the new Eco Vista plant that will be in the volume line. In terms of the segment reporting line, the only thing that might be a little bit of a complicating factor is the internal revenue between the renewables business and the collection and disposal business, you can think of it as the renewables business paying a royalty to the collection and disposal business associated with the landfill gas production that doesn't show up in the revenue line, because it's effectively just a cost for the renewables business. Hopefully that's helpful. So, the way to think about this is that when we gave that volume outlook that was just the collection and disposal volume. The renewable energy business increases. We have on a combined basis being in the range of 30 basis points to 60 basis points in the year ahead. And, that's a combination of commodity price impacts and volume. Yes, for Q4 specifically, again, the collection and disposal business and the efficiency that we drove was the lion's share of that improvement at 220 basis points. Fuel was another 50 basis points. So, that really does explain almost the entirety of it. There are a few other puts and takes, but I would say that my comments earlier about repair and maintenance and then John's comments about the labor line, those are the two places that are driving that 220 basis points of margin expansion. And then I'll just add a little bit of color that provide some clarity on a couple of the points that you brought up, Michael. One, with higher recycling commodity prices, the brokerage business can actually put downward pressure on margin. And so that's one of the things that we have built into our outlook for 2024. And then, in terms of wage inflation, we start at 4% with our folks. And so, wage inflation is still expected to be north of 4% when you take into account spot increases that we have to provide in certain markets to be responsive to various changes. So, 4% is kind of our baseline, and then you add on top of that. Yes. Basically, what we've always said is that we believe that our volume is about a 75% flow through from GDP. And so, we did have a fairly muted outlook with regard to GDP when we built our plan. I hope your crystal ball is better than mine, but I would tell you that our expectations for economic outlook continue to be that we need to be on the cautious side of things just because there's so much left in uncertainty, you saw that with today's print on CPI as an example, which exceeded expectations. On the ITC point, Michael, just so that we're crystal clear in terms of the implications of that on our 2024 guidance. We contemplated $120 million of ITC benefit in our free cash flow outlook for the year. So, we want to take a breath and celebrate, all of the incremental transparency we've provided. We're really proud of the work that the team did because, while it looks easy, it isn't. There's a whole lot of work that went into it. With regard to the more, I would say, operational driver elements of the reporting, we'll continue to evaluate whether or not there's anything that it's a strong complement to the financial measures and consider any additions in the years ahead. But right now, we're going to continue to execute on this strong reporting that we've been able to accomplish. And, we actually would like to see the industry follow suit in terms of providing additional visibility because we think it's beneficial. So, the K will be released early today and we're in good shape for that. So, thank you to the team. With regard to the quarterly data, you'll get that over the course of the year. It'll have the full-year data. The quarterly recast will come quarter-by-quarter. Good morning. So there's two key things that I would want everyone to bear in mind as you think about our trajectory. The first is in 2024, we're going to have roughly 40 projects under construction at any given time. So, that really gives you a sense of how we're building and we have a lot of momentum in the ramp. The second key piece is really exiting 2024, we're going to be approaching roughly $300 million in run rate EBITDA which gives you a sense of where we're headed on that ramp to the $800 million. So, what we're really seeing in 2024 is a true build of momentum on reaching that $800 million target. We can specifically confirm that number for you. We didn't refresh that. But the key takeaway for us there, whether it's 70% or 90%, and that's kind of the zip code that I think we should be thinking about. The free cash flow conversion in these businesses is stronger because, the maintenance capital is lower. And so, it is right to think about that being a really strong fundamental contributing factor to the long-term yield of this business."

Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter results are a testament to our team's ability to deliver on the priorities we set for 2023, including increasing profitability through disciplined pricing and optimizing our cost structure. Against the challenging backdrop, we have remained focused on the things we can control and this diligent focus is evident in our third quarter results. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew by more than 6% and margin expanded 100 basis points to 29.6% when compared to Q3 of 2022. Our strong results in the quarter were powered by our solid waste business. Organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business remains solid and is tracking well against our expectations. Third quarter core price of 6.6% reflects robust price performance across all lines of business. We're also pleased with the resilience of our solid waste volumes as commercial volumes turned mostly positive and special waste growth improved from the second quarter. And what really stands out for this quarter is our success in managing the middle of the P&L. We continue to drive SG&A leverage and we're also gaining momentum on operating cost optimization and efficiency gains. Our long-term focus on using automation and technology to optimize our cost structure is paying off, as we're choosing not to replace certain high turnover difficult-to-fill positions. Since January of 2022, we've leveraged attrition and technology to reduce headcount by 1,650 positions. We continue to be focused on the full opportunity of 5,000 to 7,000 position eliminations through attrition and technology over four to five years, and we're pleased with this progress to date. You'll hear more details about our cost performance from John and Devina. Putting it all together, our focus on price, efficiency and cost control translated into the strong operating leverage we produced in the quarter. Turning to our strategic investments in sustainability growth, the investment proposition for growing our renewable energy and recycling business remains strong and our project execution is tracking well. Our seventh renewable natural gas plant and the third of 20 facilities in our growth program is expected to be in service in January. And we have another four facilities on track for completion in 2024, including two of the largest projects in the portfolio, Fairless in Pennsylvania and Orchard Hills in Illinois. On the recycling front, we've completed technology and automation upgrades at two facilities in the quarter. And we have two more upgrades at a new facility in Nashville slated to begin service by the end of this year. Our automated network continues to drive great results by pushing our labor and processing costs lower, improving throughput and driving enhanced material quality, which benefits the recycling business in any commodity environment. Yet again, in the third quarter, we saw materially lower labor cost per ton at our automated facilities at about 35% below the rest of our recycling network. Our investments in developing the blueprint for a modern recycling facility sets us apart within the communities we serve and are unlocking further growth opportunities. With one quarter remaining in the year, we're well positioned to deliver on the 2023 financial outlook we provided last quarter, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 6% at the midpoint. We continue to expect a margin run rate exiting the year of about 29%, underpinned by 62% operating expenses as a percent of revenue and 9% SG&A as a percent of revenue. We're pleased with our results through the first nine months of the year. Our team is very focused on price discipline and cost optimization to deliver a strong finish to the year and lay the groundwork for further growth in 2024. I want to thank each of our team members for their commitment to our customers and their many contributions to our success. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd like to open by highlighting the strides we're making in optimizing our cost structure. In the third quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 90 basis points year-over-year to 61.3%. The collection and disposal business contributed 70 basis points of this improvement due to the strong operating leverage provided by our cost optimization efforts. In addition, we achieved pricing leverage as core price exceeded cost inflation by an estimated 100 basis points in the quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made in managing our labor costs, as well as expenses related to repair and maintenance. Our efforts have resulted in a meaningful decline in WM's underlying cost of inflation since the beginning of the year to mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Our focus on efficiently managing labor expenses is yielding positive results. So far this year, we have automated 141 residential routes and have a target to convert more than 400 routes in 2024. As we shift to more automated routes, we've seen a nearly 14% decrease in the number of helpers needed in our residential business. In addition, our focus on reducing turnover continued to produce improvements in Q3, building on the consistent progress we've made over the past 12 months. Our collection efficiency has also exhibited steady progress throughout the year with commercial, industrial, and residential business line showing improvements every quarter. All these focus areas on managing our business are contributing to the improvement in labor costs. Turning to repair and maintenance expenses. Despite some lingering effects of inflation and the timing of fleet deliveries, we're making progress. For the first time in several years, we expect to get an allotment of vehicles that aligns with our fleet replacement strategy with more than 1,200 received to-date. This has allowed us to remove older trucks from our fleet and also reduce rental truck usage by over 40% since the start of the year. Furthermore, our spending on third-party technicians has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the second half of 2022 and continues to improve. With the progress we've achieved in the third quarter, we believe we've turned the corner on this expense line and are optimistic about ongoing improvements as we close out the year. Turning to our revenue growth. We continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our third quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 5.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. This growth was led by core price of 6.6% with collection and disposal yield of 5%. Our differentiated service offering is generating value with our national account customers as well as commercial customers. We continue to focus on maximizing customer lifetime value and our Q3 churn of 9% remains at the low end of our historical range, demonstrating the positive momentum we are seeing with customers valuing our service offerings. Looking at volumes. Third quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. Our landfill business drove most of the volume growth as special waste grew 11.1% on a workday-adjusted basis in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not separate special waste into yield in volume and in Q3, we benefited from several high-priced projects that drove the increase. So, we've highlighted in previous conversations, the timing and pricing of special waste projects is subject to variability due to their discretionary nature. However, our project pipeline remains robust. In addition, Workday adjusted MSW volumes were up 1.7% in the quarter. Our overall collection volumes were down modestly due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from our roll-off business. Yet both revenue and operating EBITDA continue to grow in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth. Net new business and net service increases remained solidly positive and growth in our strategic accounts business, driven by our differentiated offerings, continues to outpace our expectations. Thus, overall collection and disposal organic growth is on pace for the year. With regard to recycling and renewable energy, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and our recently automated recycling facilities are delivering strong results. As Jim discussed, our sustainability growth projects are tracking well and we're confident that our operating EBITDA expectations for the year remain in the range provided last quarter. In closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to our frontline teams for their dedication to providing safe and dependable service to our customers and communities each day. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks John, and good morning. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on the fundamental value drivers of our business, disciplined revenue growth and cost optimization. Executing on these fundamentals positioned us to deliver WM's best ever operating EBITDA margin in the third quarter at 29.6%. This is a 100 basis point improvement compared to Q3 of 2022 and it can be attributed almost entirely to 70 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business. SG&A leverage provided the remaining expansion. We're pleased with the team's focus on optimizing costs and reducing discretionary spending, which together positioned us to deliver SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue of 9%, showing that this long-term goal is not just achievable, it is largely in hand. While the current quarter result has some benefit from lower current year incentive compensation costs, we see this level of SG&A is sustainable, particularly as revenue grows. While there were a number of other margin impacts in the quarter, mostly related to fuel, energy and commodities, these items basically offset each other, giving us confidence that this quarter's results are based on the steps we are taking to price our services above inflation and to permanently reduce our cost structure. Through the first nine months of 2023, we have expanded operating EBITDA margin by 40 basis points to 28.5%, putting us squarely on track to achieve our full year target of operating EBITDA margin of 28.4% to 28.6%. Our operating performance has translated into robust cash flow from operations. Through the first three quarters of the year, cash flow from operations exceeded $3.3 billion, positioning us to deliver more than $4.5 billion of cash from operations for the year. As we expected, cash flow associated with operating EBITDA growth in 2023 has been largely offset by higher interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments. Despite these known headwinds, our conversion of revenue dollars to cash from operations and operating EBITDA dollars to free cash flow in the base business were both near peak levels in the quarter, demonstrating the sustainable value creation from our diligent focus on optimizing the middle of the P&L and/or capital expenditures. Capital spending in the first nine months of the year totaled almost $1.9 billion with $1.456 billion related to normal course capital and $397 million of spending on sustainability growth projects. We now expect sustainability growth capital spending of about $750 million in 2023. The $150 million decrease from prior expectations is based on a shift in the timing of spending across the next two to three quarters. As a result of this lower anticipated capital spending, 2023 free cash flow is expected to be $150 million above our prior expectations and in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. Free cash flow through the first nine months of the year was $1.552 billion, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.949 billion. We're confident in our ability to achieve our full year targeted free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of between $2.575 billion and $2.675 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $855 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchased $990 million of our stock. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.73 times, which is at the midpoint of our target ratio of between 2.5 times and 3 times. 9% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, our pre-tax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was 3.9%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth opportunities. Looking at our full year expectations. Our solid operational performance in the first nine months of the year positions us to achieve the operating EBITDA guidance we provided last quarter of $5.775 billion to $5.875 billion. This strong result will be achieved with continued focus on pricing our services to recover cost inflation differentiating WM's value proposition with customers to maintain and grow the right volumes and optimizing both operating costs and SG&A. We expect full year revenue growth to be modestly below the midpoint of our July 2023 guidance of 3.25% to 4.25%. Most aspects of our revenue outlook remain intact, but we have seen lower revenue than planned in our recycling brokerage businesses. Given the relatively small operating EBITDA impact from the brokerage business, this refreshed revenue outlook does not impact any other component of our guidance. To sum it up, we're pleased with our performance throughout 2023. We firmly believe that leveraging technology and automation to enhance our operations and investing in our sustainability businesses are positioning us for future success. We're grateful for the hard work of the entire WM team. Their dedication to safely serve our customers and communities will ensure we finish the year strong and move into 2024 even stronger. With that, Victor, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Bryan Burgmeier from Citi. Your line is open.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good morning, and thank you for taking the question. \nJim Fish: Good morning.\nBryan Burgmeier: Thinking about some of the underlying guidance components, volume is maybe a little bit better than your original view and on that maybe points to a little bit of upside on recycling and renewables versus the guidance you put out in July. I guess, A, do you agree with that to be - it will seem like we maybe could be pointing towards the higher end of the EBITDA range? I think you said 6% EBITDA growth at the midpoint, which is maybe a tough higher but that is towards your model. Any detail you can add there? Thank you.\nJim Fish: Yes. So I guess a couple of - you mentioned volume, then you mentioned the EBITDA range. So I'll tackle volume first here, Bryan. When we looked at volume, we were obviously pleased with a couple of things, special waste, as I mentioned, was slightly better. Some of that was rate related, really. But for the most part, volume was as we expected, which was fairly flat. We said at the beginning of the year that volume would be flat. And it's been fairly flat all year. Third quarter was slightly better than the first two quarters. I think the collection volumes have been flat pretty much all year long. It's been a - it's different from one line of business to another. Resi almost really by design has been down probably for a couple of years at roll-off was probably the more disappointing of the lines of business and then commercial might have been the one that was more encouraging. So commercial was up slightly, roll off down and then resi by design. And then within the landfill line of business, not anything really unexpected there other than maybe special waste and maybe C&D a little bit. C&D has a little bit of a mix there. And in particularly when you get to the fourth quarter, C&D is really going to be a difficult comparison because of the hurricane last year. But overall volume, I think is not - it's not going to be a big change when you get into the fourth quarter. And honestly, what you're going to see in 2024, and we'll give, of course, our guidance when we get to the next quarter, but 2024 is going to sound pretty similar to 2023, I think, when it comes to volume. I guess when it comes to the EBITDA range - and we anticipated that there would be a question of, okay, so nice performance on EBITDA. So why not give us a number in the higher end of the range. And I would just tell you, there's going to be a natural level of conservatism here because whether it is - not that we're affected much by geopolitics, but there's a lot going on right now that makes it a little bit hard to see out into beyond a month or two. I think that's why 2024 is still a question for us. How does 2024 look? We're going to wait three months before we really try and put a pin on 2024. But for 2023, we're comfortable with the range. We feel comfortable with the quarter. And to the extent that it ends up where we expect, then we were right to not change it. If it's higher than we expected, then it beat us up at that point.\nBryan Burgmeier: Understood. Yes. Thank you for all the details, Jim. Last question for me. If I heard you correctly in the prepared remarks, I think you said you're looking to bring four or five RNG facilities online next year. I think that would be essentially in line with your original plan from January. Is it fair to assume that most of the construction delays that we're seeing in the CapEx line are related to recycling? Can you put a finer point on the facilities might be coming online to 2024? Or is it a little bit too soon to speculate, right? Thanks, and I'll turn it over.\nTara Hemmer: Sure. This is Tara Hemmer, Chief Sustainability Officer. I think there are two key takeaways that we want you to hear from us related to our sustainability-related investments. And the first is our level of confidence in our 2026 EBITDA projections, the $500 million for renewable energy, the $240 million for recycling. We've spent a lot of time really looking at our projects and we're very confident in our ability to deliver those numbers in 2026.  The second thing that is important to note and it's one of the reasons why we have this level of confidence is in 2024, we expect to have about 40 projects under active construction. So that gives you a sense of the momentum that we're building within the platform. If you look at the capital related to some of the shifts, it is related to both recycling and renewable energy. It's not just specific to recycling. So I want to leave you with that. But the important thing to remember is these capital shifts that we see, we see something similar in our traditional business where construction projects really don't know calendar years. And so some of this is about shifting some things from Q4 into Q1 and Q2.\nBryan Burgmeier: Understood. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question will come from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James. Your line is open.\nTyler Brown: Hi. Good morning guys.\nJim Fish: Good morning.\nDevina Rankin: Hi.\nTyler Brown: Hi. John, I know it's early, but it does feel like unit cost inflation is starting to ease. I'm just curious, you said mid-single-digit unit cost inflation in the quarter, but can you be a little bit more specific on what that was? And two, just any early thoughts on how you guys are thinking about core price into next year in order to offset unit cost inflation to get to that 29% margin that Devina talked about.\nJohn Morris: Yes. Good question, Tyler. I would tell you, let me start with wages because that's 1 I've used as a barometer. When you look at where we were beginning of the year Q1, it was double digits. It was 10%, 11%. And when you look sort of right, the big buckets of labor drivers, technicians, have equipment operators. Those numbers are down between 5% and 6% in Q3. So almost half of where they were. So that's part of what we're seeing from inflation moderation. I think on the M&R side, too, maintenance and repairs, part of my prepared remarks is we got 1,200 trucks, and we'll end up with about over 1,300 for the year and we're seeing the same kind of progress in our maintenance and repair expenses. When you look at it in whole dollars or on a percentage basis, we've sort of gone from the mid-teens down to low double digits and now we're in the 6% to 7% range for Q3. So as Devina said, we're not claiming victory there yet. But I think the combination of us getting assets, some moderation in the big buckets, labor being one of them, are what you're seeing translate to the 61.3% in the quarter from an OpEx perspective. On the core price side, I mean, Jim said in his opening comments, it's not really been so much about the core price going through. It's about what are we retaining. And I think when you look at the margin expansion you saw relative to the OpEx. And you heard in my prepared remarks about us making margin and EBITDA improvements in all lines of business. I think that's the end result we're shooting for. So our pricing strategy holistically is working, and I don't think you're going to see any change in that.\nDevina Rankin: Tyler, I'll just add a little bit of color in terms of specific amounts when we look at core price covering cost inflation for the portfolio overall. We talked about in Q3 that getting to a positive 100 basis points, which is fantastic for us to see. As you can appreciate, pricing activities don't link directly to when we see cost inflation. And so when we look at Q1 and Q2, the variance between those two measures was a negative 500 basis points. In Q2, we had improved to negative 250 basis points. So what you see is the continued progress in terms of making sure that on an annual basis, we are seeing those pricing activities cover our cost inflation and when you couple that with the cost optimization efforts that we're putting forth to more efficiently run the business and getting some help from truck deliveries we're really starting to see the math associated with price covering inflation and hopefully getting to a point at some point where we start to see that as a lever for incremental margin expansion as well really take hold in the third quarter.\nTyler Brown: Yes, perfect. I totally get the timing. So I kind of want to shift gears just a little bit. This is for Jim and Tara. I get it that you guys are not giving guidance, and I totally appreciate that. But I do get a lot of questions about the EBITDA contribution from RNG and recycling specifically in 2024. Because if you go back to the Investor Day, I think you're supposed to get something like $225 million combined incrementally from those two. But on the other hand, you guys are pushing CapEx. It sounds like there's some delays I get it may be that, that build was directional, but can you just give any broad stress on what that EBITDA contribution would be next year? I think it would be extremely helpful.\nJim Fish: Yes. We can both kind of address this, Tyler, right. I think, first of all, it's important to understand, and Tara mentioned it in her first question there that we really would prefer that you anchor on that $740 million. That's the number that truly is to be modeled against. The other numbers, look, there's - because of the movement and we anticipated some movement in capital spending, we anticipate some movement in permitting. We've had a good story on permitting in Canada. I mean so - but we've also had delays on supply chain and hence, the movement around in CapEx from one quarter to another. And so the numbers that we gave were really more of a buildup to that $740 million, not intended to be guidance. So that's, I think, first point. The second point here is that with 40 active projects ongoing, there's - and a lot of movement by the way, both in recycling commodity prices and D3 RIN pricing, natural gas pricing, those businesses are really - it's why we wait to give guidance until February. I know companies give a lot of guidance this time of year. But our preference is to wait and give ourselves a bit more time, particularly in today's in today's climate, where visibility isn't fantastic. You can't look off the bow at a ship and see for 20 miles. Now it's not 10 feet either, but it's not 20 miles. So we're really giving ourselves the benefit of a little bit of extra time before we try and answer that question directly. And I'm not trying to punch your question, but it is just going to be much easier for us, for Tara or Shahid for that whole team for Brent Bell to give a very precise answer in early February than it is today.\nTara Hemmer: And we'll be much further along in our construction process for those 2024 projects.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Yes. No, I completely get it. And maybe just my last one kind of in the same day, and I'll try again in a little bit different way, but it looks like you deferred about $230 million, I think, from your original guidance on green CapEx. So should we think about $750 million kind of maybe being a number to use for next year as well just on the CapEx side? Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Tyler, I'll take that really quickly. But deferral in 2023 was $350 million in the aggregate from where we started the year. Some of that will roll into 2024, as Tara mentioned, because it really is just kind of a not writing the check in December, but instead writing it in January or February. But then we do expect that some of what we had anticipated as 2024 capital could move into 2025. And so it's difficult to say that we'll just take that $350 million and added on to what we had previously projected for 2024 because we will have some shift from 2024 into 2025. But all in all, those projects, the confidence in them that Tara spoke to, I think, is the most important point. For us, it's making sure that we do the right thing from a working capital management perspective, and pay for this capital when it's placed into service or aligning those two as best we can.\nTyler Brown: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer from Truist Securities. Your line is open. \nJasper Bibb: Hi, good morning. This is Jasper Bibb on for Tobey. I wanted to ask about the SG&A optimization effort. I think if I heard you correctly in the prepared remarks, there was a comment about current SG&A levels being sustainable. So as we look out to 2024, should we think about SG&A at 9% of revenue being a good starting point for the year? Or any context there would be helpful.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, that's exactly right. When we look at the levers that have been used to deliver SG&A in the current year, it really is our focus on technology and optimization, particularly with some of the success that we've seen in customer experience and sales. And that customer engagement model is something that we know will continue to create momentum in the years ahead. And the cost discipline as well has been really important. So 9% as a percentage of revenue, we feel like is a new long-term sustainable level of SG&A going forward.\nJim Fish: It's probably worth mentioning here, too, that - I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, the 5,000 to 7,000 positions that would come out through attrition that has to-date and so far, the number I gave was 1,650 positions since January of 2022. To-date, that has mostly been SG&A type positions. The big buckets going forward to get us to that 5% to 7% are mostly OpEx position. So when I think about what's happened today, most of those positions came out of our customer experience department where we've used technology to really automate a lot of that. Our call volume has been down as much as 25%. So those positions that had high turnover, 50%-ish type turnover we just chose to not replace. Going forward, the big buckets where you'll get up to that 5,000 to 7,000 range, the big buckets become recycling automation. Now that is ongoing. I talked about a 35-ish percent reduction in labor cost per tonne. But as Tara mentioned, there's a lot of projects ongoing. We're not even close to even one-third of the way through those. So there's a lot of positions yet to come out in our recycling business. Those largely fall into the OpEx category. Then John mentioned the conversion from rear load to ASL. Some of those have taken place this year, but probably three times as many next year. And then the last bucket, which is probably the most difficult one, and we have talked about it quite a bit, but is route optimization. That involves a lot of technology. It involves a lot of process change, but there's also a lot of payback in that when we get it right. So those buckets are mostly OpEx buckets. The previous buckets in that 1,650 positions were mostly SG&A.\nJasper Bibb: That makes a lot of sense. And then I was hoping to follow-up on the sustainability capital spending. I guess, what are the most frequent issues you're seeing that are delaying these projects, whether it's supply chain or permitting? And the projects that were already delayed earlier this year, any color on what's been the experience or the time line on resolving those earlier delays?\nTara Hemmer: Sure. The biggest issues that we have been seeing we're really in two key categories. The first is on utility interconnects, and we're making progress on utility interconnect for us. That's on the electrical side and then also getting the connectivity to be able to push the gas into the system. And so we've been working hard on making sure that we have those agreements in place. And then the second piece, it's construction related, but I would put it more into the permitting category, and we've made a lot of progress on obtaining many of our permits that are necessary on the RNG side. So from a supply chain perspective, we've done a fantastic job of really making sure that we have built slots on equipment\u2019s for both our recycling business and our renewable energy business. So that's less of a risk.\nJim Fish: Yes Tobey, we talked about yesterday, the single biggest plan, and I mentioned it in my remarks, which is Fairless in Pennsylvania. That is our single biggest plan that we will build in the 20 and to give you some perspective, that plant was originally, originally scheduled for opening in the second quarter, beginning of May. And it's pushed a little bit. And right now, it looks like it's scheduled to open at the end of June. So it's pushed a couple of months. But I think that gives you a good feel for what's happening here. We're not talking about pushing things back 12 to 15 months, they're moving in kind of 60-day - 30- to 60-day increments, but it is having some effect on CapEx, for example, but I think the fact that we've got 40 active recycle and RNG plants in 2024, you'll have quite a few more - you'll have another big chunk in 2025. And then we get to 2026, we're very comfortable with the end number.\nJasper Bibb: That super helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone.\nJim Fish: Good morning Jerry.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: I'm wondering, if you folks can talk about the opportunity for lower R&M and what that could mean for you folks. Really interesting in the quarter to see your operating expenses essentially flattish, given John, the inflation items that you mentioned earlier. And so as you folks get the truck deliveries online, et cetera, how much further could the cost structure improve off of the strong levels we're seeing in 3Q?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, Jerry, I think it's a great point and John and I have spoken a lot about this. I think one of the best indicators is when you look at the year-over-year increase that we have been seeing in the first half of the year for repair and maintenance costs, that was 14.1% in the first six months of the year. In the third quarter, that was up only 6.9% as the deliveries that we've talked about finally are getting on the road and we're able to get the older assets off the street the team members are having to run much longer than our plans because we hadn't gotten or a lot of trucks for the last 18 months or so. So when we look at sustainable levels of repair and maintenance increase, we think that there's, some good tailwinds coming in the fourth quarter and into early 2024. And when you just look at that 1 metric alone, I think it's a great indication.\nJerry Revich: Devina, thank you. Just to clarify, so it sounds like it could be not just lower inflation going forward. It sounds like it could actually be a decline in spending, if I understood your comments correctly?\nDevina Rankin: No. What we're hesitant to say is a decline in spend, because while there are some parts inflation places where we've actually seen costs going backward and that should give us some benefits. There are places where we're just still catching up with regard to making sure that we've got the right assets in the right places to service the customers. We do think in the first half of next year, you could see effectively flatter cost in repair and maintenance. And that's what we're working towards.\nJohn Morris: I think the other benefit, Jerry, is just a little bit more detail than the M&R question, but it's not just M&R. We're also seeing it show up in other parts of the business, in particular, in labor and efficiency, right, because when we're putting newer trucks on the street that obviously benefits in other places just as opposed to maintenance and repairs. And we're seeing that show up in efficiency.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can I shift gears, and Tara ask you, if you don't mind. How are you thinking about the allocation of gas that's coming online towards the transportation versus utilities? So it looks like based on the EPA October report, there's about a $10 million and BTU shortfall towards transportation applications. And so, as you think about where you're putting the gas to use, how does satisfying and making sure that, that market gets enough supply factor into your decision versus the allocation plan that we spoke about at the sustainability today?\nTara Hemmer: Yes. I mean we're still targeting and using that framework that we had in place, really thinking one year out having 70% to 90% of our volume locked up two years out in that 40% range and then three years out, 10% to 30%. I think what we have to be clear about is when we think about that, it is transportation versus voluntary market, but you can also do fixed priced or longer term deals in either market, and we're going to be accessing both of those. If you think about our portfolio for 2024, one thing that's important to note is we had done some deals in the voluntary market. A great example is we did one with a large utility 20-year agreement with pricing that's north of $20 a ton - sorry, $20 per MMBtu, old garbage gallon, I mean, at $20 per MMBtu. So on a blended basis, if you look at 2024, we have roughly 30% today of our volume locked up, and that will, of course, have an impact on pricing. We are tracking very closely the transportation market, and we've been watching what's happening with RINs and the price pop. What's important to note there though is, we don't necessarily access the spot market. We are looking at the spot market but also selling forward. So we want to just caution people about just taking a $3.4 RIN price that RINs are trading at today for future pricing in 2024.\nJim Fish: It helps the future market.\nTara Hemmer: Absolutely. Absolutely. Like, we're more positive pricing going forward into the fourth quarter and of course, 2024.\nJerry Revich: Super. Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Hi. Thanks so much. First, just a clarifying question following up from Tyler, 29% margin, is that the 4Q number or is that kind of the bogey for 2024? I just want to make sure that we all understand that are on the same page.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. The way that we've looked at the 29% is basically the second half of 2023. Our target was to deliver 29% EBITDA margin. What you see is a 29.6% in the third quarter that modestly outpaced our expectations for the quarter. So it gives us some room in terms of our fourth quarter expectations. But Q4, you can expect us to be in the range of the 28.5% to 29% margin.\nNoah Kaye: Perfect. Thank you. Clearly, a big story this quarter is those gains right in margins largely from managing the middle. So I want to delve a little bit more into both labor and equipment availability. Just on the labor side, where is turnover currently? How has that progressed? And then I think in the release, there was a call out of some modest costs for upcoming collective bargaining anything we should be aware of there in terms of how that impacts labor trends.\nJohn Morris: Yes. The collective bargaining comment was simply some dollars we spent in preparation for some contracts we had in the Midwest, which thankfully got resolved. But when we have big agreements like that, it's not uncommon for us to spend some money to make sure we're prepared for the worst, so to speak. But in this case, it was a better outcome and those are behind us. And on the labor front, part of my comment earlier was just in the moderation of rate inflation that we've seen from 10%, 11% coming out of last year into the first quarter or two of this year and now being closer to the 5% to 6% range in terms of the rate that labor is going up. And you put that against the backdrop of our pricing strategy, which Jim commented on, we continue - we're seeing a better spread between what's happened with inflation and some of those costs, in this case, specifically labor.\nNoah Kaye: And the turnover? Yes, go ahead, please.\nJohn Morris: And the turnover is still a good story. That was part of my prepared remarks, too, and driver being the biggest. We have about 21,000 drivers in the network and we're continuing to see improvement there down into the low 20s from probably a peak up in the high 20s to close to 30% 18 months ago.\nJim Fish: Yes. I was just going to say, no, I mean, what you're really hearing here, and it's not just specific to your questions, but to all questions is what we've been saying for several quarters, which is there's a few things that are outside of our control. And we're very focused on those things that are within our control might sound obvious, but it's not going to sound that different when we get to 2024. And while we're not giving specific numbers for 2024, I would tell you that when we get to 2024, pricing is going to continue to be good. We're going to continue to focus, as Devina said and John have said on the middle of the P&L. We feel good about the progress we're making on OpEx. We feel great about the progress we've made on SG&A. It wasn't that long ago that we were talking about getting below 11%. Now we're saying the number is 9%. So - but I think the technology that we've been talking about for probably three years is finally starting to show that it really is going to produce some results. And then there's a bit of a hangover from the pandemic where we - where there were some things that we simply didn't expect that affected turnover that affected supply chain, obviously, inflation all of that, I think we've really, really gotten our hands around and now we're starting, as John mentioned in his detailed prepared remarks, pull units out that have been sitting on the fence that really we've been keeping there as just kind of a cautionary move on our part. So 2024 is going to look, I think, pretty similar. It's going to look fairly flat on volume. It's going to look good on price. We finally will get a little bit of tailwind when it comes to our sustainability businesses because 2023 was tough from that standpoint. And finally, we'll see some year-over-year positive comps on commodity prices. I think in our RNG business, we've talked a lot about RIN pricing. That looks like it's - it could end up being a good positive year-over-year comp, same with natural gas, last year, Q4 was difficult because of the Ukraine spike in natural gas pricing, all of that kind of went away if you look at natural gas pricing in the first quarter. So I think you're going to see a fairly another year where we're saying, here's what we're focused on. We're not going to try and predict what happens with the economy. But those things that we can control, I think, we're doing a pretty darn good job of controlling them.\nNoah Kaye: For sure. And I just wanted to follow-up less quickly on the truck delivery side. It's been great. And clearly, you're seeing that benefit on the MNR of those increased deliveries you already comment to what you expect this year? I know there have been some investor questions around the impact of the UAW strike at Mack, but we do have built slots opening up for 2024 now. Can you just comment into visibility into continued strong truck deliveries?\nJohn Morris: Yes. We're actually in pretty good shape. That's an unfortunate situation. But we've talked to our supply chain team between Devina and I and the build slots that we have and the trucks really going into the first half of next year don't look like they're going to be impacted, partly because we take delivery of chassis a lot earlier than we take delivery of the truck because it's another manufacturer that's involved in that. So we're in pretty good shape there.\nNoah Kaye: Excellent. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for next question. And our next question will come from the line of Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nHans Hoffman: Hi. This is Hans on for Stephanie. I was just curious if we could sort of bridge the 100 bps of margin expansion. I know you guys kind of called out sort of optimizing the overall cost structure in the collection and disposable side, but just curious if you could sort of parse out the other item impacts like fuel, ITC and M&A?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So collection and disposal of 70 basis points plus SG&A of 20 basis points basically tells the story, but then we've got puts and takes and the biggest piece there is the timing of the alternative fuel tax credit and that was a headwind of 50 basis points. That was almost entirely offset by the impact of lower fuel prices and our surcharge structure, and that was a 40 basis point impact in the quarter. Then you had recycling and renewable energy, recycling was positive 20 basis points renewable energy was negative 20 basis points. So again, those two offset each other. And we've talked all year about having some dilutive impact from M&A because of the type of acquisitions we had on the recycling brokerage side as well as just a typical ramp of getting good solid waste tuck-in acquisitions to WM standards. That impact has lessened in the third quarter relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year, and that was at about 40 basis points in the first half down to about 20 basis in the third quarter.\nHans Hoffman: Got it. That's helpful. And then just kind of shifting gears a bit. Just kind of curious if you could talk about the greatest - where do you have the greatest sort of pricing opportunity? And how should we be thinking about your pricing power in a lower inflationary environment. And I was also just sort of wondering if you could just remind us what percent of the restricted book is tied to waste and see trash collection portion of CPI versus actual headline CPI. I think it's kind of important as that kind of component has been accelerating kind of for most of this year and probably will average a point or two higher than headline CPI, which could have some impact on pricing next year.\nJim Fish: Yes. The number we usually give is about 40% is tied to some type of index. Not necessarily water sewer trash, that's one of the indices, but about 40% is tied to an index. There tends to be a bit of a look back on that, a lag. So to the extent that, that number is climbing, that ends up being a positive for us. It just - it takes a little while to get to that full positive. I think to your first question about where we expect pricing to be good. Look, I think pricing has been pretty consistently good across the board. In years past, particularly probably as far back as five years ago, pricing was pretty good, but it was very focused on one line of business. That has changed over the last few years where we've been good with pricing across the board. But I think the piece that we've all touched on a little bit here today that I'll reiterate is really the net price. It's not something we used to talk about, because there wasn't a whole lot of inflation in the economy. But if I just use Q2 of 2022, because that was kind of the high watermark for inflation, so CPI at 9.5% in Q2 of 2022 and if I look at our core price for collection disposal was 7.5% in Q2 of 2022 and yield was 6.2%. Now we're looking at a CPI in the 4% range. I think 4.1% was the exact number. And our Q3 collection disposal core price was 6.6% and yield is 5%. So we've completely flipped the tables there, where in Q2 of 2022, CPI is 300 or 400 basis points in front of our price. And now we flip the table. So collectively, we're kind of recovering - we're adding margin now, whereas we were five quarters ago seeing margin decline. But overall, I think we're on a nice trajectory with respect to margin growth. And that really is a function of having a more manageable CPI. I know one of the questions that quarter was what's the optimal level of inflation? And my kind of smart answer was, well, it's not 9.5%. I think we're - if I were asked that question today, I'd say we're much closer to an optimal level of inflation, because we're able to recover with our pricing programs across the board.\nJohn Morris: The only thing I would add there, Jim, is when you look at our customer metrics, which is another benchmark and you look at our new business, our lost business, our net new, our churn numbers, our rollbacks, all those KPIs around how that's impacting the customer are still on a good trajectory as well. So to your point, it feels like overall, we're in a good spot.\nHans Hoffman: Got it. Super helpful and if I could just sneak one more question in. Just kind of curious with labor turnover improving, one, just sort of wondering how we should maybe think about productivity or efficiency gains as employees kind of mature into their positions?\nJohn Morris: Yes, I think that's a great question. One of the friction points, obviously, of turnover is the experience level, and that does translate to two things. One, it can translate to safety and it could translate to efficiency and we've seen positive momentum since the beginning of the year for each quarter in each line of business. And two of the three lines of business went back positive in the quarter. All three were positive in September. We're seeing the positive efficiency momentum continue into October. So that's probably the best benchmark for us to look at in terms of where that shows up.\nHans Hoffman: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. Our next question will come from the line of Dave Manthey from Baird. Your line is open. Dave Manthey from Baird. Your line is open.\nDave Manthey: Can you hear me now? Hello?\nJim Fish: Yes, I hear you. Yes, we got you.\nDave Manthey: Oh, you got me now. Okay. Hi. Thank you. Good morning. So my question is any of the $350 million sustainability CapEx being cut at all? Or is it just being pushed to the right? And then is the plan to catch-up between now and 2026? Or is the time line potentially elongated from here?\nTara Hemmer: So none of it is cut. And yes, the plan is to catch up. As Devina mentioned earlier, it would be spread throughout 2024 and 2025 with some of what was originally in '24 moving to 2025.\nDave Manthey: Okay. Thank you. And second, a couple of random modeling questions here. 11.7 D3 RINs you generate per MMBtu. Is that a constant or can that fluctuate for some reason over time? And then second, I think you told us last quarter that something like 19% of your debt is floating rate, what is that percent today?\nTara Hemmer: So the 11.72 is constant. That's a constant conversion rate on the RINs.\nDevina Rankin: And then on the floating rate debt, we're at 9% currently.\nDave Manthey: 9%?\nDevina Rankin: Yes.\nDave Manthey: Perfect. Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: A quick piece of color on the 9% just in July, we went into the markets and secured really strong fixed rate debt on a long-term basis at a coupon of 4.875%. And so when you see the 10-year treasury where it is today, you can certainly say that we're really pleased with that timing.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our next question. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open. \nBrian Butler: Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Can you hear me?\nJim Fish: Yes.\nDevina Rankin: Yes.\nBrian Butler: Just to try to keep it quick. On the pricing side, when you talked about kind of that spread over inflation being negative in the first half of the year and kind of positive 100 basis points, how should we think about that going into the fourth quarter? And then maybe longer term, where does that spread - where do you hope that spread or target that spread to kind of even out in 2024 and kind of beyond?\nJim Fish: Yes. It's a little bit of the answer I gave previously, which was the spread obviously was working against us five quarters ago when you had inflation approaching 10%. And we just were not able to get to that number on either core price or yield. So we were looking at 7.5% core price, 6.2% yield. And now that relationship has really flipped around. So, you're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% CPI and declining by the way. And then price, whether it's yield at 5% or core price at 6.6%, we feel pretty comfortable that - by the way, I don't think inflation is going to 1% anytime soon. I think you'll probably see inflation in this range for the foreseeable future. So if that's the case, I'd like to be able to maintain our own price in this position where it's slightly above the inflation rate. And by the way, as John has mentioned, our own inflation is - doesn't track perfectly with CPI. So while we certainly have come down on labor inflation from the 10%, 11%, 12% that we were seeing a year, 1.5 years ago, we're still above that kind of 3% to 4% CPI number. So we need to get price in the 5% to 6% range, which is where I think you'll probably see it going into '24.\nBrian Butler: All right. That's helpful. And then on the - I know we talked a lot about the productivity and optimization. But just at a very high level, I mean when you think of what's left to do and what's been done, is it reasonable to believe that 2024 can produce kind of the similar kind of levels, if not better, than what you saw in 2023?\nJim Fish: I think we'll talk about 2024 when we get to February. But if you just look at what the progress we made kind of quarter-by-quarter, first half, second half, it would certainly give us a better exit ratio from an operating perspective and a margin perspective. And then I think Devina commented on that earlier. We still feel we have upside, and we've always talked about 50 to 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. And as Jim mentioned, we've been chasing that a little bit in the last couple of years because of supply chain and inflation and whatnot. It feels like we're in a much better spot coming out of 2023 than we were coming out of 2022.\nJim Fish: By the way, one thing we really don't talk about much when we talk about this rear load to ASL conversion. We talk about the heads coming out because there's obviously a helper on the back of a rear loader. What we don't talk much about is the pickup in efficiency or productivity because we are - our history, and we've got a long history of making these conversions. We are much more productive on an ASL than we are on a rear loader. So there's, I don't know, John, 20%, 25% pickup in productivity in the resi line of business where you're making those conversions.\nJohn Morris: That's a good number.\nBrian Butler: Okay. And then one last quick one. On the sustainability deferred spending, that's all process related. That's not waste management making a decision based on where market prices are to delay any of that. It's really just a matter of going through the mechanics of getting the approvals and things like that?\nTara Hemmer: Correct. We are full steam ahead, as I mentioned, with that about 40 projects under construction in 2024. That will tell you what you need to know there, we're moving forward.\nBrian Butler: All right. Great. Thanks again for fitting me in.\nTara Hemmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Kevin Chiang from CIBC. Your line is open.\nKevin Chiang: Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just one for me. I know this has been tackled quite a bit here. But it does sound like you have a number of - maybe I'll call the idiosyncratic cost containment programs in place, ones that maybe your competitors or smaller peers don't have. When you think longer term about that price over inflation spread and the typical margin expansion you'd want to get. Wouldn't that increase given those idiosyncratic opportunities? Or do you would you price above your own inflation versus, let's say, industry inflation and essentially those savings get, for lack of a better word, maybe competed away as you go to the market?\nDevina Rankin: I think it's a great question. I think what's most important is that while we compete in the marketplace, we also compete with ourselves and working to continuously improve our business. And so price is one element of how we grow our business and another part of how we grow our business is ensuring that our cost to serve continues to improve over time. We do believe some of those cost improvement items actually translate into top line growth over time as well. And the best example of that is actually in the national accounts business, where WM is completely differentiated itself in the marketplace and therefore, getting outsized growth on the volume line. The other thing that I think is important, and we don't tend to do this, but I want to do a quick comparison our 29.6% margin in the quarter actually compares to our largest competitors at 31.1% because of the impact of the recycling line of business and accretion. And so when we think about how our margins are comparing in the space, we're really proud of the progress we're making. And I think that 31.1% demonstrates the strength of the process improvements that we've been putting in place and the price execution we've had.\nKevin Chiang: That\u2019s great color, and actually very, very helpful. Thanks again and congrats on a good quarter there.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: One moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schumm from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJim Schumm: Hi. Thank you and good morning. You talked a lot about price, but you also mentioned that churn is at historical lows. I mean, why not try and push price a little bit more here? What's the - I mean I know you can lose some business, but given that churn is low, why not push price more?\nJohn Morris: It's a good question. I think - listen, we - I mentioned it earlier, we're very focused on customer lifetime value. And when you look at the defection rate, coming down. Those are some of our most valuable customers. And I think you're seeing that show up across our customer metrics and in the margin expansion. And as we've talked about a few times, I mean, getting price for price is one thing, but getting it over our cost of inflation and been able to grow the business. And Devina mentioned our national account business being a great example, where we've differentiated shown value and continue to grow the top line there. So.\nDevina Rankin: On the disposal side of the business, I think it's important to really emphasize some recent success the third quarter was the best ever disposal core price that we've had in our business. And we're pricing new business up 9% on a year-over-year basis in the disposal part of our business. I think it indicates the strength that we're having there. And pricing has typically in this business been on the collection side. And what you're seeing is we're taking that discipline and customer lifetime value approach and extending it all the way through our value chain.\nJohn Morris: The last point I'd make on that is a line of business, which is that we've been very focused on in terms of pushing price to get the right margin as residential and core price of 6.9% yield to 6.3%. I think as an example of where we are absolutely pushing price.\nJim Fish: But I don't John - its transfer stations. I mean for many, many years, Jim, we never even took a price increase. I mean transfer station pricing was 0.5%. And if you look at our transfer stations pricing, which really is kind of a proxy for landfill, I mean they're - for all intent purposes, they're kind of close in landfills, if you want to think about it in that way. And our transfer stations pricing and the yield number for transfer was 7.1%. And that is a - honestly, it's kind of close to historical highs. I mean we did have an 8.9% in that line of business in Q1. But other than that, it's close to the highest number on my entire period. It goes all the back to 2017. So not saying we can't continue to push price. We absolutely believe we can. We do have to be conscious of that customer lifetime value that John mentioned.\nJim Schumm: Got it. Thank you very much. Last one for me. So you made about $370 million of share repurchases, but weren't very active on the M&A front. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about M&A versus share repurchases right now?\nJim Fish: Well, yes, let me kind of say this about the M&A market here. First of all, at a time when interest rates are kind of a multi-decade highs and there's a bit of uncertainty about the economic outlook here. I'd rather pay 3 times this $740 million that we've talked a lot about today than get into a process based on kind of rosy forward forecasts and race to the top. And that's kind of what it feels like in some respects in the M&A market today. So it doesn't mean we're not going to be in the M&A market. We will be. And when we're in that market, we're going to very much focus on strong strategic growth opportunities and tuck-in acquisitions. But I just I don't want to get into a competition, particularly based on these kind of future forecasts that may or may not become realistic or achievable. As it compares to the overall capital allocation plan and share repurchase, we've laid out that we had $1.5 billion in authorization. And we've talked about $1.3 billion being the actual number. We look at all kind of aspects of that capital allocation plan. We will continue to evaluate dividends, share repurchase, M&A. Devina has talked about the balance sheet, and she's always done such a great job of keeping that balance sheet in a good place. But most of - if you think about it as M&A dollars, a lot of that has not been technical M&A. It's been these investments that Tara talked a lot about. And those are basically an acquisition that we're paying three times for instead of 12 or 14 times for.\nJim Schumm: Right. Right. Okay. All right. Great. Thank you for the answers. Appreciate it.\nJim Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you and one moment for next question. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Yee from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nStephanie Yee: Hi. Good morning. I was just looking at the average yield guide for 2023. I think the expectation was for it to be over 5.5 percentage points. And based on the trend year-to-date, it seems like there should be a big step-up in the fourth quarter. Is that typical seasonality? Or is there anything abnormal with year-over-year comps in this year, implying a big ramp in average yield in the fourth quarter?\nDevina Rankin: So the way that we're looking at it right now, we actually expect our fourth quarter yield to be pretty well in line with what we produced in Q3 and that would pull the full year to ride at that 5.5% that we had targeted. I would tell you from a conversion of core price to yield perspective, the trend that we saw in Q3, isn't really representative of a long-term trend or revision in the strength that we had seen of converting more of our core price dollars into yield dollars. It's instead mix related and also because of some of the impacts of noise from hurricane Ian that were particularly significant in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 and that's impacting our year-over-year conversions. So, I think the key message here is confidence in our ability to deliver yield for the year of around 5.5%.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. Thank you. That is very helpful. And then if I can just go back to the comment about the futures market for RIN pricing and how you're not necessarily pricing at the spot market $3.40 RIN price. Can you just help educate me a little on? Is there an actively traded futures market for RINs? And is maybe waste management leading that development of the futures market?\nTara Hemmer: I think what's important to note is this is a market - even in the transportation market that has been evolving pretty quickly as more renewable natural gas is coming online, and as EPA is raising the RVO, and also the fact that they set a three-year RVO, which had never happened before. So this is something that historically there hadn't been a robust market where you could trade forward, and that's certainly evolved and something that we're seeing activity in.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. One moment for our last question. And our last question from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much. Earlier in the call, you talked about commercial being encouraging. I was hoping you could add any additional color to that. And I know that you don't want to go too much into 2024, but maybe just give some color on, whether - where you're most optimistic, whether it's commercial, resi, industrial, like recovery in any of roll-off. Anything that you're thinking could be better in 2024 versus 2023? Thanks.\nJim Fish: Are you anyway just referring specifically to volume there?\nToni Kaplan: Yes. Yes.\nJim Fish: Okay. Yes. So I guess specific to commercial and that may be the line of business that we have the most - the highest level of optimism. And it's because our national accounts business, where we really feel like we have a differentiated offering there, whether it's through data and analytics reporting or service itself that business has been growing, and it's been growing fairly significantly over the last three years. So as I look at commercial volume, as we said last quarter, a piece of the commercial volume has been a bit of a swap. So we've traded some of that national account, and we have seen a fairly muted small and medium business performance. And the net of the two on the volume line has been slightly positive. So if you ask me to kind of place a bet on a line of business for maybe where we're the most optimistic in 2024. I'd probably put it on commercial or maybe on the landfill line of business itself. I think you're going to continue to see residential be negative, because we continue to kind of pare down some of that unprofitable work. And we just went through our quarterly reviews with our Vice Presidents last week, and there still is some unprofitable work out there that's going to when the contract comes up, we're either going to bid it up or we're going to lose it intentionally. So I wouldn't expect to see volume in resi get back to flat or positive probably for at least a year and roll off is so dependent on the economy, and we just don't have a great view of what the economy is going to look like. We'll know more in three months. But I'd probably put it on commercial as the one where we're most optimistic.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks very much.\nJim Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And with that, I would now like to turn the conference back over to Jim Fish, President and CEO for closing remarks.\nJim Fish: Okay. Thank you very much. Well, thanks very much for all your questions this morning, really good questions. We appreciate them. We do look forward to talking to you in the interim period and between now and when we report our fourth quarter. And in that period, we have some holidays. So please enjoy your holidays. Thanks so much.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our third quarter results are a testament to our team's ability to deliver on the priorities we set for 2023, including increasing profitability through disciplined pricing and optimizing our cost structure. Against the challenging backdrop, we have remained focused on the things we can control and this diligent focus is evident in our third quarter results. Adjusted operating EBITDA grew by more than 6% and margin expanded 100 basis points to 29.6% when compared to Q3 of 2022. Our strong results in the quarter were powered by our solid waste business. Organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business remains solid and is tracking well against our expectations. Third quarter core price of 6.6% reflects robust price performance across all lines of business. We're also pleased with the resilience of our solid waste volumes as commercial volumes turned mostly positive and special waste growth improved from the second quarter. And what really stands out for this quarter is our success in managing the middle of the P&L. We continue to drive SG&A leverage and we're also gaining momentum on operating cost optimization and efficiency gains. Our long-term focus on using automation and technology to optimize our cost structure is paying off, as we're choosing not to replace certain high turnover difficult-to-fill positions. Since January of 2022, we've leveraged attrition and technology to reduce headcount by 1,650 positions. We continue to be focused on the full opportunity of 5,000 to 7,000 position eliminations through attrition and technology over four to five years, and we're pleased with this progress to date. You'll hear more details about our cost performance from John and Devina. Putting it all together, our focus on price, efficiency and cost control translated into the strong operating leverage we produced in the quarter. Turning to our strategic investments in sustainability growth, the investment proposition for growing our renewable energy and recycling business remains strong and our project execution is tracking well. Our seventh renewable natural gas plant and the third of 20 facilities in our growth program is expected to be in service in January. And we have another four facilities on track for completion in 2024, including two of the largest projects in the portfolio, Fairless in Pennsylvania and Orchard Hills in Illinois. On the recycling front, we've completed technology and automation upgrades at two facilities in the quarter. And we have two more upgrades at a new facility in Nashville slated to begin service by the end of this year. Our automated network continues to drive great results by pushing our labor and processing costs lower, improving throughput and driving enhanced material quality, which benefits the recycling business in any commodity environment. Yet again, in the third quarter, we saw materially lower labor cost per ton at our automated facilities at about 35% below the rest of our recycling network. Our investments in developing the blueprint for a modern recycling facility sets us apart within the communities we serve and are unlocking further growth opportunities. With one quarter remaining in the year, we're well positioned to deliver on the 2023 financial outlook we provided last quarter, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 6% at the midpoint. We continue to expect a margin run rate exiting the year of about 29%, underpinned by 62% operating expenses as a percent of revenue and 9% SG&A as a percent of revenue. We're pleased with our results through the first nine months of the year. Our team is very focused on price discipline and cost optimization to deliver a strong finish to the year and lay the groundwork for further growth in 2024. I want to thank each of our team members for their commitment to our customers and their many contributions to our success. I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Good morning. Yes. So I guess a couple of - you mentioned volume, then you mentioned the EBITDA range. So I'll tackle volume first here, Bryan. When we looked at volume, we were obviously pleased with a couple of things, special waste, as I mentioned, was slightly better. Some of that was rate related, really. But for the most part, volume was as we expected, which was fairly flat. We said at the beginning of the year that volume would be flat. And it's been fairly flat all year. Third quarter was slightly better than the first two quarters. I think the collection volumes have been flat pretty much all year long. It's been a - it's different from one line of business to another. Resi almost really by design has been down probably for a couple of years at roll-off was probably the more disappointing of the lines of business and then commercial might have been the one that was more encouraging. So commercial was up slightly, roll off down and then resi by design. And then within the landfill line of business, not anything really unexpected there other than maybe special waste and maybe C&D a little bit. C&D has a little bit of a mix there. And in particularly when you get to the fourth quarter, C&D is really going to be a difficult comparison because of the hurricane last year. But overall volume, I think is not - it's not going to be a big change when you get into the fourth quarter. And honestly, what you're going to see in 2024, and we'll give, of course, our guidance when we get to the next quarter, but 2024 is going to sound pretty similar to 2023, I think, when it comes to volume. I guess when it comes to the EBITDA range - and we anticipated that there would be a question of, okay, so nice performance on EBITDA. So why not give us a number in the higher end of the range. And I would just tell you, there's going to be a natural level of conservatism here because whether it is - not that we're affected much by geopolitics, but there's a lot going on right now that makes it a little bit hard to see out into beyond a month or two. I think that's why 2024 is still a question for us. How does 2024 look? We're going to wait three months before we really try and put a pin on 2024. But for 2023, we're comfortable with the range. We feel comfortable with the quarter. And to the extent that it ends up where we expect, then we were right to not change it. If it's higher than we expected, then it beat us up at that point. Good morning. Yes. We can both kind of address this, Tyler, right. I think, first of all, it's important to understand, and Tara mentioned it in her first question there that we really would prefer that you anchor on that $740 million. That's the number that truly is to be modeled against. The other numbers, look, there's - because of the movement and we anticipated some movement in capital spending, we anticipate some movement in permitting. We've had a good story on permitting in Canada. I mean so - but we've also had delays on supply chain and hence, the movement around in CapEx from one quarter to another. And so the numbers that we gave were really more of a buildup to that $740 million, not intended to be guidance. So that's, I think, first point. The second point here is that with 40 active projects ongoing, there's - and a lot of movement by the way, both in recycling commodity prices and D3 RIN pricing, natural gas pricing, those businesses are really - it's why we wait to give guidance until February. I know companies give a lot of guidance this time of year. But our preference is to wait and give ourselves a bit more time, particularly in today's in today's climate, where visibility isn't fantastic. You can't look off the bow at a ship and see for 20 miles. Now it's not 10 feet either, but it's not 20 miles. So we're really giving ourselves the benefit of a little bit of extra time before we try and answer that question directly. And I'm not trying to punch your question, but it is just going to be much easier for us, for Tara or Shahid for that whole team for Brent Bell to give a very precise answer in early February than it is today. It's probably worth mentioning here, too, that - I mentioned it in my prepared remarks, the 5,000 to 7,000 positions that would come out through attrition that has to-date and so far, the number I gave was 1,650 positions since January of 2022. To-date, that has mostly been SG&A type positions. The big buckets going forward to get us to that 5% to 7% are mostly OpEx position. So when I think about what's happened today, most of those positions came out of our customer experience department where we've used technology to really automate a lot of that. Our call volume has been down as much as 25%. So those positions that had high turnover, 50%-ish type turnover we just chose to not replace. Going forward, the big buckets where you'll get up to that 5,000 to 7,000 range, the big buckets become recycling automation. Now that is ongoing. I talked about a 35-ish percent reduction in labor cost per tonne. But as Tara mentioned, there's a lot of projects ongoing. We're not even close to even one-third of the way through those. So there's a lot of positions yet to come out in our recycling business. Those largely fall into the OpEx category. Then John mentioned the conversion from rear load to ASL. Some of those have taken place this year, but probably three times as many next year. And then the last bucket, which is probably the most difficult one, and we have talked about it quite a bit, but is route optimization. That involves a lot of technology. It involves a lot of process change, but there's also a lot of payback in that when we get it right. So those buckets are mostly OpEx buckets. The previous buckets in that 1,650 positions were mostly SG&A. Yes Tobey, we talked about yesterday, the single biggest plan, and I mentioned it in my remarks, which is Fairless in Pennsylvania. That is our single biggest plan that we will build in the 20 and to give you some perspective, that plant was originally, originally scheduled for opening in the second quarter, beginning of May. And it's pushed a little bit. And right now, it looks like it's scheduled to open at the end of June. So it's pushed a couple of months. But I think that gives you a good feel for what's happening here. We're not talking about pushing things back 12 to 15 months, they're moving in kind of 60-day - 30- to 60-day increments, but it is having some effect on CapEx, for example, but I think the fact that we've got 40 active recycle and RNG plants in 2024, you'll have quite a few more - you'll have another big chunk in 2025. And then we get to 2026, we're very comfortable with the end number. Good morning Jerry. It helps the future market. Yes. I was just going to say, no, I mean, what you're really hearing here, and it's not just specific to your questions, but to all questions is what we've been saying for several quarters, which is there's a few things that are outside of our control. And we're very focused on those things that are within our control might sound obvious, but it's not going to sound that different when we get to 2024. And while we're not giving specific numbers for 2024, I would tell you that when we get to 2024, pricing is going to continue to be good. We're going to continue to focus, as Devina said and John have said on the middle of the P&L. We feel good about the progress we're making on OpEx. We feel great about the progress we've made on SG&A. It wasn't that long ago that we were talking about getting below 11%. Now we're saying the number is 9%. So - but I think the technology that we've been talking about for probably three years is finally starting to show that it really is going to produce some results. And then there's a bit of a hangover from the pandemic where we - where there were some things that we simply didn't expect that affected turnover that affected supply chain, obviously, inflation all of that, I think we've really, really gotten our hands around and now we're starting, as John mentioned in his detailed prepared remarks, pull units out that have been sitting on the fence that really we've been keeping there as just kind of a cautionary move on our part. So 2024 is going to look, I think, pretty similar. It's going to look fairly flat on volume. It's going to look good on price. We finally will get a little bit of tailwind when it comes to our sustainability businesses because 2023 was tough from that standpoint. And finally, we'll see some year-over-year positive comps on commodity prices. I think in our RNG business, we've talked a lot about RIN pricing. That looks like it's - it could end up being a good positive year-over-year comp, same with natural gas, last year, Q4 was difficult because of the Ukraine spike in natural gas pricing, all of that kind of went away if you look at natural gas pricing in the first quarter. So I think you're going to see a fairly another year where we're saying, here's what we're focused on. We're not going to try and predict what happens with the economy. But those things that we can control, I think, we're doing a pretty darn good job of controlling them. Yes. The number we usually give is about 40% is tied to some type of index. Not necessarily water sewer trash, that's one of the indices, but about 40% is tied to an index. There tends to be a bit of a look back on that, a lag. So to the extent that, that number is climbing, that ends up being a positive for us. It just - it takes a little while to get to that full positive. I think to your first question about where we expect pricing to be good. Look, I think pricing has been pretty consistently good across the board. In years past, particularly probably as far back as five years ago, pricing was pretty good, but it was very focused on one line of business. That has changed over the last few years where we've been good with pricing across the board. But I think the piece that we've all touched on a little bit here today that I'll reiterate is really the net price. It's not something we used to talk about, because there wasn't a whole lot of inflation in the economy. But if I just use Q2 of 2022, because that was kind of the high watermark for inflation, so CPI at 9.5% in Q2 of 2022 and if I look at our core price for collection disposal was 7.5% in Q2 of 2022 and yield was 6.2%. Now we're looking at a CPI in the 4% range. I think 4.1% was the exact number. And our Q3 collection disposal core price was 6.6% and yield is 5%. So we've completely flipped the tables there, where in Q2 of 2022, CPI is 300 or 400 basis points in front of our price. And now we flip the table. So collectively, we're kind of recovering - we're adding margin now, whereas we were five quarters ago seeing margin decline. But overall, I think we're on a nice trajectory with respect to margin growth. And that really is a function of having a more manageable CPI. I know one of the questions that quarter was what's the optimal level of inflation? And my kind of smart answer was, well, it's not 9.5%. I think we're - if I were asked that question today, I'd say we're much closer to an optimal level of inflation, because we're able to recover with our pricing programs across the board. Yes, I hear you. Yes, we got you. Yes. Yes. It's a little bit of the answer I gave previously, which was the spread obviously was working against us five quarters ago when you had inflation approaching 10%. And we just were not able to get to that number on either core price or yield. So we were looking at 7.5% core price, 6.2% yield. And now that relationship has really flipped around. So, you're looking at somewhere in the neighborhood of 4% CPI and declining by the way. And then price, whether it's yield at 5% or core price at 6.6%, we feel pretty comfortable that - by the way, I don't think inflation is going to 1% anytime soon. I think you'll probably see inflation in this range for the foreseeable future. So if that's the case, I'd like to be able to maintain our own price in this position where it's slightly above the inflation rate. And by the way, as John has mentioned, our own inflation is - doesn't track perfectly with CPI. So while we certainly have come down on labor inflation from the 10%, 11%, 12% that we were seeing a year, 1.5 years ago, we're still above that kind of 3% to 4% CPI number. So we need to get price in the 5% to 6% range, which is where I think you'll probably see it going into '24. I think we'll talk about 2024 when we get to February. But if you just look at what the progress we made kind of quarter-by-quarter, first half, second half, it would certainly give us a better exit ratio from an operating perspective and a margin perspective. And then I think Devina commented on that earlier. We still feel we have upside, and we've always talked about 50 to 100 basis points of EBITDA margin expansion. And as Jim mentioned, we've been chasing that a little bit in the last couple of years because of supply chain and inflation and whatnot. It feels like we're in a much better spot coming out of 2023 than we were coming out of 2022. By the way, one thing we really don't talk about much when we talk about this rear load to ASL conversion. We talk about the heads coming out because there's obviously a helper on the back of a rear loader. What we don't talk much about is the pickup in efficiency or productivity because we are - our history, and we've got a long history of making these conversions. We are much more productive on an ASL than we are on a rear loader. So there's, I don't know, John, 20%, 25% pickup in productivity in the resi line of business where you're making those conversions. But I don't John - its transfer stations. I mean for many, many years, Jim, we never even took a price increase. I mean transfer station pricing was 0.5%. And if you look at our transfer stations pricing, which really is kind of a proxy for landfill, I mean they're - for all intent purposes, they're kind of close in landfills, if you want to think about it in that way. And our transfer stations pricing and the yield number for transfer was 7.1%. And that is a - honestly, it's kind of close to historical highs. I mean we did have an 8.9% in that line of business in Q1. But other than that, it's close to the highest number on my entire period. It goes all the back to 2017. So not saying we can't continue to push price. We absolutely believe we can. We do have to be conscious of that customer lifetime value that John mentioned. Well, yes, let me kind of say this about the M&A market here. First of all, at a time when interest rates are kind of a multi-decade highs and there's a bit of uncertainty about the economic outlook here. I'd rather pay 3 times this $740 million that we've talked a lot about today than get into a process based on kind of rosy forward forecasts and race to the top. And that's kind of what it feels like in some respects in the M&A market today. So it doesn't mean we're not going to be in the M&A market. We will be. And when we're in that market, we're going to very much focus on strong strategic growth opportunities and tuck-in acquisitions. But I just I don't want to get into a competition, particularly based on these kind of future forecasts that may or may not become realistic or achievable. As it compares to the overall capital allocation plan and share repurchase, we've laid out that we had $1.5 billion in authorization. And we've talked about $1.3 billion being the actual number. We look at all kind of aspects of that capital allocation plan. We will continue to evaluate dividends, share repurchase, M&A. Devina has talked about the balance sheet, and she's always done such a great job of keeping that balance sheet in a good place. But most of - if you think about it as M&A dollars, a lot of that has not been technical M&A. It's been these investments that Tara talked a lot about. And those are basically an acquisition that we're paying three times for instead of 12 or 14 times for. You bet. Are you anyway just referring specifically to volume there? Okay. Yes. So I guess specific to commercial and that may be the line of business that we have the most - the highest level of optimism. And it's because our national accounts business, where we really feel like we have a differentiated offering there, whether it's through data and analytics reporting or service itself that business has been growing, and it's been growing fairly significantly over the last three years. So as I look at commercial volume, as we said last quarter, a piece of the commercial volume has been a bit of a swap. So we've traded some of that national account, and we have seen a fairly muted small and medium business performance. And the net of the two on the volume line has been slightly positive. So if you ask me to kind of place a bet on a line of business for maybe where we're the most optimistic in 2024. I'd probably put it on commercial or maybe on the landfill line of business itself. I think you're going to continue to see residential be negative, because we continue to kind of pare down some of that unprofitable work. And we just went through our quarterly reviews with our Vice Presidents last week, and there still is some unprofitable work out there that's going to when the contract comes up, we're either going to bid it up or we're going to lose it intentionally. So I wouldn't expect to see volume in resi get back to flat or positive probably for at least a year and roll off is so dependent on the economy, and we just don't have a great view of what the economy is going to look like. We'll know more in three months. But I'd probably put it on commercial as the one where we're most optimistic. You bet. Okay. Thank you very much. Well, thanks very much for all your questions this morning, really good questions. We appreciate them. We do look forward to talking to you in the interim period and between now and when we report our fourth quarter. And in that period, we have some holidays. So please enjoy your holidays. Thanks so much."

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks John, and good morning. Our third quarter results reflect our continued focus on the fundamental value drivers of our business, disciplined revenue growth and cost optimization. Executing on these fundamentals positioned us to deliver WM's best ever operating EBITDA margin in the third quarter at 29.6%. This is a 100 basis point improvement compared to Q3 of 2022 and it can be attributed almost entirely to 70 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business. SG&A leverage provided the remaining expansion. We're pleased with the team's focus on optimizing costs and reducing discretionary spending, which together positioned us to deliver SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue of 9%, showing that this long-term goal is not just achievable, it is largely in hand. While the current quarter result has some benefit from lower current year incentive compensation costs, we see this level of SG&A is sustainable, particularly as revenue grows. While there were a number of other margin impacts in the quarter, mostly related to fuel, energy and commodities, these items basically offset each other, giving us confidence that this quarter's results are based on the steps we are taking to price our services above inflation and to permanently reduce our cost structure. Through the first nine months of 2023, we have expanded operating EBITDA margin by 40 basis points to 28.5%, putting us squarely on track to achieve our full year target of operating EBITDA margin of 28.4% to 28.6%. Our operating performance has translated into robust cash flow from operations. Through the first three quarters of the year, cash flow from operations exceeded $3.3 billion, positioning us to deliver more than $4.5 billion of cash from operations for the year. As we expected, cash flow associated with operating EBITDA growth in 2023 has been largely offset by higher interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments. Despite these known headwinds, our conversion of revenue dollars to cash from operations and operating EBITDA dollars to free cash flow in the base business were both near peak levels in the quarter, demonstrating the sustainable value creation from our diligent focus on optimizing the middle of the P&L and/or capital expenditures. Capital spending in the first nine months of the year totaled almost $1.9 billion with $1.456 billion related to normal course capital and $397 million of spending on sustainability growth projects. We now expect sustainability growth capital spending of about $750 million in 2023. The $150 million decrease from prior expectations is based on a shift in the timing of spending across the next two to three quarters. As a result of this lower anticipated capital spending, 2023 free cash flow is expected to be $150 million above our prior expectations and in the range of $1.825 billion to $1.925 billion. Free cash flow through the first nine months of the year was $1.552 billion, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.949 billion. We're confident in our ability to achieve our full year targeted free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of between $2.575 billion and $2.675 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $855 million to shareholders through dividends and repurchased $990 million of our stock. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.73 times, which is at the midpoint of our target ratio of between 2.5 times and 3 times. 9% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, our pre-tax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was 3.9%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth opportunities. Looking at our full year expectations. Our solid operational performance in the first nine months of the year positions us to achieve the operating EBITDA guidance we provided last quarter of $5.775 billion to $5.875 billion. This strong result will be achieved with continued focus on pricing our services to recover cost inflation differentiating WM's value proposition with customers to maintain and grow the right volumes and optimizing both operating costs and SG&A. We expect full year revenue growth to be modestly below the midpoint of our July 2023 guidance of 3.25% to 4.25%. Most aspects of our revenue outlook remain intact, but we have seen lower revenue than planned in our recycling brokerage businesses. Given the relatively small operating EBITDA impact from the brokerage business, this refreshed revenue outlook does not impact any other component of our guidance. To sum it up, we're pleased with our performance throughout 2023. We firmly believe that leveraging technology and automation to enhance our operations and investing in our sustainability businesses are positioning us for future success. We're grateful for the hard work of the entire WM team. Their dedication to safely serve our customers and communities will ensure we finish the year strong and move into 2024 even stronger. With that, Victor, let's open the line for questions. Hi. Tyler, I'll just add a little bit of color in terms of specific amounts when we look at core price covering cost inflation for the portfolio overall. We talked about in Q3 that getting to a positive 100 basis points, which is fantastic for us to see. As you can appreciate, pricing activities don't link directly to when we see cost inflation. And so when we look at Q1 and Q2, the variance between those two measures was a negative 500 basis points. In Q2, we had improved to negative 250 basis points. So what you see is the continued progress in terms of making sure that on an annual basis, we are seeing those pricing activities cover our cost inflation and when you couple that with the cost optimization efforts that we're putting forth to more efficiently run the business and getting some help from truck deliveries we're really starting to see the math associated with price covering inflation and hopefully getting to a point at some point where we start to see that as a lever for incremental margin expansion as well really take hold in the third quarter. Tyler, I'll take that really quickly. But deferral in 2023 was $350 million in the aggregate from where we started the year. Some of that will roll into 2024, as Tara mentioned, because it really is just kind of a not writing the check in December, but instead writing it in January or February. But then we do expect that some of what we had anticipated as 2024 capital could move into 2025. And so it's difficult to say that we'll just take that $350 million and added on to what we had previously projected for 2024 because we will have some shift from 2024 into 2025. But all in all, those projects, the confidence in them that Tara spoke to, I think, is the most important point. For us, it's making sure that we do the right thing from a working capital management perspective, and pay for this capital when it's placed into service or aligning those two as best we can. Thank you. Yes, that's exactly right. When we look at the levers that have been used to deliver SG&A in the current year, it really is our focus on technology and optimization, particularly with some of the success that we've seen in customer experience and sales. And that customer engagement model is something that we know will continue to create momentum in the years ahead. And the cost discipline as well has been really important. So 9% as a percentage of revenue, we feel like is a new long-term sustainable level of SG&A going forward. Good morning, Jerry. Yes, Jerry, I think it's a great point and John and I have spoken a lot about this. I think one of the best indicators is when you look at the year-over-year increase that we have been seeing in the first half of the year for repair and maintenance costs, that was 14.1% in the first six months of the year. In the third quarter, that was up only 6.9% as the deliveries that we've talked about finally are getting on the road and we're able to get the older assets off the street the team members are having to run much longer than our plans because we hadn't gotten or a lot of trucks for the last 18 months or so. So when we look at sustainable levels of repair and maintenance increase, we think that there's, some good tailwinds coming in the fourth quarter and into early 2024. And when you just look at that 1 metric alone, I think it's a great indication. No. What we're hesitant to say is a decline in spend, because while there are some parts inflation places where we've actually seen costs going backward and that should give us some benefits. There are places where we're just still catching up with regard to making sure that we've got the right assets in the right places to service the customers. We do think in the first half of next year, you could see effectively flatter cost in repair and maintenance. And that's what we're working towards. Yes. The way that we've looked at the 29% is basically the second half of 2023. Our target was to deliver 29% EBITDA margin. What you see is a 29.6% in the third quarter that modestly outpaced our expectations for the quarter. So it gives us some room in terms of our fourth quarter expectations. But Q4, you can expect us to be in the range of the 28.5% to 29% margin. Sure. So collection and disposal of 70 basis points plus SG&A of 20 basis points basically tells the story, but then we've got puts and takes and the biggest piece there is the timing of the alternative fuel tax credit and that was a headwind of 50 basis points. That was almost entirely offset by the impact of lower fuel prices and our surcharge structure, and that was a 40 basis point impact in the quarter. Then you had recycling and renewable energy, recycling was positive 20 basis points renewable energy was negative 20 basis points. So again, those two offset each other. And we've talked all year about having some dilutive impact from M&A because of the type of acquisitions we had on the recycling brokerage side as well as just a typical ramp of getting good solid waste tuck-in acquisitions to WM standards. That impact has lessened in the third quarter relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year, and that was at about 40 basis points in the first half down to about 20 basis in the third quarter. And then on the floating rate debt, we're at 9% currently. Yes. A quick piece of color on the 9% just in July, we went into the markets and secured really strong fixed rate debt on a long-term basis at a coupon of 4.875%. And so when you see the 10-year treasury where it is today, you can certainly say that we're really pleased with that timing. Yes. I think it's a great question. I think what's most important is that while we compete in the marketplace, we also compete with ourselves and working to continuously improve our business. And so price is one element of how we grow our business and another part of how we grow our business is ensuring that our cost to serve continues to improve over time. We do believe some of those cost improvement items actually translate into top line growth over time as well. And the best example of that is actually in the national accounts business, where WM is completely differentiated itself in the marketplace and therefore, getting outsized growth on the volume line. The other thing that I think is important, and we don't tend to do this, but I want to do a quick comparison our 29.6% margin in the quarter actually compares to our largest competitors at 31.1% because of the impact of the recycling line of business and accretion. And so when we think about how our margins are comparing in the space, we're really proud of the progress we're making. And I think that 31.1% demonstrates the strength of the process improvements that we've been putting in place and the price execution we've had. Thank you. On the disposal side of the business, I think it's important to really emphasize some recent success the third quarter was the best ever disposal core price that we've had in our business. And we're pricing new business up 9% on a year-over-year basis in the disposal part of our business. I think it indicates the strength that we're having there. And pricing has typically in this business been on the collection side. And what you're seeing is we're taking that discipline and customer lifetime value approach and extending it all the way through our value chain. So the way that we're looking at it right now, we actually expect our fourth quarter yield to be pretty well in line with what we produced in Q3 and that would pull the full year to ride at that 5.5% that we had targeted. I would tell you from a conversion of core price to yield perspective, the trend that we saw in Q3, isn't really representative of a long-term trend or revision in the strength that we had seen of converting more of our core price dollars into yield dollars. It's instead mix related and also because of some of the impacts of noise from hurricane Ian that were particularly significant in Q3 and Q4 of 2022 and that's impacting our year-over-year conversions. So, I think the key message here is confidence in our ability to deliver yield for the year of around 5.5%."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. I'd like to open by highlighting the strides we're making in optimizing our cost structure. In the third quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 90 basis points year-over-year to 61.3%. The collection and disposal business contributed 70 basis points of this improvement due to the strong operating leverage provided by our cost optimization efforts. In addition, we achieved pricing leverage as core price exceeded cost inflation by an estimated 100 basis points in the quarter. We're pleased with the progress we've made in managing our labor costs, as well as expenses related to repair and maintenance. Our efforts have resulted in a meaningful decline in WM's underlying cost of inflation since the beginning of the year to mid-single-digits in the third quarter. Our focus on efficiently managing labor expenses is yielding positive results. So far this year, we have automated 141 residential routes and have a target to convert more than 400 routes in 2024. As we shift to more automated routes, we've seen a nearly 14% decrease in the number of helpers needed in our residential business. In addition, our focus on reducing turnover continued to produce improvements in Q3, building on the consistent progress we've made over the past 12 months. Our collection efficiency has also exhibited steady progress throughout the year with commercial, industrial, and residential business line showing improvements every quarter. All these focus areas on managing our business are contributing to the improvement in labor costs. Turning to repair and maintenance expenses. Despite some lingering effects of inflation and the timing of fleet deliveries, we're making progress. For the first time in several years, we expect to get an allotment of vehicles that aligns with our fleet replacement strategy with more than 1,200 received to-date. This has allowed us to remove older trucks from our fleet and also reduce rental truck usage by over 40% since the start of the year. Furthermore, our spending on third-party technicians has been reduced by two-thirds compared to the second half of 2022 and continues to improve. With the progress we've achieved in the third quarter, we believe we've turned the corner on this expense line and are optimistic about ongoing improvements as we close out the year. Turning to our revenue growth. We continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our third quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 5.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. This growth was led by core price of 6.6% with collection and disposal yield of 5%. Our differentiated service offering is generating value with our national account customers as well as commercial customers. We continue to focus on maximizing customer lifetime value and our Q3 churn of 9% remains at the low end of our historical range, demonstrating the positive momentum we are seeing with customers valuing our service offerings. Looking at volumes. Third quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.7% on a workday-adjusted basis. Our landfill business drove most of the volume growth as special waste grew 11.1% on a workday-adjusted basis in the quarter. As a reminder, we do not separate special waste into yield in volume and in Q3, we benefited from several high-priced projects that drove the increase. So, we've highlighted in previous conversations, the timing and pricing of special waste projects is subject to variability due to their discretionary nature. However, our project pipeline remains robust. In addition, Workday adjusted MSW volumes were up 1.7% in the quarter. Our overall collection volumes were down modestly due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from our roll-off business. Yet both revenue and operating EBITDA continue to grow in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth. Net new business and net service increases remained solidly positive and growth in our strategic accounts business, driven by our differentiated offerings, continues to outpace our expectations. Thus, overall collection and disposal organic growth is on pace for the year. With regard to recycling and renewable energy, our third quarter results were in line with our expectations and our recently automated recycling facilities are delivering strong results. As Jim discussed, our sustainability growth projects are tracking well and we're confident that our operating EBITDA expectations for the year remain in the range provided last quarter. In closing, I'd like to express my gratitude to our frontline teams for their dedication to providing safe and dependable service to our customers and communities each day. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. Yes. Good question, Tyler. I would tell you, let me start with wages because that's 1 I've used as a barometer. When you look at where we were beginning of the year Q1, it was double digits. It was 10%, 11%. And when you look sort of right, the big buckets of labor drivers, technicians, have equipment operators. Those numbers are down between 5% and 6% in Q3. So almost half of where they were. So that's part of what we're seeing from inflation moderation. I think on the M&R side, too, maintenance and repairs, part of my prepared remarks is we got 1,200 trucks, and we'll end up with about over 1,300 for the year and we're seeing the same kind of progress in our maintenance and repair expenses. When you look at it in whole dollars or on a percentage basis, we've sort of gone from the mid-teens down to low double digits and now we're in the 6% to 7% range for Q3. So as Devina said, we're not claiming victory there yet. But I think the combination of us getting assets, some moderation in the big buckets, labor being one of them, are what you're seeing translate to the 61.3% in the quarter from an OpEx perspective. On the core price side, I mean, Jim said in his opening comments, it's not really been so much about the core price going through. It's about what are we retaining. And I think when you look at the margin expansion you saw relative to the OpEx. And you heard in my prepared remarks about us making margin and EBITDA improvements in all lines of business. I think that's the end result we're shooting for. So our pricing strategy holistically is working, and I don't think you're going to see any change in that. I think the other benefit, Jerry, is just a little bit more detail than the M&R question, but it's not just M&R. We're also seeing it show up in other parts of the business, in particular, in labor and efficiency, right, because when we're putting newer trucks on the street that obviously benefits in other places just as opposed to maintenance and repairs. And we're seeing that show up in efficiency. Yes. The collective bargaining comment was simply some dollars we spent in preparation for some contracts we had in the Midwest, which thankfully got resolved. But when we have big agreements like that, it's not uncommon for us to spend some money to make sure we're prepared for the worst, so to speak. But in this case, it was a better outcome and those are behind us. And on the labor front, part of my comment earlier was just in the moderation of rate inflation that we've seen from 10%, 11% coming out of last year into the first quarter or two of this year and now being closer to the 5% to 6% range in terms of the rate that labor is going up. And you put that against the backdrop of our pricing strategy, which Jim commented on, we continue - we're seeing a better spread between what's happened with inflation and some of those costs, in this case, specifically labor. And the turnover is still a good story. That was part of my prepared remarks, too, and driver being the biggest. We have about 21,000 drivers in the network and we're continuing to see improvement there down into the low 20s from probably a peak up in the high 20s to close to 30% 18 months ago. Yes. We're actually in pretty good shape. That's an unfortunate situation. But we've talked to our supply chain team between Devina and I and the build slots that we have and the trucks really going into the first half of next year don't look like they're going to be impacted, partly because we take delivery of chassis a lot earlier than we take delivery of the truck because it's another manufacturer that's involved in that. So we're in pretty good shape there. The only thing I would add there, Jim, is when you look at our customer metrics, which is another benchmark and you look at our new business, our lost business, our net new, our churn numbers, our rollbacks, all those KPIs around how that's impacting the customer are still on a good trajectory as well. So to your point, it feels like overall, we're in a good spot. Yes, I think that's a great question. One of the friction points, obviously, of turnover is the experience level, and that does translate to two things. One, it can translate to safety and it could translate to efficiency and we've seen positive momentum since the beginning of the year for each quarter in each line of business. And two of the three lines of business went back positive in the quarter. All three were positive in September. We're seeing the positive efficiency momentum continue into October. So that's probably the best benchmark for us to look at in terms of where that shows up. That's a good number. It's a good question. I think - listen, we - I mentioned it earlier, we're very focused on customer lifetime value. And when you look at the defection rate, coming down. Those are some of our most valuable customers. And I think you're seeing that show up across our customer metrics and in the margin expansion. And as we've talked about a few times, I mean, getting price for price is one thing, but getting it over our cost of inflation and been able to grow the business. And Devina mentioned our national account business being a great example, where we've differentiated shown value and continue to grow the top line there. So. The last point I'd make on that is a line of business, which is that we've been very focused on in terms of pushing price to get the right margin as residential and core price of 6.9% yield to 6.3%. I think as an example of where we are absolutely pushing price."

            "name": "Tara Hemmer",
            "content": "Sure. This is Tara Hemmer, Chief Sustainability Officer. I think there are two key takeaways that we want you to hear from us related to our sustainability-related investments. And the first is our level of confidence in our 2026 EBITDA projections, the $500 million for renewable energy, the $240 million for recycling. We've spent a lot of time really looking at our projects and we're very confident in our ability to deliver those numbers in 2026.  The second thing that is important to note and it's one of the reasons why we have this level of confidence is in 2024, we expect to have about 40 projects under active construction. So that gives you a sense of the momentum that we're building within the platform. If you look at the capital related to some of the shifts, it is related to both recycling and renewable energy. It's not just specific to recycling. So I want to leave you with that. But the important thing to remember is these capital shifts that we see, we see something similar in our traditional business where construction projects really don't know calendar years. And so some of this is about shifting some things from Q4 into Q1 and Q2. And we'll be much further along in our construction process for those 2024 projects. Sure. The biggest issues that we have been seeing we're really in two key categories. The first is on utility interconnects, and we're making progress on utility interconnect for us. That's on the electrical side and then also getting the connectivity to be able to push the gas into the system. And so we've been working hard on making sure that we have those agreements in place. And then the second piece, it's construction related, but I would put it more into the permitting category, and we've made a lot of progress on obtaining many of our permits that are necessary on the RNG side. So from a supply chain perspective, we've done a fantastic job of really making sure that we have built slots on equipment's for both our recycling business and our renewable energy business. So that's less of a risk. Yes. I mean we're still targeting and using that framework that we had in place, really thinking one year out having 70% to 90% of our volume locked up two years out in that 40% range and then three years out, 10% to 30%. I think what we have to be clear about is when we think about that, it is transportation versus voluntary market, but you can also do fixed priced or longer term deals in either market, and we're going to be accessing both of those. If you think about our portfolio for 2024, one thing that's important to note is we had done some deals in the voluntary market. A great example is we did one with a large utility 20-year agreement with pricing that's north of $20 a ton - sorry, $20 per MMBtu, old garbage gallon, I mean, at $20 per MMBtu. So on a blended basis, if you look at 2024, we have roughly 30% today of our volume locked up, and that will, of course, have an impact on pricing. We are tracking very closely the transportation market, and we've been watching what's happening with RINs and the price pop. What's important to note there though is, we don't necessarily access the spot market. We are looking at the spot market but also selling forward. So we want to just caution people about just taking a $3.4 RIN price that RINs are trading at today for future pricing in 2024. Absolutely. Absolutely. Like, we're more positive pricing going forward into the fourth quarter and of course, 2024. So none of it is cut. And yes, the plan is to catch up. As Devina mentioned earlier, it would be spread throughout 2024 and 2025 with some of what was originally in '24 moving to 2025. So the 11.72 is constant. That's a constant conversion rate on the RINs. Correct. We are full steam ahead, as I mentioned, with that about 40 projects under construction in 2024. That will tell you what you need to know there, we're moving forward. Thank you. I think what's important to note is this is a market - even in the transportation market that has been evolving pretty quickly as more renewable natural gas is coming online, and as EPA is raising the RVO, and also the fact that they set a three-year RVO, which had never happened before. So this is something that historically there hadn't been a robust market where you could trade forward, and that's certainly evolved and something that we're seeing activity in."

Now, I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us. Our team continues to advance our 2023 priorities, including increasing the profitability of our business through strong price discipline, and an optimized cost structure. As I said in February 2023, will be year of pricing and cost control. It's a year of continuing to set ourselves up for the long-term by delivering on what we can control. In the second quarter, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points, driven by pricing and the collection and disposal business and diligent SG&A cost control. We deliver this result, despite some things that we can't control, stubborn cost inflation, slower event-driven volumes, and lower than expected renewable energy prices.  Notably, clean-up volumes from Hurricane Ian came in significantly lower than anticipated which had a $9 million operating EBITDA impact in the quarter. We're pleased with our pricing results for the first half of the year as our team is executing well to ensure that our pricing is keeping pace with the pressure from rising costs.  Overall, our volumes are also tracking at or above our expectations. Though the mix of volumes across our businesses is different than we planned.  Event-driven landfill and industrial volumes in the quarter were lower than we anticipated, which we see as a short term moderation in this business. Some customers seem to be taking a more cautious wait and see approach regarding the timing of large jobs, given the economic backdrop. With many anticipated projects moving into 2024. Our pipeline remains strong. So we view this as a temporary shift in project timing.  The impact to our special waste and construction and demolition volumes has been mitigated by strong growth in our strategic accounts business where we continue to differentiate our service offerings. We're overcoming margin pressure from this temporary change in volume mix with continued momentum in pricing, optimization costs and efficiency improvements. And you'll hear more from John and Devina about the success we're having in managing our operating costs and SG&A where we had opportunities ahead. Turning to recycling. We're now expecting a slower-than-planned recovery in recycled commodity prices in the second half outlook. The investments we're making in automating our recycling facilities position us well in any commodity market environment as they drive lower labor cost, processing costs, improved efficiency and enhanced material quality.  In the second quarter, our fully automated recycling facilities delivered differentiated results relative to the rest of the network with 33% lower labor cost per ton and 18% lower total operating cost per ton. During the quarter, we're pleased to have opened a new recycle facility in the Greater Toronto area, and also completed technology and automation upgrades at an existing facility in Arizona. Recycling is a service with strong customer demand and our intentional shift to a fee-for-service business model as well as our high-return technology investments make it a profitable business for WM in any economic environment, with margins now well above our prior commodity cycle lows. On the renewable energy front, we opened our Eco Vista renewable natural gas facility in Arkansas during the quarter, the sixth WM-owned RNG facility and the second of our 20 planned projects in our sustainability growth program. Last month, the EPA announced its three-year renewable fuel standard rule, which provides strong demand and visibility to the market for renewable fuel standard credits, or RINs. This robust demand provides support for our blended average pricing assumption of $26 per MMBtu used to develop our investment strategy and strengthens the case for potential upside. Shifting to our full year outlook. We're updating our 2023 guidance ranges to consider first half results and a slower recovery in commodity prices in the second half of the year. We now expect an adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5.7% to the midpoint of our guidance range, which is still well within the 5% to 7% long-term growth range that we provided in May of 2019. Devina will walk through the key pieces of the outlook in further detail. The WM team continues to step up to the challenges of each day, while at the same time, progressing investments in our business that positions us to further differentiate our industry-leading asset network and capabilities and reduce our cost structure. I want to thank each of our team members for their hard work and dedication.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Pricing remained a bright spot in the second quarter as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our second quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 6%. This growth was led by core price of 6.9% with collection and disposal yield of 5.8%. We have and continue to emphasize the importance of post-collection pricing, and in Q2, we delivered a yield of 7.5% at our transfer stations and 6% for landfill MSW, both improvements in the growth rates from last year. Our team's collective focus continues to be on maximizing customer lifetime value. That focus led to second quarter churn improving to 8.3%. This lower churn has allowed us to convert more core price into yield, driving our full year outlook for collection and disposal yield to increase to more than 5.5%. Looking at volumes. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.2%. As expected, volume growth was weighted to the landfill line of business with modest declines in the collection business. MSW volumes stood out with an increase of almost 4%. As Jim mentioned, some of our event-driven landfill volumes, particularly special waste tons have been tracking below our expectations and below the very strong levels we saw in 2022. Our collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from temporary roll-off. Net new business and net service increases were firmly positive and improved from first quarter 2023 levels, underscoring that commercial conditions remain solid. Though collection volumes are down, both revenue and operating EBITDA grew in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth. For full year, we continue to expect collection and disposal volumes to be flat at the midpoint of our guidance. Turning to operating expenses. We realized benefits from our optimization efforts in the second quarter, leading to 20 basis points of improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to 62.2%. The improvements that we made in Q2 are being partially offset by higher cost due to inflation. While we experienced some impact of lingering inflation into Q2, signs of easing continued as the quarter progressed. The areas experienced the most pressure are labor costs and repair and maintenance costs. There's cause for optimism in both of these categories. Labor costs have continued to moderate during the second quarter, settling in the mid-single-digit range from the double-digit levels that we have seen over the last year.  This improvement can be attributed to better employee retention as evidenced by over 50% fewer driver openings and driver turnover improving 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. We have robust strategies in place to optimize labor efficiency, particularly in our collection line of business, which we expect to further diminish these cost pressures as the year progresses. We are seeing the benefits of these efforts as we progress through the second quarter, with June marking the lowest cost to serve month of the quarter. This is a promising sign as we move through the remainder of the year. As noted, another significant factor impacting our operating cost has been repair and maintenance expenses. The effects of not receiving a full allotment of trucks over the last few years are still being felt. However, the good news is we are now receiving more trucks and it's leading to improved costs. Since the beginning of the year, our maintenance cost per unit have either improved or remained stable across all collection lines of business. Similar to our approach to labor costs, we have comprehensive plans in place to drive continued improvement in our repair and maintenance performance as we progress through the rest of 2023. Our efforts in these two key areas as well as broader operating expense categories give us confidence that we can continue to improve overall operating costs as a percentage of revenue as we progress through 2023. I want to thank the entire WM team for continuing to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I know they're all working hard to deliver strong results through the remainder of this year and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results and guidance and further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. The first half of 2023 and our revised outlook for the full year is best framed as the story with two primary themes. One of executing well on our top priorities to profitably grow our business, and the other of pressure from market factors beyond our control that we are working to ensure we navigate from a position of strength.  Our team's diligent efforts delivered two particularly strong outcomes in the second quarter. First, revenue growth from price and our focus on cost optimization translated into an increase in collection and disposal operating EBITDA of $95 million or 6.2% in the quarter. And second, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue improved by 30 basis points to 9.1%, and this is the best result in our company's history.  Our commitment to managing discretionary spending and investing in automation to reduce our cost of service is paying off. We're seeing strong outcomes from our investment in a customer experience model that leverages technology to communicate with customers in their channel of choice. Customer feedback has been strong, giving us confidence that with these investments we've permanently reduced our SG&A cost structure, and we will continue to drive improved customer satisfaction that will only bolster customer lifetime value from here. Organic growth in the collection and disposal business and our focus on SG&A optimization delivered 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. Operating EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points overall. So you can see that these two things delivered almost all of these strong results. This is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow margin in the back half of the year and into 2024. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was about $2.1 billion. As expected, higher cash interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments more than offset the benefit of operating EBITDA growth in the first half of the year. We expect to see those impacts lessen in the second half of 2023. Capital spending in the first six months of the year totaled almost $1.2 billion, with $963 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $217 [ph 0:14:26] million of spending on sustainability growth projects. As Jim mentioned, we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth program with three new projects coming online so far this year. However, customary construction and permitting delays for certain recycling and renewable energy projects will push about $200 million of our planned 2023 sustainability growth capital into future years. Free cash flow through the first half of the year was $940 million, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.157 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $572 million to shareholders through dividends, and we've repurchased $620 million of our stock. Dividends will total a little more than $1.1 billion this year and we expect to repurchase about $1.25 billion of our shares over the course of the year. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times, which is well within our targeted ratio of between 2.5 and 3 times. About 21% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.8%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth. Turning to our updated 2023 guidance. We now expect revenue growth of between 3.25% and 4.25%. The revision from our initial expectations is entirely related to commodity prices in our recycling and renewable energy businesses and the pace of contributions relative to plan for our recycling acquisitions. The key takeaway here is that core price, yield and volume outlook in our collection and disposal business are intact and even performing slightly ahead of our initial expectations.  We now expect adjusted operating EBITDA to be in the range of $5.775 billion to $5.875 billion, which is a $75 million decrease at the midpoint. About $50 million of the revised outlook relates to our performance in the first half of the year relative to our plan and $20 million relates to a slower recovery in recycled commodity prices in the back half of the year relative to our expectations. The operating EBITDA shortfall in the first half of the year primarily relates to three things: inflationary cost pressure that has taken longer to abate in 2023 than we expected; a softening in event-driven volumes at our landfills, and lower-than-expected commodity prices in our renewable energy business. These are market-driven pressures, giving us confidence that our collective performance on the company's top priorities over the first half of the year delivered the intended outcomes. With the strength of our collection and disposal operations and the success from our SG&A optimization efforts, in 2023, we will again deliver on our target of growing operating EBITDA by 5% to 7% annually. In addition, we expect to expand our operating EBITDA margin 40 to 60 basis points for the year. Both measures demonstrate the resilience of solid waste and the benefits of pricing discipline, focused differentiation and cost optimization to drive long-term growth. In closing, the WM team is delivering well to safely and reliably serve our customers and to optimize our costs. We will deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2023 and position ourselves for continued success on the road ahead. I can't thank our hard-working team members and us for all of their contributions to our success.  With that, Michelle, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nTyler Brown: Hey, good morning. Devina, so lots moving around in the margins, but can you just talk a little bit about that margin walk in more detail, kind of how we bridge that 60 basis points year-over-year. Maybe talk about fuels, commodity, the CNG tax credit to M&A. I know there's quite a bit in there.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, you're right, Tyler, there are a lot of moving pieces. Similar to what we talked about in the first quarter, when you combine recycling and renewable energy prices that had a negative impact to margin of about 30 to 40 basis points, again, the dilutive impact of M&A, this is half recycling and half solid waste was about 40 basis points. And then what we had is an offset from fuel that you didn't see in the first quarter. So we're really pleased that when you look at those two things which are more timing and commodity related and focus on the real substance of the margin expansion that we produced in the quarter, that is two things, and its solid waste and it is SG&A cost optimization.\nTyler Brown: Right. So maybe fuel kind of offset the commodities and M&A. Is that kind of what you're saying?\nDevina Rankin: Exactly.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Perfect. And then I think last quarter, you guys did talk about 4% to 5% unit cost inflation for fiscal '23. I'm just curious if that number still feels about right or if it is coming in a touch higher? And then how should we think about Q3 margins? Will they be up something like 50 to 70 basis points sequentially and then maybe tick down in Q4, just to help us with the modeling?\nJohn Morris: So Tyler, I'll start, and then I'll leave the second part to maybe to Devina. But I would tell you that when I look at probably the best barometer for that inflation question is probably labor. I think the good news, as you heard in my prepared remarks, it continues to moderate. We came down, I think we were right around 6% for the quarter, which is obviously a tad higher than what we had projected in the number that you referenced.  But I think the good news is, is that we continue to see that moderate and it continue to moderate through the quarter as we looked at each of the progressive months as we're anniversarying some of the peak labor increases. The second part would be on the M&R side. And as you heard also in my prepared remarks, the good news is that we're on track to receive about 90% of our trucks this year as opposed to less than half the last few years. So that's another place where we've seen a little bit of persistence in inflation. But as evidenced by my commentary and Devina's, we feel good about the balance of the year and our ability to continue to drive OpEx down.\nDevina Rankin: And on the second part of your question, Tyler, when we look at 28.7% in Q2, we're really confident in our ability to deliver 29% in the back half of the year in EBITDA margin. And the incremental benefit we expect to come from the traditional solid waste side that John just discussed. But what we're really looking at here is long term being able to target 29% that is based on 62% operating expenses as percentage of revenue and 9% SG&A as a percentage of revenue. And we think that that's just when we look at -- when I say long term, that's what we think we can start to produce in 2024 and there's upside potential from there.\nTyler Brown: Excellent. Very good. And then my last one, real quick. So Jim, it sounds like the $740 million of incremental EBITDA from energy recycling is intact. You did mention that the timing may fluctuate, and we did have the $200 million CapEx deferral. So at this point, how much incremental EBITDA are you expecting in '24 from those? If I look back at the Investor Day, it was something like $225 million incremental. Is that still the case? Or has that been pushed out a little bit? Thank you.\nJim Fish: Yes. Thanks, Tyler. Look, as far as the end number for both RNG and recycling, which was $740 million, that -- we're still comfortable with that. The interim year were really designed to kind of give some insight into the buildup of that. We knew things would change, whether it was timing of CapEx, supply chain-related, third-party delays, permitting, things like that. So what we'll do is update that number, the 2024 number when we give guidance to incorporate some of those shifts that have taken place over the last few months.\nTyler Brown: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And one moment for our next question. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. You mentioned that collection and disposal will exceed 5.5% this year. We did see a little bit of a decel in 2Q. Can you just talk about what should cause that to sort of accelerate from this level?\nJohn Morris: Good morning, Toni. I would tell you, I think the one thing I would point to is when you look at the conversion rate between core price and yield, that's where we really have seen an improvement as we looked at the first two quarters of the year. And now we're converting close to 85% of what we're putting through in core price into yield, and that's given us confidence that as we go through the back half of the year, we're going to see something better than the 5.5% we originally guided to.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. I wanted to ask a little bit more on the SG&A optimization. Thanks for calling that out. Just any additional color on what's going on there and how much maybe you have left to do with regard to that?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen really strong traction, particularly in our customer experience part of our back office. And that really underpins the success of our automation and optimization efforts across the business. That's been the most significant driver of the change in SG&A optimization overall. We expect similar things to happen in other parts of our business as well.  And so while we're looking at a 9% SG&A number, Jim and I talk about the fact that either of us, if we had said that we could achieve that when we both started the CFO position, we would have told you that was a really hard thing to achieve. So we're pleased to be at this level. How much more room there is in it, it's still to be determined. But what I think you see here is WM's commitment to continuous improvement, and we're seeing success really motivate our teams to figure out how to leverage the success in other parts of our business.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Thank you. And one moment. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nBryan Burgmeier : Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just following up on Tony's question, so there's a comment in the press release and prepared remarks about exceeding yield growth of 5.5%. So what level of yield growth do you assume at the midpoint of your revenue guidance now? Is it 5.5%? Or is that above 5.5%, any detail you can have on kind of what's baked into the guidance would be great.\nDevina Rankin: Sure. It's specifically 5.6% as we're looking at the midpoint, and that's about a 20 basis point increase from where we started the year.\nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And I appreciate the updated view on the recycled commodity basket. Can you maybe just provide some detail on what the average was during 2Q or maybe where you are in June, July? Just trying to think about how much improvement we need to see in the second half? Thanks. \nJim Fish: Yes, Brian, I'm going to let Tara Hemmer, she's sitting here with us. I'll let her take that for you.\nTara Hemmer: Excellent. So our commodity price for recycling for Q2 was $60. And I think what you have going on in the second half of the year is really a tale of two different commodity types. If you think about our fiber pricing, we're expecting a slow ramp in fiber pricing, and that's really being driven by some mill capacity coming online domestically.  The bigger story really is on the non-fiber pricing and related to plastics, which is a smaller part of our volume, but higher-value commodity. And we've seen prices decline roughly 30% to 55% from May to July. So that's what's driving our recycled commodity price outlook for the second half of the year. And so we're expecting the second half of the year to now be about $60 a ton. So really the same as Q2.\nBryan Burgmeier: Okay, got it. Thanks a lot. I'll now turn it over. \nOperator: Thank you. One moment please. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nMichael Hoffman : Good morning, Jim, Devina, John and Tara. I was in steaming Houston yesterday. I don\u2019t know how you all live there in the summer. So Devina, what was the value of the assumption for a sequential improvement in all things commodity. So not just recycling, recycling RINs, nat gas, electricity in the original $5.9 billion?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So we look at that as a $40 million -- what I would say is we were expecting about an $85 million headwind from commodity price impacts in the recycling and renewable energy businesses. That's now expected to be more like $125 million at the midpoint. So about a $40 million headwind relative to initial expectations, with half of that in the front half of the year, and that's related to the renewable energy businesses.  And really specifically in electricity and nat gas prices specifically. And then on the back half of the year, as Tara just articulated, pressure from recycling commodity prices, particularly plastic being lower than our expectations, which is causing a $20 million decline in the back half of '23.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. I didn't ask that question very well. You all in your prepared comments, I think, are inferring this, I'm trying to piece it out in numbers. If you got a Mulligan and we went back to February, and you were giving guidance and you didn't have any of the sequential improvement, what would have the midpoint have been? I think it's like $5.7 billion, which means you were raising guidance in 2Q because of the strength of garbage.\nJim Fish: No, I think you're right on there, Michael. I mean, I think if we had a crystal ball and said, \"Hey, commodity prices are not going to improve the way we thought they would in the back half of the year.\" If we know that natural gas pricing was going to come down significantly, which we didn't expect that our electricity would come down or even rent pricing would come down in the front half. Obviously, it's improved in June.  But I think if we had known all those things, clearly, we would have given lower guidance than we gave. But still, as I said in my prepared remarks, and we're still coming in at 5.7%, which is in that range of 5% to 7% EBITDA growth. And by the way, when we gave that back in 2019 that assumes average commodity prices. We are 45%, 40% under average commodity prices.  So I walk away from this quarter -- well, initially -- and I'm not going to sit here and tell you I wasn't disappointed when I first looked at the numbers. But then I start looking at what we're controlling and thinking, gosh, normally, when you crush it on SG&A and pricing and margins. Normally, that's a beat and raise. Why are we having the lower and it's all what we've just been talking about. It's all these commodity-based things that are sometimes hard to predict. And we used history to predict, for example, commodity price rebound. It's going to come back. It's just going to be 2024 now.  So I think you're absolutely right. The guidance would have been lower, still would have been within the 5% to 7% range. But I walk away feeling pretty good about things. I might sound crazy today, but I walk away feeling good that we're -- that those things that we're controlling, we're doing a darn good job of it.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. So I'm repeating the obvious, but core recurring collection and disposal is performing as planned or better. That's the conclusion.\nJim Fish: Yes, that's right. I mean actually, I would say, you could argue a little better, right? Devina just talked about SG&A being 9%. I'd tell you, when I was CFO, I mean, I'm sitting there wondering how we get to 12.\nMichael Hoffman: So she's got bragging rights.\nJim Fish: Yes, she is way better at this than I was.\nMichael Hoffman: On special waste, John, are you below a normal baseline as well. So this is not only -- you didn't get hurricanes, but the normal sort of recurring stuff that happens over and over again, even though it's not terribly predictable, there's a certain baseline. Are you below the baseline too, because of deferrals?\nJohn Morris: So two things, Michael. First, the answer is I don't think no, we're not. I would tell you that on the hurricane piece, I mean, when we look back, that was a little bit of a headwind in the first half of the year, a little bit more in Q2. But again, when we were predicting what we're going to do back last year with respect to Ian, we've cleaned up a lot of it. It just moderated a little bit more in the first half and a little bit more in the second half. So that's answer number one.  I think on the special waste side, I've done a little bit of a lot of homework on this and talk to the team here. I would tell you, no, I don't think we're below the baseline. I think what we saw is historic highs in the first two quarters of last year in special waste, and I'm going back until 2017, I think, is as long -- those are two of the strongest quarters we've had. In fact, Q2, I think, was our strongest quarter in recent history for special waste, so no. And really, it was a handful of events, a little bit in the Rust Belt, we saw a little bit of moderation on some really big projects. But when you look outside of that, I'm pretty confident about what's going on in special waste.\nJim Fish: Well, I think, Michael, it probably makes sense that I mentioned that these -- a lot of these companies went into somewhat of a holding pattern here until they get better visibility on the economy. And when you think about what was going on was potential for a real banking crisis here. So today, they put a little bit of a lock on the checkbook with some of these projects, which they have timing discretion on. They will do those projects.  The pipeline is still strong. We've been talking about that for several quarters. Still strong pipeline, still really good customers that are all still there, but they just put a lockdown on some of these projects. And so down -- look, down 1.9 million year-over-year tons in special waste and RGC for the first half and down very significantly versus our budget, that mattered.  But again, the good news is all these things that were kind of out of our control. They will reappear. It's not as if they're not going to do those projects. They will do them. It's not as if commodity prices won't come back. They will. So that's why I'm walking out of here feeling better about this than you might think.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then Tara, how does the delay -- and you may have answered this, but so much information was given I missed it. How was the delay in spending impact capturing the ITC since such time sensitive?\nTara Hemmer: It doesn't impact it at all. We're confident that we've done the work that we need to do to ensure that we get the benefit of the ITC.\nMichael Hoffman: And then what is the probability that you can work it up from 30% to 50% based on content and all that stuff?\nTara Hemmer: So we're actively looking at which locations can get the energy community benefit, which would take it up to 50% and then also looking at domestic content, which would apply to 17 of the 20. We don't have definitive confirmation there, working closely with Devina's tax team on that, but hope to have some more information perhaps later this year, early next.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. So that's another upside pleasant thing. Instead of spending $1.2 billion, you're going to spend anywhere from $700 million to -- $500 million to $700 million.\nTara Hemmer: What I can tell you is our teams have been working really hard to figure out how we can maximize the benefit across the portfolio. So anywhere where we think we can get the 40% of the 50%, they're doing the work to get there.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Cool. And then, Devina, if you said it, I missed it, what was the impact of less pass-through fees on margins?\nDevina Rankin: So on the fuel surcharge, the impact was about 60 basis points.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then what are the chances we might get segment reporting with more details just this is a learned experience from what happened this quarter?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, absolutely. So what I think is important is you hear the close coordination that's happening between Tara's team and my team on every aspect of growing this portfolio. And I would say the systems, processes, financial reporting associated with the business is something that we're bolstering at the same time that we're building out the asset network. And so we have expectations that we'll be able to build SEC quality level of financial information in the near term, and that's our goal, and we'll keep working towards it over the course of the rest of this year.\nMichael Hoffman: Terrific. Thank you so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nNoah Kaye: Thanks so much. I'll pick it up there on the sustainability investments. And to be clear, permitting delays are absolutely nothing new in the RNG industry, and I think we understand why. But I'd be curious for your color on the development environment, to what extent any incremental challenges are presenting either from a permitting or construction perspective? How sort of temporary do you view this in this growing industry?\nTara Hemmer: Well, I think it's important to set some context here. We have a large number of projects in flight at the same time, and we're really portfolio base view. If you think about it, some of them are going to delay. Some of them were working to accelerate. If you think about what's happening in 2024, we'll have well over 10 projects under construction. And so we're working with utilities to figure out how we can advance our interconnects we're working with local permitting agencies to ensure that we get building permits. So a lot of this is, like you said, really normal course. Things that happen on large construction programs and projects, and we're going to continue to evaluate. And that's why later this year, really when we announced Q4, we'll give a bit more color on what the impact will be.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. And just a follow-up around the RIN assumptions for the full year. Obviously, for the first half of the year south of the original guide, kind of low 2s, RINs being north of $3 now. Is there some sort of impact to the blended average for the year from hedging? If so, can we kind of tease that out? Or could there still possibly be a little bit of upside from where RINs are penciling out today?\nTara Hemmer: That's exactly the right way to look at it. So it really is a tale of two halves. And if you think about the second half of the year, with RIN prices now at around $3. You have to remember that we've been selling ratably over the course of the year. So we had some of our volume locked in for the second half of the year. But on a blended average basis, we expect the second half of the year to be more like 270.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Super helpful. And then I guess a question for perhaps Jim and John. If you look at the disparity in volumes between MSW and the collection lines, I mean, what is the story that tells? Obviously, you went to some of the detail earlier on special waste around to tough comps in some of the pocketbook deferrals. But just looking at that disparity, help us make sense of it. \nJim Fish: Well, it's a little bit hard to tell what is causing the disparity. I mean I think there's a number of different factors. You might look at even kind of the commercial real estate market in downtowns, we -- those have declined a bit because the work-from-home movement has taken hold and kind of held there since COVID.  If you look at MSW, MSW volumes were quite good, but what may be more encouraging is that MSW price was very good. I mean forever we talked about the fact that we weren't able to get price on MSW, and MSW price is sequentially up, it's up significantly year-over-year. So while we're getting MSW volume, we're also getting MSW price, and that is very encouraging for us. I'm not overly concerned with roll-off volume being down. Some of it is related to the special waste projects. Commercial volume is kind of what we expected, kind of flattish, maybe a little bit down. And then RESI is a bit by design. I mean we've lost a few contracts, but that was because we weren't willing to go where they wanted us to go in order to retain them.  So I think we're -- from a volume standpoint, we're basically where we expected. It's just that there was a bit of a shift, especially as you thought more about our national accounts business. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, but that business is doing very well. We're truly differentiating ourselves there and hence, the pickup in national accounts, but it does come at a different margin than, for example, the special waste business that we've talked about. \nJohn Morris: The only thing I would add on the front main residential well. And if you look at residential, and you saw it in the back, if you look at the 4% volume versus the revenue improvement, we've seen a similar trend there last couple of quarters, we try and rightsize that business and continue to get those margins up.  On the commercial side, I did go back and looked at what printed in terms of the volume. And then you net out some of the franchise impact in addition to one national account loss we talked about that we're actually anniversarying ironically. And at the same time, putting about 15,000 containers back on the street to take that business back, we actually end up about 0.2% positive for the quarter. So there's some noise in there, and that's for the level of granularity, but I think that's why you hear from Jim and I some confidence in our answer to you.\nNoah Kaye: We appreciate that granularity. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nSean Eastman : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to come back to the confidence in that core 5% to 7% EBITDA growth going into next year. I wondered that just in light of the great pricing story, good signs on inflation from an OpEx trend perspective, more opportunity on the SG&A cost optimization. Is that a conservative range going into next year in light of how the model is setting up over the next 12, 24 months in your view?\nJim Fish: I guess based on this quarter, I wouldn't say it was conservative. I don't know. Look, I think...\nSean Eastman: Well, you said this quarter was the commodities, right? So I'm thinking about.\nJim Fish: I know. I'm kind of half kidding here. But look, I think the 5% to 7% that we gave in '19 is a good range. But those components that you talked about, we're feeling very confident in those. I mean, SG&A we've talked about pricing has been a very good story for us and continues to be a good story for us. OpEx, John talked a lot about OpEx today. And while we had maybe a little more stubborn inflation in the front half, we're starting to see some moderation, as you said. We're starting to see things like training hours come down. We're starting to see over time come down a bit. So we're getting efficiency improvements, cost per unit on maintenance, truck deliveries.  All of those things caused us to be fairly optimistic, and Devina mentioned 29% margins as a decent jumping off point. And look, I would say, yes, that -- we've talked about 30% being a number that we felt was achievable for probably the last couple of years. Now we're finally getting to a point where we say, okay, we really do believe that. I mean, we're looking at 60 basis points of improvement in margins in the face of some really strong headwinds that were a bit out of our control. So we'll give you a lot more detail on that as we give guidance. But I would tell you that barring a big downturn in the economy that 5% to 7% still looks like a very good range for us.\nSean Eastman: Okay. Thanks for that Jim. And it sounds like maybe stay tuned on this, but in terms of the $200 million of sustainability growth CapEx that has slid, I mean, for now, is it a good assumption to layer that into the prior expectation for 2024, just kind of layer that $200 million on top? Or is that not the right way to think about it? Any sort of preliminary thoughts on that would be helpful. \nDevina Rankin: Yes, Sean, I think you're thinking about it the right way. So layering that on top of what we plan for '24 is the best view that we have right now. We'll give more clarity on that when we give '24 guidance. But based on our expectations right now, I think what's important for you all to hear is that the teams are working really hard to accelerate projects where we can because the returns on these are so strong and a three-year payback period means that we want to get these facilities up and running as quickly as possible. So while there are some places where we're seeing delays in deferrals like you said, there are others where we're working to see what we can accelerate. So right now, our best outlook is to layer the $200 million on to the prior outlook for '24.\nSean Eastman: Understood. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nJerry Revich : Good morning, everyone. Jim, Tara, can I ask you your views on the EPA's outlook for landfill gas, really interesting decoupling from other credit classes, so landfill gas really has to ramp up to hit their targets. Based on what you're seeing, do you think the transportation fleet that consumes natural gas was on pace to grow fast enough to absorb those credits? And given the visibility the requirements lay out for your business, how does that impact the potential shadow pipeline beyond the 20 initial projects that we discussed with Analyst Day?\nJim Fish: I'll give a little bit, and then I think I'll let Tara answer the rest of it. I do believe that there is plenty of demand out there. So from that standpoint, I mean, there's been a little bit of discussion I've heard that, well, are you going to kind of run up against a ceiling here in terms of demand. And I think the answer is there's plenty of demand here as we think about the natural gas fleets, for example. I mean our natural gas fleet is about 70% of routed vehicles. So I think, Tara, I'll let you kind of give a bit more detail. But I feel optimistic about the demand side of this.\nTara Hemmer: Yes. And just to add a little bit of color on to that. If you think about what the EPA did by setting a multiyear renewable volume obligation, it did two key things. One is they raise the volume, so that provided a strong demand signal. And two, they provided multiyear certainty. And that's something that obligated parties like refiners were looking for, and so are the producers like WM. So we really feel like there's a strong demand signal from that, and it has a halo effect into the voluntary market. We're seeing a lot more interest in the voluntary market, and we're actively working with our teams to figure what's the right way to transact going forward.\nJerry Revich: And to that point, given the visibility on a multiyear basis, how are you focusing about the pipeline beyond the initial 20 projects as a result? And are we looking at potentially accelerating the next batch of projects beyond these lines?\nTara Hemmer: We absolutely have a pipeline of projects that goes beyond the 20. We haven't yet determined how we're going to approach that pipeline. So we'll provide some more information down the road. But a lot of opportunity when you think about our landfill gas. It's a phenomenal resource and something that we think we can monetize long term.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can we just shift gears, Devina, I just wanted to ask just to make sure I'm on the same page with you. If I'm looking at the second quarter results from a top line standpoint and apply normal seasonality in the 270 D3 RIN and current OCC prices to the back half of the year, I would get towards the high end of your revenue range. So I just want to make sure I'm not missing any headwinds or any differences versus normal seasonality that could drive you towards even the midpoint let alone the low end of the range. Are there any moving pieces that we need to keep in mind?\nDevina Rankin: No, I think that you're looking at it the right way to really give some clarity on our revenue guide relative to where we started. The commodity businesses, we expect to be down $125 million in revenue over the course of the year with a lot of that already in the first half and then about $100 million decline in revenue from the recycling acquisitions relative to expectations. So our expectations for the back half are normal with regard to seasonality impacts. The only thing that you could see is we did start to see hurricane Ian impacting Q4 of 2022 and those will not repeat.\nJerry Revich: Okay. And then can I ask a similar question from margins. Normally, your margins are up 0.5 point 3Q versus 2Q. This year, we're going to have the higher D3 prices and OCC prices as well that could maybe 0.5 point to that? Is that how you're thinking about 3Q versus 2Q or anything else we need to keep in mind in terms of the margin cadence?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So in terms of the margin cadence, what we were looking at going from Q2 to Q3 in '23 is a typical margin expansion, but the offset will be the timing difference on the alternative fuel tax credit from a year ago. As a reminder, that wasn't concluded from a regulatory perspective until Q3. So we took all of that benefit in Q3 of last year. So that's the one thing that will dilute the margin upswing that we traditionally will see.\nJerry Revich: Got it. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question is going to come from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nHans Hoffman : This is Han Hoffman on for Stephanie Moore. I was just wondering if you could comment a bit on pricing just in terms of where you're kind of exceeding relative to kind of your internal expectations. And then just anything you're seeing from a churn standpoint?\nJim Fish: Yes. I think you could -- we would argue that we're probably exceeding almost across the board, which is why we're -- our expectation is slightly higher than our original guidance, both on yield and on core price. But to be a bit more specific about it, and I think I mentioned it earlier, the two places where maybe we're seeing -- we're most pleased would be on the MSW waste stream, which I mentioned it was up sequentially and year-over-year and to a pretty handsome number and then also on residential. Both of those, by the way, in years past, were a bit of a struggle to see good core price or yield. And now we feel good about the fact that not only are they at the absolute, really good numbers, but the trend has been quite good.\nHans Hoffman: Got it. That's helpful. And then could you just maybe comment on the M&A environment just in terms of how valuations look like? And any change in activity level there?\nJim Fish: Sure. I think the valuations have crept up a bit. I mean as you look at a couple of things. One is a lot of these smaller businesses are seeing an uptick in their businesses coming out of COVID. There's also an expectation from some of these businesses that now is the time to sell, whether it's because they don't have succession plans behind them or because of some of the labor pressures that they're anticipating, there's been certainly an uptick in M&A activity.  And I think for us, it's a double-edged sword. We want to make sure we do have a nice pipeline of M&A opportunities. But we don't want to fall into the trap of paying way up for these. And so we'll be patient when it comes to those. I would rather -- as if these are -- the opportunities are going to go away. So all -- I'll sit back and wait as opposed to paying a multiple of 15 times, I'll wait for that to come down to a more reasonable number unless somebody is willing to sell it to me today at a more reasonable number.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. Your line is open, please go ahead.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. I was hoping you could discuss your labor turnover and compensation growth in the second half versus the first half? And then maybe from a longer-term perspective, how does that sort of comp and expense growth interplay with your 5% to 7% EBITDA growth target over the next several years? Do you model it being a little diminishing over that period?\nJohn Morris: So Tobey, I think a couple of things I'll note for you. One, I referenced that labor rates trended at about just over 6% for the quarter. And if you go back a year ago, that was probably 9%, 10% depending on what part of the country you're looking at. So it moderated. We had expected it maybe to moderate a tad more. But I think what you heard from all three of us is that we have good momentum on the OpEx side and in particular on labor.  What's driving that is there a couple of things we've all commented on, which are driver turnover is down 250 basis points. And why is that significant? It takes a lot of the cost friction out from the labor line. And we're seeing it not only in our quality of service and our safety results, but on a labor cost per unit, we're continuing to see that trend down. And then when you think about kind of where we are first half to second half and when Devina added some color on about what kind of the exit margins look like and what the exit OpEx margins look like. You're seeing that momentum build in the second half of the year and helping us build into momentum for 2024.\nDevina Rankin: I'll speak to the 5% to 7% for a moment because I think what's interesting is when you look at 2023 specifically, we're guiding about $325 million of EBITDA growth at the midpoint. That includes a $125 million decline from the sustainability businesses. And so when you adjust that, that's $450 million of growth from the combination of strong execution in the solid waste business and the optimization of SG&A costs. That's over 8% EBITDA growth in our business. And so I think it indicates that, that 5% to 7% outlook does have some upside potential, and we start to see the momentum of the optimization efforts that we are putting forth. And when we see the stabilization in labor, which John just spoke about, it really helps drive that forward even more.\nTobey Sommer: I appreciate that discussion. What kind of rate in underlying comp growth is there taking the turnover, the hiring, training kind of out of the equation?\nJohn Morris: I'm not sure. Could you take one more crack at that?\nTobey Sommer: Yes. So what is your compensation growth for sort of -- maybe you could take a look at your existing employees? Like what's the underlying trend there as opposed to your training and hiring costs?\nJohn Morris: Yes, yes. That's a good question. That 6.1% that I commented was looking at average unit rate per hour. So that is probably the best barometer for what's happening. And that's what I was mentioning last year, that was 9%, 10%, 11%, depending on what part of the world you were looking at. So on an hourly rate, that's where we see the moderation coming down. The growth of that rate has come down almost in half.\nJim Fish: I think this is -- part of this was the emphasis behind looking to take positions out through technology, not take them out but not choose to replace them because there is a concern, and there has been for three or four years now that this labor pool is shrinking particularly on the trade type positions. And John talks a lot about that. But that's why just in '22 and '23, there's 1,500 positions so far that we've chosen not to replace. Most of those, as Devina said, are on the customer experience side, through adding technology, our call volume is down significantly in customer experience.  But there still are a number of those left. We said kind of 5,000 to 7,000 positions. So at the low end of that 5,000 over a period of a couple of years. John has some operating positions to take out as he moves from traditional rear load equipment, for example, to automated side loaders. Obviously, a rear loader has a person on the back. And not only is there an added labor component there, but there's a safety issue, too. It's much more dangerous to be on the back of a truck than to be sitting in the cab operating a joystick.  There are -- we've taken out only 100 of those so far, really having to do more than anything with truck deliveries. But there's another 400 that are geared up and ready to go as soon as those trucks come in. And I think over the next couple of years, you could see something north of 1,000 that we take out, not only do you get a person off the back, but you also get a 25% or 30% pickup in productivity.\nJohn Morris: The one thing I would add, Jim, is we skipped over recycling. I mean if you look at the benefits we're showing in the recycling business in these automated plants and the margin expansion and the labor dependency and ratio reductions, that's a clear place where it's showing up. It takes a little longer to do with over 15,000 plus routes. But in the recycling business, Brent and Tara and team have done a nice job of really demonstrating where automation drives real dollars out of the business.\nJim Fish: But all of these reduce that risk that you're talking about, which is this kind of inflationary risk on labor.\nTobey Sommer: Excellent. I appreciate you being in the recycling comments. Just one brief follow-up on the relate. With respect to the acquisition pipeline and what you're seeing, you kind of gave an anecdote of a really high kind of mid-teens multiple. Is there really that kind of disconnect? Or was that just a single example, but maybe not representative of the pipeline as a whole?\nJim Fish: No, I mean that's -- look, I think what -- I guess my point was, you're starting to see some of these valuations creep up. And so really my primary point was we're going to be disciplined about that. I mean, particularly as you think about these investments we're making in RNG and recycling, I mean, if you put a multiple on that, it's a multiple of three or four compared to a multiple -- anything in double digits seems to not make sense compared to those. So it doesn't mean we're not going to do acquisitions. But I think we're going to be disciplined about how we go about that, particularly when it comes to some of these higher multiples.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Yee with JPMorgan. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nStephanie Yee : Good morning. I wanted to ask about the plastic commodity prices being down. It sounds like on the OCC fiber front, that wasn't so much of a surprise. But if you can just comment on what's driven the decline in the plastic piece? And what your expectations are, not necessarily for this year, but just maybe perhaps for 2024?\nTara Hemmer: Sure. If you look at what's happening with plastics, it really comes down to the virgin price for plastics is low, which is putting pressure on the recycled pricing. But we think long term, if you think about what's happening with brands, they all have commitments to buy recycled content, and we think that will come back, they are going to come back into the market to buy to meet their commitments. So we would expect that we would see a ramp longer term. It's one of the reasons why we're excited about some of our investments that we've made in plastics recycling and advancing those. And it's one of the things that our automated recycling plants do. They help capture more plastic, which will go to those markets longer term.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. Great. And just a question again on kind of the longer-term EBITDA margin expansion potential, the 40 to 60 basis points, I think was mentioned and the 5% to 7% EBITDA growth, is that premised on yields being higher than that 2% level that was presented back in May of 2019, just because average yield is tracking higher than that right now? And it seems like there is momentum behind pricing, generally, both on resi and -- both on the collection and also the post-collection side?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question, Stephanie. I think the way that we're looking at that is not a specific yield number, but instead the spread between our yield and our cost inflation. And what we're really satisfied with is that we've seen flexibility in our pricing programs to be responsive to different cost environments. And so whether the yield in that initial guidance in 2019 was 2% or we're closer to the 5.5% today. What we're focused on is ensuring that we get the right spread from optimizing the business as well as continuing to price to cover cost inflation for long-term growth.\nStephanie Yee: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schumm with TD Cowen. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nJames Schumm: Good morning. And thanks for squeezing me in. So you cited inflation in the sustainability growth program. Is it fair to assume that the total CapEx to achieve the '26 targets will be higher than what you laid out in April? And can you give any indication of what that magnitude might be?\nDevina Rankin: We are expecting that there will be an increase in the overall program, but because of the size of the program and the multiyear nature of executing upon it, we are going to wait to give specific updates with regard to the magnitude of that. It's difficult for us to update this a quarter at a time. And what we look to do is ensure that we give you clarity as we have significant or any meaningful revisions in near-term outlook and the most material one that we have at this point is just the shift of the $200 million from '23 to '24. Everything else is quite inconsequential to the overall outlook at this point.\nJames Schumm: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just lastly for me. You mentioned a couple of the permitting issues and maybe some interconnects. Are you seeing any supply chain issues for equipment or any third-party constraints with like pipeline companies or anything like that?\nTara Hemmer: On the equipment side, we did a good job in particular on the R&D side of making sure that we really procured our longer lead time items and those critical components related to our build. So we feel good about that. One of the things that we've been watching on both sides is really electrical components. And so the team has done a good job of getting out in front of that. Those tend to be a year out lead time like items and then working in close coordination with the pipeline and then electrical interconnect, and those are typically very local in nature and very site specific. So we've seen some issues here and there that we're trying to navigate through. And again, this is a pretty normal course when you think about what we're trying to build and the scale and the size of our portfolio.\nJames Schumm: Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is open, please go ahead. \nKevin Chiang: Thanks for taking my questions here. Maybe just two quick ones for me given -- I appreciate all the detail on this call already. Just to confirm, the ITC expectations that you laid out at the sustainability of Investor Day, the $250 million to $350 million, that's still the right range we should be thinking about just to confirm that number?\nTara Hemmer: Yes. We'll provide greater detail in the future once we have a bit more clarity from the IRS, but we feel confident in those ranges.\nKevin Chiang: Okay. That's helpful. And then you mentioned, I think, churn in the prepared -- not churn, the conversion rate in your prepared remarks from core price -- between core price and yield, 85%, that's obviously tracked nicely here over the past couple of years, if not longer. Just wondering how you think about that conversion rate, as you crush this inflation we've seen, it sounds like you're starting to see a little bit of disinflation or deflation in some of these buckets or these things aren't rising as fast. Do you think that makes smaller players a little bit more competitive, if they're not seeing the same inflation, they become a little bit more competitive on pricing and that conversion rate could slip a little bit? Or do you think you've structurally changed how you think about core price and yield to kind of hold on to that even in an inflation environment that's, let's say, 3%, 4% versus 6%, 7%?\nJohn Morris: Jim said it last quarter or the quarter before, trying to expand margin when inflation is 8%, 9% is not ideal. So as we see inflation tick down and CPI is probably a good example of that. We don't -- we see our ability to grow margin, obviously, get a little bit stronger as inflation comes down. Secondly, CPI, obviously, is tailing off. I look at that two ways, 1 of which is the cost side, which I commented on.  The second piece of it is as you look back on a lot of our index price contracts. We've still got a bit of a tailwind and we talked about that when we gave guidance of about 5.5% conversion rate there. So -- and lastly, I think whether it's been an inflationary environment, high CPI, lower CPI, if you look at our historic pricing strategy, we've priced to get margin on top of operating expenses regardless of what's happened on the CPI side.\nKevin Chiang: That\u2019s helpful. And thank you for the color. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And I would like to turn the conference back over to Jim Fish, President and CEO, for his closing remarks.\nJim Fish: Okay. Thank you so much. And I really appreciate your detailed questions this morning. It helped us to explain why we're feeling good about this quarter coming out. So thank you for those. Thank you all for joining us. Looking forward to talking to you again next quarter.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks, Ed and thank you all for joining us. Our team continues to advance our 2023 priorities, including increasing the profitability of our business through strong price discipline, and an optimized cost structure. As I said in February 2023, will be year of pricing and cost control. It's a year of continuing to set ourselves up for the long-term by delivering on what we can control. In the second quarter, our adjusted operating EBITDA margin expanded 60 basis points, driven by pricing and the collection and disposal business and diligent SG&A cost control. We deliver this result, despite some things that we can't control, stubborn cost inflation, slower event-driven volumes, and lower than expected renewable energy prices.  Notably, clean-up volumes from Hurricane Ian came in significantly lower than anticipated which had a $9 million operating EBITDA impact in the quarter. We're pleased with our pricing results for the first half of the year as our team is executing well to ensure that our pricing is keeping pace with the pressure from rising costs.  Overall, our volumes are also tracking at or above our expectations. Though the mix of volumes across our businesses is different than we planned.  Event-driven landfill and industrial volumes in the quarter were lower than we anticipated, which we see as a short term moderation in this business. Some customers seem to be taking a more cautious wait and see approach regarding the timing of large jobs, given the economic backdrop. With many anticipated projects moving into 2024. Our pipeline remains strong. So we view this as a temporary shift in project timing.  The impact to our special waste and construction and demolition volumes has been mitigated by strong growth in our strategic accounts business where we continue to differentiate our service offerings. We're overcoming margin pressure from this temporary change in volume mix with continued momentum in pricing, optimization costs and efficiency improvements. And you'll hear more from John and Devina about the success we're having in managing our operating costs and SG&A where we had opportunities ahead. Turning to recycling. We're now expecting a slower-than-planned recovery in recycled commodity prices in the second half outlook. The investments we're making in automating our recycling facilities position us well in any commodity market environment as they drive lower labor cost, processing costs, improved efficiency and enhanced material quality.  In the second quarter, our fully automated recycling facilities delivered differentiated results relative to the rest of the network with 33% lower labor cost per ton and 18% lower total operating cost per ton. During the quarter, we're pleased to have opened a new recycle facility in the Greater Toronto area, and also completed technology and automation upgrades at an existing facility in Arizona. Recycling is a service with strong customer demand and our intentional shift to a fee-for-service business model as well as our high-return technology investments make it a profitable business for WM in any economic environment, with margins now well above our prior commodity cycle lows. On the renewable energy front, we opened our Eco Vista renewable natural gas facility in Arkansas during the quarter, the sixth WM-owned RNG facility and the second of our 20 planned projects in our sustainability growth program. Last month, the EPA announced its three-year renewable fuel standard rule, which provides strong demand and visibility to the market for renewable fuel standard credits, or RINs. This robust demand provides support for our blended average pricing assumption of $26 per MMBtu used to develop our investment strategy and strengthens the case for potential upside. Shifting to our full year outlook. We're updating our 2023 guidance ranges to consider first half results and a slower recovery in commodity prices in the second half of the year. We now expect an adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 5.7% to the midpoint of our guidance range, which is still well within the 5% to 7% long-term growth range that we provided in May of 2019. Devina will walk through the key pieces of the outlook in further detail. The WM team continues to step up to the challenges of each day, while at the same time, progressing investments in our business that positions us to further differentiate our industry-leading asset network and capabilities and reduce our cost structure. I want to thank each of our team members for their hard work and dedication.  I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Yes. Thanks, Tyler. Look, as far as the end number for both RNG and recycling, which was $740 million, that -- we're still comfortable with that. The interim year were really designed to kind of give some insight into the buildup of that. We knew things would change, whether it was timing of CapEx, supply chain-related, third-party delays, permitting, things like that. So what we'll do is update that number, the 2024 number when we give guidance to incorporate some of those shifts that have taken place over the last few months. Yes, Brian, I'm going to let Tara Hemmer, she's sitting here with us. I'll let her take that for you. No, I think you're right on there, Michael. I mean, I think if we had a crystal ball and said, \"Hey, commodity prices are not going to improve the way we thought they would in the back half of the year.\" If we know that natural gas pricing was going to come down significantly, which we didn't expect that our electricity would come down or even rent pricing would come down in the front half. Obviously, it's improved in June.  But I think if we had known all those things, clearly, we would have given lower guidance than we gave. But still, as I said in my prepared remarks, and we're still coming in at 5.7%, which is in that range of 5% to 7% EBITDA growth. And by the way, when we gave that back in 2019 that assumes average commodity prices. We are 45%, 40% under average commodity prices.  So I walk away from this quarter -- well, initially -- and I'm not going to sit here and tell you I wasn't disappointed when I first looked at the numbers. But then I start looking at what we're controlling and thinking, gosh, normally, when you crush it on SG&A and pricing and margins. Normally, that's a beat and raise. Why are we having the lower and it's all what we've just been talking about. It's all these commodity-based things that are sometimes hard to predict. And we used history to predict, for example, commodity price rebound. It's going to come back. It's just going to be 2024 now.  So I think you're absolutely right. The guidance would have been lower, still would have been within the 5% to 7% range. But I walk away feeling pretty good about things. I might sound crazy today, but I walk away feeling good that we're -- that those things that we're controlling, we're doing a darn good job of it. Yes, that's right. I mean actually, I would say, you could argue a little better, right? Devina just talked about SG&A being 9%. I'd tell you, when I was CFO, I mean, I'm sitting there wondering how we get to 12. Yes, she is way better at this than I was. Well, I think, Michael, it probably makes sense that I mentioned that these -- a lot of these companies went into somewhat of a holding pattern here until they get better visibility on the economy. And when you think about what was going on was potential for a real banking crisis here. So today, they put a little bit of a lock on the checkbook with some of these projects, which they have timing discretion on. They will do those projects.  The pipeline is still strong. We've been talking about that for several quarters. Still strong pipeline, still really good customers that are all still there, but they just put a lockdown on some of these projects. And so down -- look, down 1.9 million year-over-year tons in special waste and RGC for the first half and down very significantly versus our budget, that mattered.  But again, the good news is all these things that were kind of out of our control. They will reappear. It's not as if they're not going to do those projects. They will do them. It's not as if commodity prices won't come back. They will. So that's why I'm walking out of here feeling better about this than you might think. Well, it's a little bit hard to tell what is causing the disparity. I mean I think there's a number of different factors. You might look at even kind of the commercial real estate market in downtowns, we -- those have declined a bit because the work-from-home movement has taken hold and kind of held there since COVID.  If you look at MSW, MSW volumes were quite good, but what may be more encouraging is that MSW price was very good. I mean forever we talked about the fact that we weren't able to get price on MSW, and MSW price is sequentially up, it's up significantly year-over-year. So while we're getting MSW volume, we're also getting MSW price, and that is very encouraging for us. I'm not overly concerned with roll-off volume being down. Some of it is related to the special waste projects. Commercial volume is kind of what we expected, kind of flattish, maybe a little bit down. And then RESI is a bit by design. I mean we've lost a few contracts, but that was because we weren't willing to go where they wanted us to go in order to retain them.  So I think we're -- from a volume standpoint, we're basically where we expected. It's just that there was a bit of a shift, especially as you thought more about our national accounts business. I mentioned that in my prepared remarks, but that business is doing very well. We're truly differentiating ourselves there and hence, the pickup in national accounts, but it does come at a different margin than, for example, the special waste business that we've talked about. I guess based on this quarter, I wouldn't say it was conservative. I don't know. Look, I think... I know. I'm kind of half kidding here. But look, I think the 5% to 7% that we gave in '19 is a good range. But those components that you talked about, we're feeling very confident in those. I mean, SG&A we've talked about pricing has been a very good story for us and continues to be a good story for us. OpEx, John talked a lot about OpEx today. And while we had maybe a little more stubborn inflation in the front half, we're starting to see some moderation, as you said. We're starting to see things like training hours come down. We're starting to see over time come down a bit. So we're getting efficiency improvements, cost per unit on maintenance, truck deliveries.  All of those things caused us to be fairly optimistic, and Devina mentioned 29% margins as a decent jumping off point. And look, I would say, yes, that -- we've talked about 30% being a number that we felt was achievable for probably the last couple of years. Now we're finally getting to a point where we say, okay, we really do believe that. I mean, we're looking at 60 basis points of improvement in margins in the face of some really strong headwinds that were a bit out of our control. So we'll give you a lot more detail on that as we give guidance. But I would tell you that barring a big downturn in the economy that 5% to 7% still looks like a very good range for us. I'll give a little bit, and then I think I'll let Tara answer the rest of it. I do believe that there is plenty of demand out there. So from that standpoint, I mean, there's been a little bit of discussion I've heard that, well, are you going to kind of run up against a ceiling here in terms of demand. And I think the answer is there's plenty of demand here as we think about the natural gas fleets, for example. I mean our natural gas fleet is about 70% of routed vehicles. So I think, Tara, I'll let you kind of give a bit more detail. But I feel optimistic about the demand side of this. Yes. I think you could -- we would argue that we're probably exceeding almost across the board, which is why we're -- our expectation is slightly higher than our original guidance, both on yield and on core price. But to be a bit more specific about it, and I think I mentioned it earlier, the two places where maybe we're seeing -- we're most pleased would be on the MSW waste stream, which I mentioned it was up sequentially and year-over-year and to a pretty handsome number and then also on residential. Both of those, by the way, in years past, were a bit of a struggle to see good core price or yield. And now we feel good about the fact that not only are they at the absolute, really good numbers, but the trend has been quite good. Sure. I think the valuations have crept up a bit. I mean as you look at a couple of things. One is a lot of these smaller businesses are seeing an uptick in their businesses coming out of COVID. There's also an expectation from some of these businesses that now is the time to sell, whether it's because they don't have succession plans behind them or because of some of the labor pressures that they're anticipating, there's been certainly an uptick in M&A activity.  And I think for us, it's a double-edged sword. We want to make sure we do have a nice pipeline of M&A opportunities. But we don't want to fall into the trap of paying way up for these. And so we'll be patient when it comes to those. I would rather -- as if these are -- the opportunities are going to go away. So all -- I'll sit back and wait as opposed to paying a multiple of 15 times, I'll wait for that to come down to a more reasonable number unless somebody is willing to sell it to me today at a more reasonable number. I think this is -- part of this was the emphasis behind looking to take positions out through technology, not take them out but not choose to replace them because there is a concern, and there has been for three or four years now that this labor pool is shrinking particularly on the trade type positions. And John talks a lot about that. But that's why just in '22 and '23, there's 1,500 positions so far that we've chosen not to replace. Most of those, as Devina said, are on the customer experience side, through adding technology, our call volume is down significantly in customer experience.  But there still are a number of those left. We said kind of 5,000 to 7,000 positions. So at the low end of that 5,000 over a period of a couple of years. John has some operating positions to take out as he moves from traditional rear load equipment, for example, to automated side loaders. Obviously, a rear loader has a person on the back. And not only is there an added labor component there, but there's a safety issue, too. It's much more dangerous to be on the back of a truck than to be sitting in the cab operating a joystick.  There are -- we've taken out only 100 of those so far, really having to do more than anything with truck deliveries. But there's another 400 that are geared up and ready to go as soon as those trucks come in. And I think over the next couple of years, you could see something north of 1,000 that we take out, not only do you get a person off the back, but you also get a 25% or 30% pickup in productivity. But all of these reduce that risk that you're talking about, which is this kind of inflationary risk on labor. No, I mean that's -- look, I think what -- I guess my point was, you're starting to see some of these valuations creep up. And so really my primary point was we're going to be disciplined about that. I mean, particularly as you think about these investments we're making in RNG and recycling, I mean, if you put a multiple on that, it's a multiple of three or four compared to a multiple -- anything in double digits seems to not make sense compared to those. So it doesn't mean we're not going to do acquisitions. But I think we're going to be disciplined about how we go about that, particularly when it comes to some of these higher multiples. Okay. Thank you so much. And I really appreciate your detailed questions this morning. It helped us to explain why we're feeling good about this quarter coming out. So thank you for those. Thank you all for joining us. Looking forward to talking to you again next quarter."

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. The first half of 2023 and our revised outlook for the full year is best framed as the story with two primary themes. One of executing well on our top priorities to profitably grow our business, and the other of pressure from market factors beyond our control that we are working to ensure we navigate from a position of strength.  Our team's diligent efforts delivered two particularly strong outcomes in the second quarter. First, revenue growth from price and our focus on cost optimization translated into an increase in collection and disposal operating EBITDA of $95 million or 6.2% in the quarter. And second, SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue improved by 30 basis points to 9.1%, and this is the best result in our company's history.  Our commitment to managing discretionary spending and investing in automation to reduce our cost of service is paying off. We're seeing strong outcomes from our investment in a customer experience model that leverages technology to communicate with customers in their channel of choice. Customer feedback has been strong, giving us confidence that with these investments we've permanently reduced our SG&A cost structure, and we will continue to drive improved customer satisfaction that will only bolster customer lifetime value from here. Organic growth in the collection and disposal business and our focus on SG&A optimization delivered 50 basis points of operating EBITDA margin expansion in the quarter. Operating EBITDA margin improved 60 basis points overall. So you can see that these two things delivered almost all of these strong results. This is what gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow margin in the back half of the year and into 2024. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations was about $2.1 billion. As expected, higher cash interest, taxes and incentive compensation payments more than offset the benefit of operating EBITDA growth in the first half of the year. We expect to see those impacts lessen in the second half of 2023. Capital spending in the first six months of the year totaled almost $1.2 billion, with $963 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $217 [ph 0:14:26] million of spending on sustainability growth projects. As Jim mentioned, we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth program with three new projects coming online so far this year. However, customary construction and permitting delays for certain recycling and renewable energy projects will push about $200 million of our planned 2023 sustainability growth capital into future years. Free cash flow through the first half of the year was $940 million, and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments was $1.157 billion. Year-to-date, we've returned $572 million to shareholders through dividends, and we've repurchased $620 million of our stock. Dividends will total a little more than $1.1 billion this year and we expect to repurchase about $1.25 billion of our shares over the course of the year. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 2.8 times, which is well within our targeted ratio of between 2.5 and 3 times. About 21% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates, and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.8%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well positioned to fund growth. Turning to our updated 2023 guidance. We now expect revenue growth of between 3.25% and 4.25%. The revision from our initial expectations is entirely related to commodity prices in our recycling and renewable energy businesses and the pace of contributions relative to plan for our recycling acquisitions. The key takeaway here is that core price, yield and volume outlook in our collection and disposal business are intact and even performing slightly ahead of our initial expectations.  We now expect adjusted operating EBITDA to be in the range of $5.775 billion to $5.875 billion, which is a $75 million decrease at the midpoint. About $50 million of the revised outlook relates to our performance in the first half of the year relative to our plan and $20 million relates to a slower recovery in recycled commodity prices in the back half of the year relative to our expectations. The operating EBITDA shortfall in the first half of the year primarily relates to three things: inflationary cost pressure that has taken longer to abate in 2023 than we expected; a softening in event-driven volumes at our landfills, and lower-than-expected commodity prices in our renewable energy business. These are market-driven pressures, giving us confidence that our collective performance on the company's top priorities over the first half of the year delivered the intended outcomes. With the strength of our collection and disposal operations and the success from our SG&A optimization efforts, in 2023, we will again deliver on our target of growing operating EBITDA by 5% to 7% annually. In addition, we expect to expand our operating EBITDA margin 40 to 60 basis points for the year. Both measures demonstrate the resilience of solid waste and the benefits of pricing discipline, focused differentiation and cost optimization to drive long-term growth. In closing, the WM team is delivering well to safely and reliably serve our customers and to optimize our costs. We will deliver another year of strong financial growth in 2023 and position ourselves for continued success on the road ahead. I can't thank our hard-working team members and us for all of their contributions to our success.  With that, Michelle, let's open the line for questions. Yes, you're right, Tyler, there are a lot of moving pieces. Similar to what we talked about in the first quarter, when you combine recycling and renewable energy prices that had a negative impact to margin of about 30 to 40 basis points, again, the dilutive impact of M&A, this is half recycling and half solid waste was about 40 basis points. And then what we had is an offset from fuel that you didn't see in the first quarter. So we're really pleased that when you look at those two things which are more timing and commodity related and focus on the real substance of the margin expansion that we produced in the quarter, that is two things, and its solid waste and it is SG&A cost optimization. Exactly. And on the second part of your question, Tyler, when we look at 28.7% in Q2, we're really confident in our ability to deliver 29% in the back half of the year in EBITDA margin. And the incremental benefit we expect to come from the traditional solid waste side that John just discussed. But what we're really looking at here is long term being able to target 29% that is based on 62% operating expenses as percentage of revenue and 9% SG&A as a percentage of revenue. And we think that that's just when we look at -- when I say long term, that's what we think we can start to produce in 2024 and there's upside potential from there. Sure. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've seen really strong traction, particularly in our customer experience part of our back office. And that really underpins the success of our automation and optimization efforts across the business. That's been the most significant driver of the change in SG&A optimization overall. We expect similar things to happen in other parts of our business as well.  And so while we're looking at a 9% SG&A number, Jim and I talk about the fact that either of us, if we had said that we could achieve that when we both started the CFO position, we would have told you that was a really hard thing to achieve. So we're pleased to be at this level. How much more room there is in it, it's still to be determined. But what I think you see here is WM's commitment to continuous improvement, and we're seeing success really motivate our teams to figure out how to leverage the success in other parts of our business. Sure. It's specifically 5.6% as we're looking at the midpoint, and that's about a 20 basis point increase from where we started the year. Yes. So we look at that as a $40 million -- what I would say is we were expecting about an $85 million headwind from commodity price impacts in the recycling and renewable energy businesses. That's now expected to be more like $125 million at the midpoint. So about a $40 million headwind relative to initial expectations, with half of that in the front half of the year, and that's related to the renewable energy businesses.  And really specifically in electricity and nat gas prices specifically. And then on the back half of the year, as Tara just articulated, pressure from recycling commodity prices, particularly plastic being lower than our expectations, which is causing a $20 million decline in the back half of '23. So on the fuel surcharge, the impact was about 60 basis points. Yes, absolutely. So what I think is important is you hear the close coordination that's happening between Tara's team and my team on every aspect of growing this portfolio. And I would say the systems, processes, financial reporting associated with the business is something that we're bolstering at the same time that we're building out the asset network. And so we have expectations that we'll be able to build SEC quality level of financial information in the near term, and that's our goal, and we'll keep working towards it over the course of the rest of this year. Yes, Sean, I think you're thinking about it the right way. So layering that on top of what we plan for '24 is the best view that we have right now. We'll give more clarity on that when we give '24 guidance. But based on our expectations right now, I think what's important for you all to hear is that the teams are working really hard to accelerate projects where we can because the returns on these are so strong and a three-year payback period means that we want to get these facilities up and running as quickly as possible. So while there are some places where we're seeing delays in deferrals like you said, there are others where we're working to see what we can accelerate. So right now, our best outlook is to layer the $200 million on to the prior outlook for '24. No, I think that you're looking at it the right way to really give some clarity on our revenue guide relative to where we started. The commodity businesses, we expect to be down $125 million in revenue over the course of the year with a lot of that already in the first half and then about $100 million decline in revenue from the recycling acquisitions relative to expectations. So our expectations for the back half are normal with regard to seasonality impacts. The only thing that you could see is we did start to see hurricane Ian impacting Q4 of 2022 and those will not repeat. Sure. So in terms of the margin cadence, what we were looking at going from Q2 to Q3 in '23 is a typical margin expansion, but the offset will be the timing difference on the alternative fuel tax credit from a year ago. As a reminder, that wasn't concluded from a regulatory perspective until Q3. So we took all of that benefit in Q3 of last year. So that's the one thing that will dilute the margin upswing that we traditionally will see. I'll speak to the 5% to 7% for a moment because I think what's interesting is when you look at 2023 specifically, we're guiding about $325 million of EBITDA growth at the midpoint. That includes a $125 million decline from the sustainability businesses. And so when you adjust that, that's $450 million of growth from the combination of strong execution in the solid waste business and the optimization of SG&A costs. That's over 8% EBITDA growth in our business. And so I think it indicates that, that 5% to 7% outlook does have some upside potential, and we start to see the momentum of the optimization efforts that we are putting forth. And when we see the stabilization in labor, which John just spoke about, it really helps drive that forward even more. Yes, it's a great question, Stephanie. I think the way that we're looking at that is not a specific yield number, but instead the spread between our yield and our cost inflation. And what we're really satisfied with is that we've seen flexibility in our pricing programs to be responsive to different cost environments. And so whether the yield in that initial guidance in 2019 was 2% or we're closer to the 5.5% today. What we're focused on is ensuring that we get the right spread from optimizing the business as well as continuing to price to cover cost inflation for long-term growth. We are expecting that there will be an increase in the overall program, but because of the size of the program and the multiyear nature of executing upon it, we are going to wait to give specific updates with regard to the magnitude of that. It's difficult for us to update this a quarter at a time. And what we look to do is ensure that we give you clarity as we have significant or any meaningful revisions in near-term outlook and the most material one that we have at this point is just the shift of the $200 million from '23 to '24. Everything else is quite inconsequential to the overall outlook at this point."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Pricing remained a bright spot in the second quarter as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. Our second quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 6%. This growth was led by core price of 6.9% with collection and disposal yield of 5.8%. We have and continue to emphasize the importance of post-collection pricing, and in Q2, we delivered a yield of 7.5% at our transfer stations and 6% for landfill MSW, both improvements in the growth rates from last year. Our team's collective focus continues to be on maximizing customer lifetime value. That focus led to second quarter churn improving to 8.3%. This lower churn has allowed us to convert more core price into yield, driving our full year outlook for collection and disposal yield to increase to more than 5.5%. Looking at volumes. Second quarter collection and disposal volume grew by 0.2%. As expected, volume growth was weighted to the landfill line of business with modest declines in the collection business. MSW volumes stood out with an increase of almost 4%. As Jim mentioned, some of our event-driven landfill volumes, particularly special waste tons have been tracking below our expectations and below the very strong levels we saw in 2022. Our collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter due to the intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns as well as the impact of lower volumes from temporary roll-off. Net new business and net service increases were firmly positive and improved from first quarter 2023 levels, underscoring that commercial conditions remain solid. Though collection volumes are down, both revenue and operating EBITDA grew in each line of business, demonstrating that we are prioritizing profitable volume growth. For full year, we continue to expect collection and disposal volumes to be flat at the midpoint of our guidance. Turning to operating expenses. We realized benefits from our optimization efforts in the second quarter, leading to 20 basis points of improvement in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to 62.2%. The improvements that we made in Q2 are being partially offset by higher cost due to inflation. While we experienced some impact of lingering inflation into Q2, signs of easing continued as the quarter progressed. The areas experienced the most pressure are labor costs and repair and maintenance costs. There's cause for optimism in both of these categories. Labor costs have continued to moderate during the second quarter, settling in the mid-single-digit range from the double-digit levels that we have seen over the last year.  This improvement can be attributed to better employee retention as evidenced by over 50% fewer driver openings and driver turnover improving 250 basis points compared to the same period in 2022. We have robust strategies in place to optimize labor efficiency, particularly in our collection line of business, which we expect to further diminish these cost pressures as the year progresses. We are seeing the benefits of these efforts as we progress through the second quarter, with June marking the lowest cost to serve month of the quarter. This is a promising sign as we move through the remainder of the year. As noted, another significant factor impacting our operating cost has been repair and maintenance expenses. The effects of not receiving a full allotment of trucks over the last few years are still being felt. However, the good news is we are now receiving more trucks and it's leading to improved costs. Since the beginning of the year, our maintenance cost per unit have either improved or remained stable across all collection lines of business. Similar to our approach to labor costs, we have comprehensive plans in place to drive continued improvement in our repair and maintenance performance as we progress through the rest of 2023. Our efforts in these two key areas as well as broader operating expense categories give us confidence that we can continue to improve overall operating costs as a percentage of revenue as we progress through 2023. I want to thank the entire WM team for continuing to provide safe and reliable service to our customers. I know they're all working hard to deliver strong results through the remainder of this year and beyond. With that, I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results and guidance and further detail. So Tyler, I'll start, and then I'll leave the second part to maybe to Devina. But I would tell you that when I look at probably the best barometer for that inflation question is probably labor. I think the good news, as you heard in my prepared remarks, it continues to moderate. We came down, I think we were right around 6% for the quarter, which is obviously a tad higher than what we had projected in the number that you referenced.  But I think the good news is, is that we continue to see that moderate and it continue to moderate through the quarter as we looked at each of the progressive months as we're anniversarying some of the peak labor increases. The second part would be on the M&R side. And as you heard also in my prepared remarks, the good news is that we're on track to receive about 90% of our trucks this year as opposed to less than half the last few years. So that's another place where we've seen a little bit of persistence in inflation. But as evidenced by my commentary and Devina's, we feel good about the balance of the year and our ability to continue to drive OpEx down. Good morning, Toni. I would tell you, I think the one thing I would point to is when you look at the conversion rate between core price and yield, that's where we really have seen an improvement as we looked at the first two quarters of the year. And now we're converting close to 85% of what we're putting through in core price into yield, and that's given us confidence that as we go through the back half of the year, we're going to see something better than the 5.5% we originally guided to. So two things, Michael. First, the answer is I don't think no, we're not. I would tell you that on the hurricane piece, I mean, when we look back, that was a little bit of a headwind in the first half of the year, a little bit more in Q2. But again, when we were predicting what we're going to do back last year with respect to Ian, we've cleaned up a lot of it. It just moderated a little bit more in the first half and a little bit more in the second half. So that's answer number one.  I think on the special waste side, I've done a little bit of a lot of homework on this and talk to the team here. I would tell you, no, I don't think we're below the baseline. I think what we saw is historic highs in the first two quarters of last year in special waste, and I'm going back until 2017, I think, is as long -- those are two of the strongest quarters we've had. In fact, Q2, I think, was our strongest quarter in recent history for special waste, so no. And really, it was a handful of events, a little bit in the Rust Belt, we saw a little bit of moderation on some really big projects. But when you look outside of that, I'm pretty confident about what's going on in special waste. The only thing I would add on the front main residential well. And if you look at residential, and you saw it in the back, if you look at the 4% volume versus the revenue improvement, we've seen a similar trend there last couple of quarters, we try and rightsize that business and continue to get those margins up.  On the commercial side, I did go back and looked at what printed in terms of the volume. And then you net out some of the franchise impact in addition to one national account loss we talked about that we're actually anniversarying ironically. And at the same time, putting about 15,000 containers back on the street to take that business back, we actually end up about 0.2% positive for the quarter. So there's some noise in there, and that's for the level of granularity, but I think that's why you hear from Jim and I some confidence in our answer to you. So Tobey, I think a couple of things I'll note for you. One, I referenced that labor rates trended at about just over 6% for the quarter. And if you go back a year ago, that was probably 9%, 10% depending on what part of the country you're looking at. So it moderated. We had expected it maybe to moderate a tad more. But I think what you heard from all three of us is that we have good momentum on the OpEx side and in particular on labor.  What's driving that is there a couple of things we've all commented on, which are driver turnover is down 250 basis points. And why is that significant? It takes a lot of the cost friction out from the labor line. And we're seeing it not only in our quality of service and our safety results, but on a labor cost per unit, we're continuing to see that trend down. And then when you think about kind of where we are first half to second half and when Devina added some color on about what kind of the exit margins look like and what the exit OpEx margins look like. You're seeing that momentum build in the second half of the year and helping us build into momentum for 2024. I'm not sure. Could you take one more crack at that? Yes, yes. That's a good question. That 6.1% that I commented was looking at average unit rate per hour. So that is probably the best barometer for what's happening. And that's what I was mentioning last year, that was 9%, 10%, 11%, depending on what part of the world you were looking at. So on an hourly rate, that's where we see the moderation coming down. The growth of that rate has come down almost in half. The one thing I would add, Jim, is we skipped over recycling. I mean if you look at the benefits we're showing in the recycling business in these automated plants and the margin expansion and the labor dependency and ratio reductions, that's a clear place where it's showing up. It takes a little longer to do with over 15,000 plus routes. But in the recycling business, Brent and Tara and team have done a nice job of really demonstrating where automation drives real dollars out of the business. Jim said it last quarter or the quarter before, trying to expand margin when inflation is 8%, 9% is not ideal. So as we see inflation tick down and CPI is probably a good example of that. We don't -- we see our ability to grow margin, obviously, get a little bit stronger as inflation comes down. Secondly, CPI, obviously, is tailing off. I look at that two ways, 1 of which is the cost side, which I commented on.  The second piece of it is as you look back on a lot of our index price contracts. We've still got a bit of a tailwind and we talked about that when we gave guidance of about 5.5% conversion rate there. So -- and lastly, I think whether it's been an inflationary environment, high CPI, lower CPI, if you look at our historic pricing strategy, we've priced to get margin on top of operating expenses regardless of what's happened on the CPI side."

            "name": "Tara Hemmer",
            "content": "Excellent. So our commodity price for recycling for Q2 was $60. And I think what you have going on in the second half of the year is really a tale of two different commodity types. If you think about our fiber pricing, we're expecting a slow ramp in fiber pricing, and that's really being driven by some mill capacity coming online domestically.  The bigger story really is on the non-fiber pricing and related to plastics, which is a smaller part of our volume, but higher-value commodity. And we've seen prices decline roughly 30% to 55% from May to July. So that's what's driving our recycled commodity price outlook for the second half of the year. And so we're expecting the second half of the year to now be about $60 a ton. So really the same as Q2. It doesn't impact it at all. We're confident that we've done the work that we need to do to ensure that we get the benefit of the ITC. So we're actively looking at which locations can get the energy community benefit, which would take it up to 50% and then also looking at domestic content, which would apply to 17 of the 20. We don't have definitive confirmation there, working closely with Devina's tax team on that, but hope to have some more information perhaps later this year, early next. What I can tell you is our teams have been working really hard to figure out how we can maximize the benefit across the portfolio. So anywhere where we think we can get the 40% of the 50%, they're doing the work to get there. Well, I think it's important to set some context here. We have a large number of projects in flight at the same time, and we're really portfolio base view. If you think about it, some of them are going to delay. Some of them were working to accelerate. If you think about what's happening in 2024, we'll have well over 10 projects under construction. And so we're working with utilities to figure out how we can advance our interconnects we're working with local permitting agencies to ensure that we get building permits. So a lot of this is, like you said, really normal course. Things that happen on large construction programs and projects, and we're going to continue to evaluate. And that's why later this year, really when we announced Q4, we'll give a bit more color on what the impact will be. That's exactly the right way to look at it. So it really is a tale of two halves. And if you think about the second half of the year, with RIN prices now at around $3. You have to remember that we've been selling ratably over the course of the year. So we had some of our volume locked in for the second half of the year. But on a blended average basis, we expect the second half of the year to be more like 270. Yes. And just to add a little bit of color on to that. If you think about what the EPA did by setting a multiyear renewable volume obligation, it did two key things. One is they raise the volume, so that provided a strong demand signal. And two, they provided multiyear certainty. And that's something that obligated parties like refiners were looking for, and so are the producers like WM. So we really feel like there's a strong demand signal from that, and it has a halo effect into the voluntary market. We're seeing a lot more interest in the voluntary market, and we're actively working with our teams to figure what's the right way to transact going forward. We absolutely have a pipeline of projects that goes beyond the 20. We haven't yet determined how we're going to approach that pipeline. So we'll provide some more information down the road. But a lot of opportunity when you think about our landfill gas. It's a phenomenal resource and something that we think we can monetize long term. Sure. If you look at what's happening with plastics, it really comes down to the virgin price for plastics is low, which is putting pressure on the recycled pricing. But we think long term, if you think about what's happening with brands, they all have commitments to buy recycled content, and we think that will come back, they are going to come back into the market to buy to meet their commitments. So we would expect that we would see a ramp longer term. It's one of the reasons why we're excited about some of our investments that we've made in plastics recycling and advancing those. And it's one of the things that our automated recycling plants do. They help capture more plastic, which will go to those markets longer term. On the equipment side, we did a good job in particular on the R&D side of making sure that we really procured our longer lead time items and those critical components related to our build. So we feel good about that. One of the things that we've been watching on both sides is really electrical components. And so the team has done a good job of getting out in front of that. Those tend to be a year out lead time like items and then working in close coordination with the pipeline and then electrical interconnect, and those are typically very local in nature and very site specific. So we've seen some issues here and there that we're trying to navigate through. And again, this is a pretty normal course when you think about what we're trying to build and the scale and the size of our portfolio. Yes. We'll provide greater detail in the future once we have a bit more clarity from the IRS, but we feel confident in those ranges."

Now, I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Thanks Ed and thank you all for joining us. We're off to a solid start in 2023 with first quarter results, delivering on our expectations and keeping us on track to achieve our full year guidance. First quarter revenue grew 5% with continued strong organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 7%. We're pleased with these results, particularly when you consider the impact of West Coast weather disruptions on our operations. With that said, our first quarter performance was basically on our budget and our strategic priorities of maintaining strong price discipline, permanently reducing our operating and SG&A cost structure through business optimization, technology and automation and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth are right on track. Executing on these priorities will produce the robust short-term and long-term financial performance that we've projected. As you heard at our Sustainability Investor Day at the beginning of the month, we're very enthusiastic about how the growth in our renewable energy and recycling businesses strengthens WM's compelling investment thesis. We expect the investments that we're making over the next several years to provide meaningful operating EBITDA and free cash flow growth with impressive returns. We remain on track to bring online two new renewable natural gas facilities and seven newly automated material recovery facilities by the end of the year. We're also opening one new MRF in 2023 in the Greater Toronto area, which positions us strongly in the largest growth market in Canada. Even as these important parts of our operations grow our solid waste business will continue to make up the lion's share of our earnings, projected to generate roughly 85% of operating EBITDA in 2026. As a result, our focus on optimizing performance and reducing costs in the solid waste business through technology and automation is critically important and will serve to further separate us from our competition. One excellent example of this is the expansion of our customer self-service capabilities where we've reduced our call center department costs in the first quarter by more than 20% compared to last year, while at the same time maintaining or improving our Net Promoter Scores in the commercial and industrial lines of business. So far in 2023, the WM team continues to deliver strong performance. The investments we're making set us up to further differentiate our industry leading asset network and capabilities. When you combine these strategic positioning -- when you combine this strategic positioning with the essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base and our recurring revenue streams, it provides confidence in our ability to continue to reach our strong financial projections over the long-term. For the remainder of 2023, our outlook remains consistent with the full year guidance provided at the beginning of the year, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7% at the midpoint and between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion, driven by our collection and disposal business. In closing, I want to thank the 49,000 people behind WM's success this quarter and every quarter. Without this team, none of this would be possible. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks Jim and good morning. 2023 has started off as planned and we're pleased to have achieved our first quarter targets. Overall adjusted operating EBITDA grew nearly 4% and operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew 7% in the quarter. One area that exceeded our expectations was pricing as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 7%. This growth was led by core price of 7.4%, which exceeded both last year and our plan for the first quarter. This strong core price translated into collection and disposal yield of 6.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared with Q1 of 2022. We saw strong yield performance across all lines of business and are particularly proud of our post collection yield. We have consistently emphasized the importance of post collection pricing and in Q1, we delivered yield of 8.9% of our transfer stations, and 5.4% for landfill MSW, both increases from last year. In fact, the transfer station yield is a new high for that line of business, which is helping to offset, increasing cost of labor and transportation. Our collective focus continues to be striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. We remain confident that we can achieve our full year pricing expectations for core price of 6.5% to 7% and yield approaching 5.5%. Turning to volumes, first quarter collection and disposal volume grew 0.8%. Landfill volumes led the way with C&D volumes up almost 37% in the quarter, driven by the hurricane cleanup in Florida and MSW volumes increased by almost 3%. Special waste volumes moderated in the quarter due to the timing of event-driven work, but our pipeline remains robust, and we believe that those volumes will provide incremental revenue growth as we progress through Q2 and the balance of the year. Our collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter, driven by intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns. This has led to some non-regrettable volume losses in our residential and commercial business. With profitability improving in each line of business and contract wins with healthy price increases, we're pleased to see our differentiated service and disciplined approach to yield benefits. For the full year, we continue to expect flat overall volumes at the midpoint of our guidance. Turning to operating expenses, which increased 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 63%. I want to frame these results and then talk about the efforts in place to optimize our cost to serve in 2023 and over the long-term. There were two primary contributors to our first quarter results, the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and continued inflationary cost pressure. As a reminder, we closed on about $365 million of acquisitions of solid waste and recycling businesses in the second half of the year. Integration costs and upfront dilutive margins of these acquisitions had about a 35 basis point impact in the quarter. While this impact was a little more than expected, overall, we're very pleased with the progress being made on creating value from these businesses. The remaining impact was due to persistent cost inflation, which was most significant in wages, repair and maintenance and subcontractor costs. The good news is we see signs of easing cost pressures and the steps we are taking to combat higher costs are also showing benefits. Frontline wage increases are now in the mid-single-digit range as compared to the high single to low double-digit increases that we saw in late 2021 and 2022. And we're starting to see truck orders fulfilled, which benefits every aspect of our cost structure because employee engagement is better, downtime on route is minimized, repair costs to reduce, and expensive rentals can be eliminated. Getting trucks delivered will also be key to residential automation. As we move from traditional rear load to automated side loaders, we're taking a helper off the back and getting about a 30% productivity pickup, which equates to lower driver technician and truck capital needs. We talked a lot about the work we're doing to optimize our cost to serve. Investments we are making in our people and processes are also important. We're always working to make WM a great safe place to work and delivering our team members of best-in-class compensation and benefits package. One of the benefits we know that comes from these efforts is improved retention, which then translates into even better customer service and optimized cost structure because our tenured drivers are the safest and most efficient. In the first quarter of 2023, we saw the best driver retention we've seen in two years. This positions us to drive down our training and overtime hours, improve overall efficiency, and most important, see continued improvement in our safety performance. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for the fantastic job they do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a solid start to 2023 and look forward to building on our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks John and good morning. We're pleased to see our robust revenue growth and disciplined focus on cost control translate into solid operating and free cash flow. First quarter cash flow from operations of $1.04 billion is in line with our plan and a strong result, particularly when you consider higher cash interest and incentive compensation payments. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $660 million, with $504 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $156 million of spending on sustainability growth projects. On the capital front, there are two key takeaways. The first is that we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth projects relative to plan. The second is that truck deliveries are improving. At this time last year, we have received less than 50 trucks. This year, we received about 470. While this is certainly better and shows some easing of the significant supply chain constraints from a year ago, we're still waiting for truck deliveries we planned for 2022. These delays impact our team's ability to deliver on residential collection optimization objectives and targeted improvements in our maintenance cost per driver hour. So, while we're encouraged the worst of the recent uncertainty is behind us, we still need to see a more reliable delivery schedule from manufacturers. Our business generated free cash flow of $395 million in the first quarter and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of $551 million, which puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance on this measure of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. Even as we invest in high-return sustainability growth projects within our business, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned $639 million to shareholders during the quarter, paying $289 million in dividends and repurchasing $350 million of our stock. We expect dividends to total about $1.1 billion this year. And with our outlook for strong earnings growth over the remainder of the year in a healthy balance sheet we expect to continue to repurchase our shares fairly ratably over the remainder of the year. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2 times, which is well within our target ratio of between 2.5 and 3 times. About 18% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.7%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well-positioned to fund growth investments. Turning to SG&A, we're pleased with the progress we're making to drive leverage from a more efficient cost structure. In the first quarter, SG&A costs were essentially flat with the same period in the prior year, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 40 basis points to 9.7%. These results demonstrate our success in rationalizing costs and optimizing our sales and customer experience functions. We expect our investments to continue to drive improvement in SG&A costs and put us on a path toward a permanently reduced SG&A cost structure. Our operating EBITDA margin performance for the quarter was generally in line with our expectations. The 40 basis point margin decline year-over-year is due to three things; one, commodity price impacts on our renewable energy and recycling businesses, which created a 50 basis point margin headwind. Two, the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in late 2022, which had about a 40 basis point impact. And three, cost pressure in our collection and just local business from wage inflation and delayed truck deliveries, which we estimate had about a 20 basis point impact. These margin impacts were offset in part by a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A and a 30 basis point benefit from the timing of alternative fuel tax credit. Our disciplined organic revenue growth and focus on optimization and cost control are expected to drive year-over-year margin expansion for the remainder of the year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. In closing, the WM team has delivered a solid start to the year, which sets us up for another year of strong financial growth in 2023. I can't thank our hard-working team members enough for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Tawanda, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. Your line is open.\nBryan Burgmeier: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. EBITDA margins were slight [ph] in 1Q, at least relative to the sell-side, I appreciate all the detail you provided there. You reiterated guidance for the 80 basis points improvement for 2023. So, do you think we see EBITDA margins inflect in 2Q or at least maybe approach flat and they inflect in 3Q? Just a little bit of timing -- a little bit detail about how much about the timing of improvement on margins.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question. We definitely see the lion's share of that contribution of EBITDA margin coming in the third and fourth quarters. We do expect some improvement from what we saw in the first quarter. I want to point out a couple of things that happened in Q1 that we don't see as indicative of the margins that we'll expect for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned on the commodity businesses, that was 50 basis points of the impact in the quarter. We expected our first quarter to be the hardest comp on a year-over-year basis from commodity prices, and so we think most of that impact starts to abate beginning in Q2. But as I said, most of that really comes in Q3 and Q4 when the year-over-year comparisons on commodity prices improve. On the dilutive impact of M&A at 40 basis points, that was about half solid waste and half recycling. And like I said, we're pleased with the traction that we're seeing in each of those businesses on the recycling side because that business is in a development phase. We knew that there would be some upfront costs associated with integrating that business. They just happen to be higher than our expectations. We don't expect that to continue over the remainder of the year. So, that's another thing that gives us confidence. On the solid waste side, we took a really important step that's team member-focused and an investment in our frontline by making the MLK holiday across the entire organization. That emphasizes our focus on people first, but that is a Q1-only event, and that's something else that will abate for the rest of the year. So, those are the things that give us confidence that the Q1 results of 40 basis points will exceed what you see for the remainder of the year. And in fact, we do see some of that coming out in Q2, but Q3 and Q4 is really where you start to see some strong results.\nBryan Burgmeier: Great. Thanks for the extra detail. And last question for me. Maybe just how did the value of the recycled commodities in 1Q compare to your expectations? Can you share what you might be expecting for 2Q? And apologies if I missed this, but are you still looking for a $70 a ton commodity basket for 2023? Thanks and I'll turn it over. Answer\nJim Fish: Yes. Bryan, we are still looking to see $70 for 2023. The trend has been good and it's what we anticipated. So, at the end of Q4, we were at $47. Q1 was at $54, but it got better as you went through the quarter. So, $57 was our average in the month of March. And then as we're getting into April, we're seeing that continue to improve. Couple of things are helping us. The mill capacity that's coming online is helping with demand on the back end. We're also seeing a pretty significant uptick in pricing for plastics, for aluminums and a little bit for OCC. So, we are still sticking with our $70 and feel pretty confident in that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thanks so much. You mentioned in the prepared remarks, getting the additional truck orders fulfilled and that getting more back to normal. How quickly can we see that productivity impact into your results? And could that be upside to the guidance for this year? Or is that already embedded in the guide, that it returns to more of a normal trend?\nJohn Morris: No, So, I think -- listen, we're thrilled that the supply chain and truck deliveries are starting to abate. As Devina mentioned, we almost -- we delivered almost 500 trucks year-to-date versus 50 last year. It takes 30 to 45 days to get those vehicles sort of on the road and get the older vehicles off. So, there's a little bit of a lag. That was considered when we put together our plan for EBITDA and EBITDA margin this year. We went back and took a look before the call. We probably -- if you go back to kind of post-COVID, we're probably lagging 2,000-plus vehicles from what our fleet plan would have been. So, we're going to get a full complement of trucks this year, probably 1,500 to 1,600 is what we think. So, we're going to continue to get those assets in play as quick as we can and drive the benefit. But keep in mind, part of the M&R pressure is that -- it's not just the trucks we didn't get in 2022, it's we caught up in 2021 from 2022, 2022 to 2023, et cetera.\nToni Kaplan: Great. I wanted to just ask my follow-up on the sort of more recent, like April, late March trends. Have you seen those improving? Or has there been any change? Obviously, the banking crisis sort of doesn't impact your business as much as some of the other business services companies. But any heightened recession concerns with your customers? Like any change in conversations that you're having with customers? Thanks.\nJim Fish: So, John can address the cost side and what we're seeing so far. I would tell you that as far as the overall macro economy, we've been looking at it closely because it seems as if every day, somebody comes out with a different projection. Maybe the best indicators for us are things like churn and price rollbacks. Those have been at the historic low end of our ranges and continue to be there. Also looking at some of our volume numbers, especially MSW, MSW was 2.7%. It's around 3% still. So, those are pretty good signs for the overall economy. Now we tend to be kind of at the back end. So, sometimes we don't see the early signs. But everything we're looking at still seems to be okay. It doesn't look like a blowout for sure, but it doesn't look like the bottom is falling out. So, that's encouraging.\nJohn Morris: I think on the cost side, Toni, I addressed the M&R and some of the challenges we have seen here. The good news is we're starting to open up. On the labor front, I said in my prepared comments, we were close to high single, low double digits, and that's moderated back down to mid-single-digits. So, that certainly is a benefit going forward throughout the year. Subcontractors, we're still seeing a little bit of lag there, and it's really more of third-party transporters. But as you saw within our post-collection pricing and more specifically our transfer stations, we continue to address that through the revenue quality of the remote gates at or the transfer station. I think -- when it all comes down to it, I think we talk about automation and optimization. It's really about permanently lowering our operating expense exposure. And that's really, as Jim mentioned, what we're really focused on for the balance of the year.\nToni Kaplan: Fantastic. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi, good morning everyone.\nJim Fish: Good morning.\nJerry Revich: Devina, I'm wondering if you can talk about second quarter. So, normal seasonality is your margins are up about 200 basis points second quarter versus first quarter. And you mentioned a number of one-offs in the first quarter. So, I'm wondering, as you're thinking about the cadence, is there a potential for margins to be up stronger sequentially than the typical two points that we've seen in the past.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question, Jerry. And that's some of the analysis we've been particularly honed in and on and looking at. And that is our expectation, is that the first quarter of 2023 had some margin pressures that we see as more related to 2023 specifically, such that the normal seasonal uptick that we see from a revenue perspective will provide the typical expansion. And then on top of that, we'll have some added benefits from lapping some of the commodity price impacts I've talked about. We're also expecting to see some strong accretive revenue come back in the collection line of business, in particular as our differentiated service model really pays some dividends in terms of our national accounts business where we are going to lap some of the contracts' expirations and we're going to see some contracts return. So, those are the things that give us so much confidence that Q2 really will be outsized relative to a typical year.\nJerry Revich: That's great. So, really you have high visibility on essentially getting to your margin run rate as early as 2Q. Okay. And can I ask on the post-collection pricing momentum that, John, you mentioned in the prepared remarks. How much more momentum is there, I would have presumed a chunk of that is CPI pricing rolling. But can you just expand -- and really nice to see the strong numbers, both in transfer stations and landfills.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Jerry. I would tell you that's something we've been working on, and that's been a tougher hill to climb, obviously, because those are bigger chunks of a volume and big customers when you're making those decisions. I think as I mentioned, the transportation piece, and a lot of that is labor and fuel, if you will, has continued to persist, which is why one of the reasons why you continue to see us be as aggressive as we are on the transfer station side. And on the landfill side, again, the cost of constructing and operating as landfills is not getting cheaper. So, part of our pricing strategy, obviously, a minimum to recover our investment there, but also look for margin improvement where that opportunity exists.\nJim Fish: I think, Jerry, it's also worth mentioning that our team is, over the years -- the last couple of years has really come to appreciate the fact that landfill aerospace is a precious commodity and if you think about particularly the East Coast, that space doesn't come cheaply and it's -- there's a finite life to all of those. So, we need to price it that way. And that's, in large part, what you're seeing out of transportation but also largely landfill pricing.\nJerry Revich: And Jim, just one last one, if I could. SG&A has obviously been a big focus for you, and really strong cost control this quarter. Can you talk about, did we get a full quarter run rate out of the initiatives that you mentioned on the call center side this quarter? Or is that momentum building over the course of the year?\nJim Fish: So, on the call center side, we did not refill about 580 positions last year and there are another 300 that we will choose not to refill this year. So, I would say we're probably -- we were probably 60% of the way there on that piece. But some of those other positions that we've talked about, John mentioned it, which is replacing reloaders with ASOs. And he talked about 30% productivity pick up there. We're not -- because we haven't been receiving the trucks, I mean, you can't make that swap obviously without the truck. There's some work that's involved with our public sector team. They have to talk to our customers and make sure that they're comfortable with going to trash just being in one of those totters [ph] as opposed to everything sitting on the curve. But -- and they've made nice progress there. But as we do that, we think there's another probably up to 2,000 positions that are helpful positions that we just will choose not to refill. And as you can imagine, those have very high turnover, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% for those. So, once those trucks come in, once we've talked to the customer base, we will transition those. And maybe the most important piece that John mentioned is it helps us from a safety standpoint. 70% our injuries happen in the residential line of business. And I would guess that 90% of that 70% are on rear loaders.\nJerry Revich: Very interesting. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James.\nTyler Brown: Hey good morning.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning.\nTyler Brown: Hey Jim, John, just I was looking back through the Q4 transcript, and I'm not really sure I saw it. But can you just kind of remind us what is embedded -- or the level of unit cost inflation that's kind of embedded in the 2023 guide and maybe where are you today?\nDevina Rankin: Sure. In terms of unit cost inflation, we expected in 2023 about 4% to 5% unit cost inflation for the year. And when we look at Q1, it was certainly higher than that. But our expectation is that, that moderates. And as John has talked about, in particular, labor and repair and maintenance are expected to benefit from the actions that we saw early signs of as we looked at February, March, but we expect to continue to gain momentum over the remainder of the year.\nTyler Brown: Right. Okay. So, that kind of naturally slopes down. So, look, Jim, I don't want to get into the comparison game, but one of your competitors showed core pricing accelerated in Q1. It looks like your pricing may be peaked in Q4. I get that there are a variety of factors at play. But I've got a lot of questions this morning. But just any thoughts on the pricing environment, your go-to-market strategy? And do you just feel comfortable that you can maintain a nice positive spread to unit cost inflation both over the short and long-term?\nJim Fish: Yes. Look, I didn't see what their numbers were at. But I would tell you this, first of all, I looked back. Historically, we anticipated the question. And historically, Q1 has been the lowest yield for us over a period of probably a decade. It's almost always been the lowest yield number on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But when I look at how we're doing with things like rollback of price and churn, those are, as I said, near the bottom end of our historic ranges. And I also was very encouraged to see pricing in two particular places that we're encouraging: residential, which John talked about, and landfill and transfer. Those are -- we just talked about it with Jerry, but those were really important areas for us to kind of -- all three of those. When we talk about it probably four years ago, we're talking about something less than 1%. And now we're talking about much higher numbers, albeit in a higher inflation environment. But still, I think you're seeing the discipline there around pricing very strong. So, I don't know really what the other folks reported, but I would tell you, there's no loss of discipline whatsoever. There's really, I think, Tyler, three areas that we're all focused on for 2023, and those are top of line -- at the very top of the list has got to be price, and then a close second to that is what John has been talking about, which is cost control, both SG&A and OpEx and using technology to facilitate that. And then, of course, the third one is when we talked about three weeks ago, which are those sustainability investments. So, those three are really kind of our near-term focus that will help us out in the long-term.\nTyler Brown: Okay, perfect. And then my last one, I got to kind of go back over this margin walk, there's a ton in there. So, make sure I've got it. So, commodities and RINs were a 50 basis point headwind, M&A was about a 40 basis point headwind. You mentioned something -- I think you said 30 basis points from a fuel tax credit. I was unclear, is that a hurt or help. And then you mentioned in higher incentive compensation, I wasn't sure if you were talking cash flow or EBITDA. And then is the holiday addition about a 50 basis point headwind as well as I would assume it's kind of like one less workday?\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So, let me take that in pieces. The alternative fuel tax credit was a help of 30 basis points, and that's a help because of timing. So, you might recall that last year, we got -- there was a delay in the approval of those tax credits by government. And so there was a delay in our recognition of those tax credit benefits until the third quarter of 2022. So, what you're seeing this year is that those are going to be recognized quarter-by-quarter. So, we got the benefit in Q1. We'll have another benefit in Q2 and then that moderates in Q3, reverses itself, and then normalizes beginning in Q4. On the dilutive impact from commodity businesses of 50 basis points, you had that right. Incentive compensation was cash flow. So, yes, that was a cash flow impact. When we gave our guidance for 2023, we talked about working capital being a headwind in the year. And a lot of that headwind, really all of that headwind was in the first quarter as anticipated because higher incentive compensation payments happened in Q1 because of the 2022 outperformance relative to our plan. So, that moderates and really starts to become a tailwind over the remainder of the year. On the solid waste side, when I was mentioning the MLK holiday, that was part of the 20 basis point margin headwind that we saw from the solid waste part of the business. What's really important there, I think, in terms of thinking about what it means for the rest of the year is that, that impact isn't something that repeats itself. It actually doesn't become a help necessarily, but it's not something that we see repeating over the remainder of the year because it was a onetime event.\nJim Fish: And it was not -- there wasn't one less workday. We still had to work those days. It's just we paid everybody time and a half.\nTyler Brown: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Okay, perfect. Super helpful as usual. Thank you so much.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks Tyler.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. Your line is open.\nMichael Hoffman: Hey WM, how is everybody today?\nJim Fish: Good morning Michael.\nDevina Rankin: Hey.\nMichael Hoffman: So, John, what is the trend on service intervals, new business formation, temporary roll-off asset utilization?\nJohn Morris: So, the service interval piece, Michael, is still positive. That's the headline. In addition to the service intervals, though, as Jim mentioned in the commentary a few minutes ago, the other parts of that, that we're really paying close attention to is what the churn rate is doing and what the rollbacks are doing even as we continue to be aggressive on the pricing side. And those have all continued to stay static and in a good spot and service intervals are still positive. So we feel good about that.\nDevina Rankin: From an asset utilization perspective, Michael, I think it's important that as John mentioned, it takes 35 to 40 days to get those new trucks in service and on the road. That means that we've been holding on to some of our older vehicles longer. And so asset utilization, not necessarily where we like it to be. But that's because we've needed to be intentional about keeping our vehicles and maintaining them so that we meet all of our service needs for our customers.\nJohn Morris: So, this is anecdotal, Michael, but we did our business refused with all our areas last week. And one of our areas actually was scheduled to return some rental trucks which, as you can imagine, are done at a premium. And we were told, hey, your trucks are going to be -- and it wasn't a large amount of trucks, less than a dozen trucks. But this area turned their trucks back in and then we got delayed another 30 or 45 days on some of the delivery. So, to Devina's point, there's a little pensiveness by the field, and we understand it's to send those trucks back, whether it's rentals or surplus assets. The good news is, like we said, there's almost 500 trucks that are on the ground, not in service yet. So, when we think about rentals and surplus assets, we have a clear path for the rest of the year and more confidence in the delivery schedule that we're going to be able to take those out.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then just to settle the on temporal losses. I mean, that's sort of a good canary in the coal mine about business activity. What's the temporal loss utilization look like?\nJohn Morris: I don't know, Michael, we've seen a meaningful movement there. I would tell you, we don't talk about weather, but there was a handful of areas on the West Coast where we were shut down for a few days and some kind of really odd weather. But other than that, it's been -- I think the temp story has been a consistent one.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then, Devina, can you share something? I know it historically don't, but I think it helps put in perspective Tyler's question. Your 62 is a good number. But what's the mix of index versus open market? Because I think there's some waiting issue there that people should appreciate given that 70% of your index is happening now and it's a number from last summer, not the end of the calendar year.\nJohn Morris: So, we've said, Michael, about 40% of our revenue is indexed. It's not all CPI as we've talked about. The majority of that, though, really, as we all know, runs through that residential line of business. And that's when you look at the pricing and the yield results in residential, I think for the quarter, we were up $53 million in revenue. We're down about 29 in volume. So, we continue to down that path until we get to some acceptable spot there. And it's noteworthy that the residential line of business, as you can imagine, is one that eats a little more of the inflation, some of the other one due to the labor intensity and whatnot. But if you look at where CPI was last quarter or this quarter, you look at core price and yield, we're still pricing above that. So, we're getting traction even above that CPI number.\nMichael Hoffman: But just to be clear, the part of the drag on the 62 with people are looking sequentially is the number that's in the first half isn't the immediate -- just immediate CPI. It's actually -- well, one from last summer, which would be lower than the CPI that was at the end of the year. That's the subtlety of your model because so much of your business resets in the first half. It's not a negative. It's just everybody needs to understand it.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, you're right, Michael. About 70% of our resets are in the first half of the year, and those are all indexed to a year ago activity. And so we'll see some of that benefit as we go through the rest of the year in terms of where inflation headline numbers continue to be high.\nMichael Hoffman: Right. Okay. And then on the commodity side, the other pieces of your model are RINs in nat gas and electricity. Overall, you have an assumption all this would improve. I have a suspicion maybe you will end up with two lefts and a right versus two rights and a left to get to the same outcome. But do you feel comfortable about the whole mix, not just recycling that all of those things are going to collectively get to the right place relative to the guide?\nJim Fish: I like the way you said that, Michael. I was trying to figure out a good way to say that. You said it better than I would. But you're right. I mean, it's -- in any big business, there's going to be a few things that work in our favor, a few things that work against us. RIN pricing is probably a little bit against us right now. We budgeted $2.30, and it's $2. So, that one may end up being a little bit of a headwind. But we've also gone through some of the tailwinds, too. I mean SG&A, is -- I'm not sure we've ever had an SG&A number as a percent of revenue below 10% for the first quarter because the revenue base is always low for Q1. So, we're doing a better job on SG&A than we actually anticipated. I could say the same thing about MSW volume or a couple of the other things. So, you're right. There's a few things that are coming in a little lower than our expectation. RIN pricing would be one of those. On the other side, recycle pricing, as we talked about a little bit earlier, is right on our expectations. So, we're pleased with that because I know there were a few that had questioned our $70 number, and that looks like it's probably going to hold. So, I think you're right about the fact that there's a whole bunch of pieces in play here.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And then last one for me. One of the things I've noticed that you have all been doing, and maybe it was perpetual, first of all, maybe it was just an outcome, is the gap between what you're getting in yield in collection versus the yield and post collection has been closing. How much more can that close? It's a good thing. Well, how much more can that close?\nJim Fish: I think it will continue to close. And I said it a little bit earlier, but there's a real appreciation for the fact that especially landfill airspace is a precious commodity. Particularly when you think about it on the East Coast and on the West Coast, I mean, maybe not quite as much in the middle of the country, but definitely on the East Coast, I mean, you see it. Anybody who lives in New York sees it, anybody who lives in Boston sees it. And I'm not sure we've priced it that way over the years. You're seeing us price it that way. We recognize that these have a finite life to them. And so why fill them up with kind of low-priced tons when we can fill them up at a slower rate, maybe at higher price tons, preserve some of that airspace. Give us time to figure out our solution once those do ultimately go away.\nMichael Hoffman: Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Looking forward to seeing you in New Orleans.\nJim Fish: Thanks Michael.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is open.\nKevin Chiang: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe just on -- in your prepared remarks, you talked about the MRF you opened in Toronto here. Just wondering how that positions you given the province -- if Ontario is looking to put in a producer responsibility legislation or as producer responsibility legislation? Does this MRF make you more competitive as you think of the opportunities stemming from that legislation?\nJim Fish: I think it does, Ken, I think it puts us in a great position there. It's the highest growth province in Canada, and Toronto is the biggest city in Canada. So, it puts us in a really, really good position add to that -- that this MRF will be one of the new style MRF, so with a lot of automation in it. So, it comes to us, as any of our new MRF will, with lower labor cost, 30% is what we're seeing in terms of labor cost per unit with the automation that we're adding. So, we're excited about the MRF coming in to Toronto. It's, in our mind, it's a perfect place to put a new MRF.\nKevin Chiang: Perfect. No, that makes a ton of sense. And maybe just the EPA did come out with, I guess, a Phase 3 proposal on heavy-duty vehicles, looking to continue to drive to some sort of net zero target over time. And I'm just wondering how you view that. I know you obviously had the curves here versus some of your peers on investing in CNG and RNG suites. But just given some of the stuff you've seen, not sure if you think that impacts your fleet strategy or maybe the need to accelerate some of the investments in electrification or other -- or some other type of propulsion system that gets you to some sort of GHG emission target based on the EPA's proposal here.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Kevin, I mean, listen, we've talked a lot about our CNG, RNG strategy and obviously really pleased with the way that's gone and with the outlook of that is, especially as we continue to bring on these R&D plans. But at the same time, we are continuing to look at other propulsion techniques, if you will. Electrification always comes to mind. People are talking about hydrogen. I think the good news is two things. One, we have our toe in all those ponds in terms of watching all the technology advancement and see how it's not only going to progress to commercialization, but commercialization through a heavy-duty fleet like ours, which are two distinctions. So, I think we're in a good spot there regardless of what the technologies. Our fleet strategy is evidenced by what we've done from diesel -- gen 1 diesel, gen 2 to CNG/RNG that we have the flexibility within our fleet plan to be able to pivot without really impacting the business.\nJim Fish: I think, Kevin, one important point here about electrification is that it's not a surprise to anybody on this call. The infrastructure is simply not there yet to handle this. I mean, when California is telling people with electric vehicles to not charge their vehicles last summer, and I don't know what the percentage of electric vehicles is in California, it's probably 5%, if that. You can -- we all know that the infrastructure is not prepared to handle electric vehicles. So, we've chosen to make that -- it's an incrementally positive step to go to C&G. We'll be at 75% probably by the end of the year. And our goal is to ultimately get to 90%. If the technology -- the price point, by the way, is important to us. I'm not going to pay three times for an electric vehicle, what I pay for a CNG vehicle. If all of those things are worked out, look, we're all in for moving to EV. But we need to see some progress on -- particularly on the infrastructure. And right now, I don't know that we're seeing any progress on infrastructure.\nKevin Chiang: Can I ask just a follow-up on that? Are your RNG or CNG trucks considered essentially net zero? Because effectively, you're in a unique position in that you also produce RNG as your landfill. But would a state like California look at your RNG fleet differently than, say, a typical owner operator running a Class A truck just because you're producing on the front end as well when you're creating a circular economy? Or is that still kind of an unknown now in terms of how they might treat that?\nJohn Morris: I think from a progression standpoint going from diesel to CNG, CNG-RNG, it's certainly going in the right direction. But I don't think that California, if it's a combustion engine. I'm not sure they would define it any other way, at least at this point in time.\nJim Fish: It's a good point, though, because RNG is a renewable fuel. So, if you're using a renewable fuel to fuel a CNG truck, I don't think you have to be a mathematician to figure that out. It should be a net zero. But I don't think -- to John's point, I don't think they look at it that way today. .\nKevin Chiang: Okay. Thanks for the color and best of luck to 2023 year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sean Eastman with KeyBanc. Your line is open.\nSean Eastman: Hi team. I just wanted to confirm that all the guidance is intact, and in particular, including the collection and disposal yield, I think you guys have given us approaching 5.5% number. Just wanted to get that confirmation.\nDevina Rankin: So, yes, at this point, we're good with each element of the guidance. So, as Jim was saying earlier, specific to the commodity-based businesses, we have some caution around those. But when we look at the yield component, we actually see the revenue results including yield for Q1 being a little ahead of our plan. So, we're certainly confident in that aspect of the guidance that we provided.\nSean Eastman: Okay, excellent. That's helpful. And then is there sort of a logical approach we can take to this combined recycling and renewable energy line that's now in the revenue build? I mean, I'm just kind of scratching my head a little bit on how to apply some science to the model there.\nDevina Rankin: Sure. What we intend to do there, at one point, we had moved our renewable energy business into the fuel line, and with some of the noise it was creating in the fuel line, we saw value in pulling that out. What we do is try and work ourselves towards providing better clarity about the key drivers of our business. And because renewable energy and recycling both have commodity-based impacts, we thought looking at those on a combined basis made some sense. And if you need additional color on that, Ed and Heather are sure to get you the details that you need.\nSean Eastman: Okay, helpful. I'll turn it over. Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you, Sean.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question.\nJim Fish: Good morning.\nStephanie Moore: I wanted to touch on -- clearly, you have made pretty meaningful progress in SG&A reduction and just your focus on cost cutting. But maybe you could touch a little bit about if there's any change in your approach to acquisitions as you continue to kind of balance SG&A reduction as well as acquisitions. And has there been any change in terms of how you look at deals, the integration opportunity, level of automation or other savings that you can get and if that's kind of changed your M&A philosophy a bit as you take a bit more of a cost-focused approach here.\nJim Fish: Yes, it's a good question because I wouldn't say that our approach has changed. We always are looking at what makes best sense for the shareholders. But I do think your point about being kind of an added synergy here is an important one. And we are factoring that in as we look at some of these companies. This is truly going to be a differentiator for us as we -- I talked about in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that we are taking cost out of our customer experience centers because we're using a self-service model now. And that was not insignificant. That is something that differentiates us from others who simply don't have that technology in place. So, it becomes a synergy for us as we acquire businesses.\nStephanie Moore: No, that's helpful. And maybe taking that a step further. As you continue to look to do M&A as well as you move forward with cost-cutting investments. Is the opportunity for that maybe near-term dilutive impact from M&A in a given period of time to maybe diminish over time because of this? Or how are you thinking about that opportunity?\nDevina Rankin: So, I think what's important in giving color to the dilutive impact from the M&A that we saw in Q1, it really was twofold. One, in the solid waste business, we make investments in our facilities, the fleet, and our people right up front and that's the cost impact that you saw in the first quarter for the solid waste acquisitions. And then on the recycling part of the business, the Natura business is in early stages and we're making some investments there, too. And that cost about $6 million to the quarter just in terms of incremental spending that we did on the business. So, neither of those really were seeing the full benefit of leverage on the SG&A front -- I'm sorry, it wasn't that they weren't seeing the benefit of the leverage on the SG&A front, we were capturing and realizing that. It was more about investment in the operations and the long-term viability of each of those businesses. And we're making the progress that we expect to make so that they have incremental value creation for both the market in the solid waste business that we acquired, and then also thinking about the differentiated service model that we will now have in the recycling part of the business because this is a new line of business for us.\nStephanie Moore: Understood. Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. Your line is open.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. With respect to driver retention and overall compensation in that area of your labor force, how do you expect that to trend, and particularly in the macroeconomic headwinds? And how much room for improvement could there be based on the historical ranges of those metrics in prior downturns? Thanks.\nJohn Morris: So, it's a good question. So, I think if you look kind of pre-pandemic through the pandemic, we went from obviously historic averages to historic lows, right, in terms of driver retention and turnover for obvious reasons. As we exited those numbers, went up past historic averages. And we've been working really earnestly the last two years not just on the wage front, but from an employee experience to get those numbers down. And I would tell you, we've made 400 to 500 basis points of improvement in a lot of those key frontline roles, and. You heard me in my prepared remarks talk about some of the peak wage inflation where it's moderated to now. So, that's clearly going in the right direction. But the biggest benefit really is when you can stabilize the workforce, those frontline folks. And we talked a lot about drivers, it's our biggest population. Your service gets better, your safety gets better and overtime ratios, training hours and all those things start to go the right way and we started to see signs of that in Q1.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. When you entertain conversations with smaller players in your M&A outreach, what are you hearing from them about the impact of higher rates and the kind of persistent required tech investments to stay competitive with the market?\nJim Fish: I don't know that we're hearing a lot about tech because I'm just not -- I think they're more focused on how do they keep drivers on the road. We are hearing that, and some of the companies that we've acquired are showing double the turnover that we're showing. It's why we think there's an opportunity for us to take share -- continue to take share, first, because I think the customer service product that we are providing is superior. When you are able to hold a lot of your drivers, it makes a big difference in that customer lifetime value proposition. So, we are hearing that, that turnover has become a consistent and recurring problem for a lot of those companies. I think the other thing that I would like to mention too is as we think about drivers, why it's imperative that we bring technology to this labor pool. It's a shrinking labor pool. We've talked about it a lot. The Gen Z doesn't want to drive trucks the way a Baby Boomer or Gen X did. So, how do we take advantage of that and the way we take advantage of it is by bringing technology to squeeze 5%, 10% maybe even 15% optimization out. And that's exactly what we're doing in building an optimization tool that understands absolutely the best route to take. It understands things like location of carts. We finally now know where all of our assets are. It understands the expertise of drivers. I mean, there's a whole bunch of factors that go into a full optimization. And I guarantee there's not anybody else out there that's able to do that. It is not inexpensive to optimize that. But once we optimize it, then we become less reliant on labor. And it's a labor-intensive business, and we have 25% turnover in those driver ranks. How do I take advantage of that? And it's got to be through technology.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft with Gabelli. Your line is open.\nTony Bancroft: Thanks for the question. Actually a quick one. Would you review -- just quickly review sort of the impact that -- the potential impact from PFAS may or may not have on how the cost of landfills and sort of how -- I know there's going to be some rulings or some hearings coming out here over the next few months about it. But how do you see that playing out? And how do you see that impacting your business?\nJim Fish: Yes. So, we've said that we think PFAS is more of an opportunity than a risk for us. It is kind of ubiquitous in these landfills and in the material that comes into them. It has been, at this point, EPA has designated PFAS as a hazardous material. And so I think they're going to have to understand the fact that hazardous sites are -- there are far fewer of them than there are non-haz sites. So, I think EPA is still trying to kind of work their way through PFAS. But it is worth saying that we view this as a big opportunity for us and for all landfill companies once they've kind of finally decided exactly how this is going to be handled.\nTony Bancroft: Thanks so much Jim. Congratulations.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Good morning. First question, I guess, is how to think about fuel rolling over in terms of impact to EBITDA and margins over the rest of the year. You have such a high percentage of the fleet on natural gas versus peers. So, maybe it doesn't impact the cost line as much, but perhaps a surcharge line. If you can just give us some guidepost on how to be modeling that or how to be thinking about that, that would be helpful.\nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question, Noah. So, in terms of the impact, I think when you look at 2022, and the IRD table that we do I think is the best data point for that, fuel was a really significant contributor. And we've already seen in Q1, our fuel surcharge revenue in Q1 versus Q4 of last year was less than half on a year -- or on a sequential basis. And so what we are seeing is that, that revenue decline should actually benefit the margin side of the business. We didn't really see any meaningful margin impact in the first quarter, but we do expect that we will see some margin impact over the remainder of the year. We're also taking some important steps that we think are beneficial in terms of looking at the overall cost structure of the organization that is dependent upon the fact that we are at 75% CNG for fleet and delivery. But when we look at our consumption, we don't just look at the collection line of business. We look at the heavy equipment at our landfills and all of that. So, we're looking at making sure that we're not just doing a diesel-based fuel surcharge, we're doing a blended surcharge. And some of those changes, our customers are going to begin to see in the second quarter. So, we're confident that we're going to maintain that true pass-through model that we've had over the last many, many years. It just will look a little bit different in future quarters, both because of the lapping of the really significant increases in diesel that we saw a year ago, but also because we're taking some structural changes with how we bill that to our customers.\nNoah Kaye: That's really interesting. And I mean, there's benefits here potentially to the customers as well because historically, I mean, I forget the last few years. But historically, CNG fuel prices have been more stable relatively. So, would that change just be received positively by customers as maybe a way to help reduce volatility to them on the cost side?\nDevina Rankin: We absolutely see that as something that our customers will receive well. And our customers already like the fact that, that CNG truck that's rolling down the street is quieter than the diesel vehicle. We see this as something else that the customers will receive as a positive from WM investing economically and environmentally beneficially in a differentiated fleet to service.\nNoah Kaye: Great. And then just on recycling, just trying to get some better gauges or indicators of demand. Maybe you can talk to your sense of the mills inventory position on recycled fiber. Maybe characterize the flow of impounds and inbound. I'm guessing kind of late 3Q, you probably didn't hear a lot of phones ringing in terms of requests for product. How is it trending now?\nJohn Morris: Yes, I think we benefited from -- we've talked a lot about our brokerage business being part of the recycling portfolio, and what that's always -- what that's added to us as a benefit is our ability to move the material. So, we don't have any issue moving the material we're bringing in. And even where we're growing volumes, we're still able to move that material. I think the interesting thing, Jim, I think, touched on this, is that there is some domestic capacity that's opening up here this year. And we've seen a little bit of positive movement here just late in the last handful of weeks on some of the fiber pricing. And Jim mentioned that overall, the whole basket of goods has moved up here a little bit as we exited Q4 into Q1 and then even exiting Q1 into Q2.\nJim Fish: No, it also helps that China's open back up. And while we don't send a lot of stuff straight to China anymore, they do affect worldwide demand. And when China has closed down with their COVID policy, that hurt worldwide demand. Now, that they've chosen to reopen their economy, that is helping and that will help us out as well.\nNoah Kaye: Makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I will now like to turn the call back to Jim Fish, President and CEO for closing remarks.\nJim Fish: All right. Thank you, Tawanda. I guess just to conclude here you've heard that we're on track for another solid year. We were right on plan for the first quarter. Looking forward to seeing a lot of you next week in New Orleans. Should be enjoyable. So, thanks for joining us this morning, and we'll see you next week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Thanks Ed and thank you all for joining us. We're off to a solid start in 2023 with first quarter results, delivering on our expectations and keeping us on track to achieve our full year guidance. First quarter revenue grew 5% with continued strong organic growth in the collection and disposal business of 7%. We're pleased with these results, particularly when you consider the impact of West Coast weather disruptions on our operations. With that said, our first quarter performance was basically on our budget and our strategic priorities of maintaining strong price discipline, permanently reducing our operating and SG&A cost structure through business optimization, technology and automation and leveraging our sustainability platform for growth are right on track. Executing on these priorities will produce the robust short-term and long-term financial performance that we've projected. As you heard at our Sustainability Investor Day at the beginning of the month, we're very enthusiastic about how the growth in our renewable energy and recycling businesses strengthens WM's compelling investment thesis. We expect the investments that we're making over the next several years to provide meaningful operating EBITDA and free cash flow growth with impressive returns. We remain on track to bring online two new renewable natural gas facilities and seven newly automated material recovery facilities by the end of the year. We're also opening one new MRF in 2023 in the Greater Toronto area, which positions us strongly in the largest growth market in Canada. Even as these important parts of our operations grow our solid waste business will continue to make up the lion's share of our earnings, projected to generate roughly 85% of operating EBITDA in 2026. As a result, our focus on optimizing performance and reducing costs in the solid waste business through technology and automation is critically important and will serve to further separate us from our competition. One excellent example of this is the expansion of our customer self-service capabilities where we've reduced our call center department costs in the first quarter by more than 20% compared to last year, while at the same time maintaining or improving our Net Promoter Scores in the commercial and industrial lines of business. So far in 2023, the WM team continues to deliver strong performance. The investments we're making set us up to further differentiate our industry leading asset network and capabilities. When you combine these strategic positioning -- when you combine this strategic positioning with the essential nature of our service, our diverse customer base and our recurring revenue streams, it provides confidence in our ability to continue to reach our strong financial projections over the long-term. For the remainder of 2023, our outlook remains consistent with the full year guidance provided at the beginning of the year, including adjusted operating EBITDA growth of 7% at the midpoint and between 40 and 80 basis points of adjusted operating EBITDA margin expansion, driven by our collection and disposal business. In closing, I want to thank the 49,000 people behind WM's success this quarter and every quarter. Without this team, none of this would be possible. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results for the quarter. Yes. Bryan, we are still looking to see $70 for 2023. The trend has been good and it's what we anticipated. So, at the end of Q4, we were at $47. Q1 was at $54, but it got better as you went through the quarter. So, $57 was our average in the month of March. And then as we're getting into April, we're seeing that continue to improve. Couple of things are helping us. The mill capacity that's coming online is helping with demand on the back end. We're also seeing a pretty significant uptick in pricing for plastics, for aluminums and a little bit for OCC. So, we are still sticking with our $70 and feel pretty confident in that. So, John can address the cost side and what we're seeing so far. I would tell you that as far as the overall macro economy, we've been looking at it closely because it seems as if every day, somebody comes out with a different projection. Maybe the best indicators for us are things like churn and price rollbacks. Those have been at the historic low end of our ranges and continue to be there. Also looking at some of our volume numbers, especially MSW, MSW was 2.7%. It's around 3% still. So, those are pretty good signs for the overall economy. Now we tend to be kind of at the back end. So, sometimes we don't see the early signs. But everything we're looking at still seems to be okay. It doesn't look like a blowout for sure, but it doesn't look like the bottom is falling out. So, that's encouraging. Good morning. I think, Jerry, it's also worth mentioning that our team is, over the years -- the last couple of years has really come to appreciate the fact that landfill aerospace is a precious commodity and if you think about particularly the East Coast, that space doesn't come cheaply and it's -- there's a finite life to all of those. So, we need to price it that way. And that's, in large part, what you're seeing out of transportation but also largely landfill pricing. So, on the call center side, we did not refill about 580 positions last year and there are another 300 that we will choose not to refill this year. So, I would say we're probably -- we were probably 60% of the way there on that piece. But some of those other positions that we've talked about, John mentioned it, which is replacing reloaders with ASOs. And he talked about 30% productivity pick up there. We're not -- because we haven't been receiving the trucks, I mean, you can't make that swap obviously without the truck. There's some work that's involved with our public sector team. They have to talk to our customers and make sure that they're comfortable with going to trash just being in one of those totters [ph] as opposed to everything sitting on the curve. But -- and they've made nice progress there. But as we do that, we think there's another probably up to 2,000 positions that are helpful positions that we just will choose not to refill. And as you can imagine, those have very high turnover, somewhere in the neighborhood of 50% for those. So, once those trucks come in, once we've talked to the customer base, we will transition those. And maybe the most important piece that John mentioned is it helps us from a safety standpoint. 70% our injuries happen in the residential line of business. And I would guess that 90% of that 70% are on rear loaders. Yes. Look, I didn't see what their numbers were at. But I would tell you this, first of all, I looked back. Historically, we anticipated the question. And historically, Q1 has been the lowest yield for us over a period of probably a decade. It's almost always been the lowest yield number on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But when I look at how we're doing with things like rollback of price and churn, those are, as I said, near the bottom end of our historic ranges. And I also was very encouraged to see pricing in two particular places that we're encouraging: residential, which John talked about, and landfill and transfer. Those are -- we just talked about it with Jerry, but those were really important areas for us to kind of -- all three of those. When we talk about it probably four years ago, we're talking about something less than 1%. And now we're talking about much higher numbers, albeit in a higher inflation environment. But still, I think you're seeing the discipline there around pricing very strong. So, I don't know really what the other folks reported, but I would tell you, there's no loss of discipline whatsoever. There's really, I think, Tyler, three areas that we're all focused on for 2023, and those are top of line -- at the very top of the list has got to be price, and then a close second to that is what John has been talking about, which is cost control, both SG&A and OpEx and using technology to facilitate that. And then, of course, the third one is when we talked about three weeks ago, which are those sustainability investments. So, those three are really kind of our near-term focus that will help us out in the long-term. And it was not -- there wasn't one less workday. We still had to work those days. It's just we paid everybody time and a half. Good morning Michael. I like the way you said that, Michael. I was trying to figure out a good way to say that. You said it better than I would. But you're right. I mean, it's -- in any big business, there's going to be a few things that work in our favor, a few things that work against us. RIN pricing is probably a little bit against us right now. We budgeted $2.30, and it's $2. So, that one may end up being a little bit of a headwind. But we've also gone through some of the tailwinds, too. I mean SG&A, is -- I'm not sure we've ever had an SG&A number as a percent of revenue below 10% for the first quarter because the revenue base is always low for Q1. So, we're doing a better job on SG&A than we actually anticipated. I could say the same thing about MSW volume or a couple of the other things. So, you're right. There's a few things that are coming in a little lower than our expectation. RIN pricing would be one of those. On the other side, recycle pricing, as we talked about a little bit earlier, is right on our expectations. So, we're pleased with that because I know there were a few that had questioned our $70 number, and that looks like it's probably going to hold. So, I think you're right about the fact that there's a whole bunch of pieces in play here. I think it will continue to close. And I said it a little bit earlier, but there's a real appreciation for the fact that especially landfill airspace is a precious commodity. Particularly when you think about it on the East Coast and on the West Coast, I mean, maybe not quite as much in the middle of the country, but definitely on the East Coast, I mean, you see it. Anybody who lives in New York sees it, anybody who lives in Boston sees it. And I'm not sure we've priced it that way over the years. You're seeing us price it that way. We recognize that these have a finite life to them. And so why fill them up with kind of low-priced tons when we can fill them up at a slower rate, maybe at higher price tons, preserve some of that airspace. Give us time to figure out our solution once those do ultimately go away. Thanks Michael. I think it does, Ken, I think it puts us in a great position there. It's the highest growth province in Canada, and Toronto is the biggest city in Canada. So, it puts us in a really, really good position add to that -- that this MRF will be one of the new style MRF, so with a lot of automation in it. So, it comes to us, as any of our new MRF will, with lower labor cost, 30% is what we're seeing in terms of labor cost per unit with the automation that we're adding. So, we're excited about the MRF coming in to Toronto. It's, in our mind, it's a perfect place to put a new MRF. I think, Kevin, one important point here about electrification is that it's not a surprise to anybody on this call. The infrastructure is simply not there yet to handle this. I mean, when California is telling people with electric vehicles to not charge their vehicles last summer, and I don't know what the percentage of electric vehicles is in California, it's probably 5%, if that. You can -- we all know that the infrastructure is not prepared to handle electric vehicles. So, we've chosen to make that -- it's an incrementally positive step to go to C&G. We'll be at 75% probably by the end of the year. And our goal is to ultimately get to 90%. If the technology -- the price point, by the way, is important to us. I'm not going to pay three times for an electric vehicle, what I pay for a CNG vehicle. If all of those things are worked out, look, we're all in for moving to EV. But we need to see some progress on -- particularly on the infrastructure. And right now, I don't know that we're seeing any progress on infrastructure. It's a good point, though, because RNG is a renewable fuel. So, if you're using a renewable fuel to fuel a CNG truck, I don't think you have to be a mathematician to figure that out. It should be a net zero. But I don't think -- to John's point, I don't think they look at it that way today. . Good morning. Yes, it's a good question because I wouldn't say that our approach has changed. We always are looking at what makes best sense for the shareholders. But I do think your point about being kind of an added synergy here is an important one. And we are factoring that in as we look at some of these companies. This is truly going to be a differentiator for us as we -- I talked about in my prepared remarks, I talked about the fact that we are taking cost out of our customer experience centers because we're using a self-service model now. And that was not insignificant. That is something that differentiates us from others who simply don't have that technology in place. So, it becomes a synergy for us as we acquire businesses. I don't know that we're hearing a lot about tech because I'm just not -- I think they're more focused on how do they keep drivers on the road. We are hearing that, and some of the companies that we've acquired are showing double the turnover that we're showing. It's why we think there's an opportunity for us to take share -- continue to take share, first, because I think the customer service product that we are providing is superior. When you are able to hold a lot of your drivers, it makes a big difference in that customer lifetime value proposition. So, we are hearing that, that turnover has become a consistent and recurring problem for a lot of those companies. I think the other thing that I would like to mention too is as we think about drivers, why it's imperative that we bring technology to this labor pool. It's a shrinking labor pool. We've talked about it a lot. The Gen Z doesn't want to drive trucks the way a Baby Boomer or Gen X did. So, how do we take advantage of that and the way we take advantage of it is by bringing technology to squeeze 5%, 10% maybe even 15% optimization out. And that's exactly what we're doing in building an optimization tool that understands absolutely the best route to take. It understands things like location of carts. We finally now know where all of our assets are. It understands the expertise of drivers. I mean, there's a whole bunch of factors that go into a full optimization. And I guarantee there's not anybody else out there that's able to do that. It is not inexpensive to optimize that. But once we optimize it, then we become less reliant on labor. And it's a labor-intensive business, and we have 25% turnover in those driver ranks. How do I take advantage of that? And it's got to be through technology. Yes. So, we've said that we think PFAS is more of an opportunity than a risk for us. It is kind of ubiquitous in these landfills and in the material that comes into them. It has been, at this point, EPA has designated PFAS as a hazardous material. And so I think they're going to have to understand the fact that hazardous sites are -- there are far fewer of them than there are non-haz sites. So, I think EPA is still trying to kind of work their way through PFAS. But it is worth saying that we view this as a big opportunity for us and for all landfill companies once they've kind of finally decided exactly how this is going to be handled. Thank you. No, it also helps that China's open back up. And while we don't send a lot of stuff straight to China anymore, they do affect worldwide demand. And when China has closed down with their COVID policy, that hurt worldwide demand. Now, that they've chosen to reopen their economy, that is helping and that will help us out as well. All right. Thank you, Tawanda. I guess just to conclude here you've heard that we're on track for another solid year. We were right on plan for the first quarter. Looking forward to seeing a lot of you next week in New Orleans. Should be enjoyable. So, thanks for joining us this morning, and we'll see you next week."

            "content": "Thanks John and good morning. We're pleased to see our robust revenue growth and disciplined focus on cost control translate into solid operating and free cash flow. First quarter cash flow from operations of $1.04 billion is in line with our plan and a strong result, particularly when you consider higher cash interest and incentive compensation payments. Capital spending in the quarter totaled $660 million, with $504 million related to normal course capital to support our business and $156 million of spending on sustainability growth projects. On the capital front, there are two key takeaways. The first is that we're pleased with the continued progress on our sustainability growth projects relative to plan. The second is that truck deliveries are improving. At this time last year, we have received less than 50 trucks. This year, we received about 470. While this is certainly better and shows some easing of the significant supply chain constraints from a year ago, we're still waiting for truck deliveries we planned for 2022. These delays impact our team's ability to deliver on residential collection optimization objectives and targeted improvements in our maintenance cost per driver hour. So, while we're encouraged the worst of the recent uncertainty is behind us, we still need to see a more reliable delivery schedule from manufacturers. Our business generated free cash flow of $395 million in the first quarter and free cash flow before sustainability growth investments of $551 million, which puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance on this measure of between $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion. Even as we invest in high-return sustainability growth projects within our business, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned $639 million to shareholders during the quarter, paying $289 million in dividends and repurchasing $350 million of our stock. We expect dividends to total about $1.1 billion this year. And with our outlook for strong earnings growth over the remainder of the year in a healthy balance sheet we expect to continue to repurchase our shares fairly ratably over the remainder of the year. Our leverage ratio at the end of the first quarter was 2 times, which is well within our target ratio of between 2.5 and 3 times. About 18% of our total debt portfolio is at variable rates and our pretax weighted average cost of debt for the quarter was about 3.7%. Our balance sheet is strong, and we remain well-positioned to fund growth investments. Turning to SG&A, we're pleased with the progress we're making to drive leverage from a more efficient cost structure. In the first quarter, SG&A costs were essentially flat with the same period in the prior year, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 40 basis points to 9.7%. These results demonstrate our success in rationalizing costs and optimizing our sales and customer experience functions. We expect our investments to continue to drive improvement in SG&A costs and put us on a path toward a permanently reduced SG&A cost structure. Our operating EBITDA margin performance for the quarter was generally in line with our expectations. The 40 basis point margin decline year-over-year is due to three things; one, commodity price impacts on our renewable energy and recycling businesses, which created a 50 basis point margin headwind. Two, the dilutive impact of acquisitions completed in late 2022, which had about a 40 basis point impact. And three, cost pressure in our collection and just local business from wage inflation and delayed truck deliveries, which we estimate had about a 20 basis point impact. These margin impacts were offset in part by a 40 basis point improvement in SG&A and a 30 basis point benefit from the timing of alternative fuel tax credit. Our disciplined organic revenue growth and focus on optimization and cost control are expected to drive year-over-year margin expansion for the remainder of the year, particularly in the third and fourth quarters. In closing, the WM team has delivered a solid start to the year, which sets us up for another year of strong financial growth in 2023. I can't thank our hard-working team members enough for all of their contributions to our success. With that, Tawanda, let's open the line for questions. Yes, it's a great question. We definitely see the lion's share of that contribution of EBITDA margin coming in the third and fourth quarters. We do expect some improvement from what we saw in the first quarter. I want to point out a couple of things that happened in Q1 that we don't see as indicative of the margins that we'll expect for the remainder of the year. As I mentioned on the commodity businesses, that was 50 basis points of the impact in the quarter. We expected our first quarter to be the hardest comp on a year-over-year basis from commodity prices, and so we think most of that impact starts to abate beginning in Q2. But as I said, most of that really comes in Q3 and Q4 when the year-over-year comparisons on commodity prices improve. On the dilutive impact of M&A at 40 basis points, that was about half solid waste and half recycling. And like I said, we're pleased with the traction that we're seeing in each of those businesses on the recycling side because that business is in a development phase. We knew that there would be some upfront costs associated with integrating that business. They just happen to be higher than our expectations. We don't expect that to continue over the remainder of the year. So, that's another thing that gives us confidence. On the solid waste side, we took a really important step that's team member-focused and an investment in our frontline by making the MLK holiday across the entire organization. That emphasizes our focus on people first, but that is a Q1-only event, and that's something else that will abate for the rest of the year. So, those are the things that give us confidence that the Q1 results of 40 basis points will exceed what you see for the remainder of the year. And in fact, we do see some of that coming out in Q2, but Q3 and Q4 is really where you start to see some strong results. Yes, it's a great question, Jerry. And that's some of the analysis we've been particularly honed in and on and looking at. And that is our expectation, is that the first quarter of 2023 had some margin pressures that we see as more related to 2023 specifically, such that the normal seasonal uptick that we see from a revenue perspective will provide the typical expansion. And then on top of that, we'll have some added benefits from lapping some of the commodity price impacts I've talked about. We're also expecting to see some strong accretive revenue come back in the collection line of business, in particular as our differentiated service model really pays some dividends in terms of our national accounts business where we are going to lap some of the contracts' expirations and we're going to see some contracts return. So, those are the things that give us so much confidence that Q2 really will be outsized relative to a typical year. Good morning. Sure. In terms of unit cost inflation, we expected in 2023 about 4% to 5% unit cost inflation for the year. And when we look at Q1, it was certainly higher than that. But our expectation is that, that moderates. And as John has talked about, in particular, labor and repair and maintenance are expected to benefit from the actions that we saw early signs of as we looked at February, March, but we expect to continue to gain momentum over the remainder of the year. Yes. So, let me take that in pieces. The alternative fuel tax credit was a help of 30 basis points, and that's a help because of timing. So, you might recall that last year, we got -- there was a delay in the approval of those tax credits by government. And so there was a delay in our recognition of those tax credit benefits until the third quarter of 2022. So, what you're seeing this year is that those are going to be recognized quarter-by-quarter. So, we got the benefit in Q1. We'll have another benefit in Q2 and then that moderates in Q3, reverses itself, and then normalizes beginning in Q4. On the dilutive impact from commodity businesses of 50 basis points, you had that right. Incentive compensation was cash flow. So, yes, that was a cash flow impact. When we gave our guidance for 2023, we talked about working capital being a headwind in the year. And a lot of that headwind, really all of that headwind was in the first quarter as anticipated because higher incentive compensation payments happened in Q1 because of the 2022 outperformance relative to our plan. So, that moderates and really starts to become a tailwind over the remainder of the year. On the solid waste side, when I was mentioning the MLK holiday, that was part of the 20 basis point margin headwind that we saw from the solid waste part of the business. What's really important there, I think, in terms of thinking about what it means for the rest of the year is that, that impact isn't something that repeats itself. It actually doesn't become a help necessarily, but it's not something that we see repeating over the remainder of the year because it was a onetime event. Thanks Tyler. Hey. From an asset utilization perspective, Michael, I think it's important that as John mentioned, it takes 35 to 40 days to get those new trucks in service and on the road. That means that we've been holding on to some of our older vehicles longer. And so asset utilization, not necessarily where we like it to be. But that's because we've needed to be intentional about keeping our vehicles and maintaining them so that we meet all of our service needs for our customers. Yes, you're right, Michael. About 70% of our resets are in the first half of the year, and those are all indexed to a year ago activity. And so we'll see some of that benefit as we go through the rest of the year in terms of where inflation headline numbers continue to be high. So, yes, at this point, we're good with each element of the guidance. So, as Jim was saying earlier, specific to the commodity-based businesses, we have some caution around those. But when we look at the yield component, we actually see the revenue results including yield for Q1 being a little ahead of our plan. So, we're certainly confident in that aspect of the guidance that we provided. Sure. What we intend to do there, at one point, we had moved our renewable energy business into the fuel line, and with some of the noise it was creating in the fuel line, we saw value in pulling that out. What we do is try and work ourselves towards providing better clarity about the key drivers of our business. And because renewable energy and recycling both have commodity-based impacts, we thought looking at those on a combined basis made some sense. And if you need additional color on that, Ed and Heather are sure to get you the details that you need. Thank you, Sean. So, I think what's important in giving color to the dilutive impact from the M&A that we saw in Q1, it really was twofold. One, in the solid waste business, we make investments in our facilities, the fleet, and our people right up front and that's the cost impact that you saw in the first quarter for the solid waste acquisitions. And then on the recycling part of the business, the Natura business is in early stages and we're making some investments there, too. And that cost about $6 million to the quarter just in terms of incremental spending that we did on the business. So, neither of those really were seeing the full benefit of leverage on the SG&A front -- I'm sorry, it wasn't that they weren't seeing the benefit of the leverage on the SG&A front, we were capturing and realizing that. It was more about investment in the operations and the long-term viability of each of those businesses. And we're making the progress that we expect to make so that they have incremental value creation for both the market in the solid waste business that we acquired, and then also thinking about the differentiated service model that we will now have in the recycling part of the business because this is a new line of business for us. Yes, it's a great question, Noah. So, in terms of the impact, I think when you look at 2022, and the IRD table that we do I think is the best data point for that, fuel was a really significant contributor. And we've already seen in Q1, our fuel surcharge revenue in Q1 versus Q4 of last year was less than half on a year -- or on a sequential basis. And so what we are seeing is that, that revenue decline should actually benefit the margin side of the business. We didn't really see any meaningful margin impact in the first quarter, but we do expect that we will see some margin impact over the remainder of the year. We're also taking some important steps that we think are beneficial in terms of looking at the overall cost structure of the organization that is dependent upon the fact that we are at 75% CNG for fleet and delivery. But when we look at our consumption, we don't just look at the collection line of business. We look at the heavy equipment at our landfills and all of that. So, we're looking at making sure that we're not just doing a diesel-based fuel surcharge, we're doing a blended surcharge. And some of those changes, our customers are going to begin to see in the second quarter. So, we're confident that we're going to maintain that true pass-through model that we've had over the last many, many years. It just will look a little bit different in future quarters, both because of the lapping of the really significant increases in diesel that we saw a year ago, but also because we're taking some structural changes with how we bill that to our customers. We absolutely see that as something that our customers will receive well. And our customers already like the fact that, that CNG truck that's rolling down the street is quieter than the diesel vehicle. We see this as something else that the customers will receive as a positive from WM investing economically and environmentally beneficially in a differentiated fleet to service."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks Jim and good morning. 2023 has started off as planned and we're pleased to have achieved our first quarter targets. Overall adjusted operating EBITDA grew nearly 4% and operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew 7% in the quarter. One area that exceeded our expectations was pricing as we continue to execute on our revenue management programs to recover cost increases and improve margins. As Jim mentioned, our first quarter organic revenue growth in the collection and disposal business was 7%. This growth was led by core price of 7.4%, which exceeded both last year and our plan for the first quarter. This strong core price translated into collection and disposal yield of 6.2%, a 70 basis point improvement compared with Q1 of 2022. We saw strong yield performance across all lines of business and are particularly proud of our post collection yield. We have consistently emphasized the importance of post collection pricing and in Q1, we delivered yield of 8.9% of our transfer stations, and 5.4% for landfill MSW, both increases from last year. In fact, the transfer station yield is a new high for that line of business, which is helping to offset, increasing cost of labor and transportation. Our collective focus continues to be striking the right balance between maximizing customer lifetime value and increasing price to recover higher costs. We remain confident that we can achieve our full year pricing expectations for core price of 6.5% to 7% and yield approaching 5.5%. Turning to volumes, first quarter collection and disposal volume grew 0.8%. Landfill volumes led the way with C&D volumes up almost 37% in the quarter, driven by the hurricane cleanup in Florida and MSW volumes increased by almost 3%. Special waste volumes moderated in the quarter due to the timing of event-driven work, but our pipeline remains robust, and we believe that those volumes will provide incremental revenue growth as we progress through Q2 and the balance of the year. Our collection volumes were down modestly in the quarter, driven by intentional steps we continue to take to price every contract to achieve acceptable returns. This has led to some non-regrettable volume losses in our residential and commercial business. With profitability improving in each line of business and contract wins with healthy price increases, we're pleased to see our differentiated service and disciplined approach to yield benefits. For the full year, we continue to expect flat overall volumes at the midpoint of our guidance. Turning to operating expenses, which increased 70 basis points as a percentage of revenue to 63%. I want to frame these results and then talk about the efforts in place to optimize our cost to serve in 2023 and over the long-term. There were two primary contributors to our first quarter results, the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and continued inflationary cost pressure. As a reminder, we closed on about $365 million of acquisitions of solid waste and recycling businesses in the second half of the year. Integration costs and upfront dilutive margins of these acquisitions had about a 35 basis point impact in the quarter. While this impact was a little more than expected, overall, we're very pleased with the progress being made on creating value from these businesses. The remaining impact was due to persistent cost inflation, which was most significant in wages, repair and maintenance and subcontractor costs. The good news is we see signs of easing cost pressures and the steps we are taking to combat higher costs are also showing benefits. Frontline wage increases are now in the mid-single-digit range as compared to the high single to low double-digit increases that we saw in late 2021 and 2022. And we're starting to see truck orders fulfilled, which benefits every aspect of our cost structure because employee engagement is better, downtime on route is minimized, repair costs to reduce, and expensive rentals can be eliminated. Getting trucks delivered will also be key to residential automation. As we move from traditional rear load to automated side loaders, we're taking a helper off the back and getting about a 30% productivity pickup, which equates to lower driver technician and truck capital needs. We talked a lot about the work we're doing to optimize our cost to serve. Investments we are making in our people and processes are also important. We're always working to make WM a great safe place to work and delivering our team members of best-in-class compensation and benefits package. One of the benefits we know that comes from these efforts is improved retention, which then translates into even better customer service and optimized cost structure because our tenured drivers are the safest and most efficient. In the first quarter of 2023, we saw the best driver retention we've seen in two years. This positions us to drive down our training and overtime hours, improve overall efficiency, and most important, see continued improvement in our safety performance. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team for the fantastic job they do safely and reliably serving our customers day in and day out. We've had a solid start to 2023 and look forward to building on our success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our financial results in further detail. No, So, I think -- listen, we're thrilled that the supply chain and truck deliveries are starting to abate. As Devina mentioned, we almost -- we delivered almost 500 trucks year-to-date versus 50 last year. It takes 30 to 45 days to get those vehicles sort of on the road and get the older vehicles off. So, there's a little bit of a lag. That was considered when we put together our plan for EBITDA and EBITDA margin this year. We went back and took a look before the call. We probably -- if you go back to kind of post-COVID, we're probably lagging 2,000-plus vehicles from what our fleet plan would have been. So, we're going to get a full complement of trucks this year, probably 1,500 to 1,600 is what we think. So, we're going to continue to get those assets in play as quick as we can and drive the benefit. But keep in mind, part of the M&R pressure is that -- it's not just the trucks we didn't get in 2022, it's we caught up in 2021 from 2022, 2022 to 2023, et cetera. I think on the cost side, Toni, I addressed the M&R and some of the challenges we have seen here. The good news is we're starting to open up. On the labor front, I said in my prepared comments, we were close to high single, low double digits, and that's moderated back down to mid-single-digits. So, that certainly is a benefit going forward throughout the year. Subcontractors, we're still seeing a little bit of lag there, and it's really more of third-party transporters. But as you saw within our post-collection pricing and more specifically our transfer stations, we continue to address that through the revenue quality of the remote gates at or the transfer station. I think -- when it all comes down to it, I think we talk about automation and optimization. It's really about permanently lowering our operating expense exposure. And that's really, as Jim mentioned, what we're really focused on for the balance of the year. Yes, Jerry. I would tell you that's something we've been working on, and that's been a tougher hill to climb, obviously, because those are bigger chunks of a volume and big customers when you're making those decisions. I think as I mentioned, the transportation piece, and a lot of that is labor and fuel, if you will, has continued to persist, which is why one of the reasons why you continue to see us be as aggressive as we are on the transfer station side. And on the landfill side, again, the cost of constructing and operating as landfills is not getting cheaper. So, part of our pricing strategy, obviously, a minimum to recover our investment there, but also look for margin improvement where that opportunity exists. So, the service interval piece, Michael, is still positive. That's the headline. In addition to the service intervals, though, as Jim mentioned in the commentary a few minutes ago, the other parts of that, that we're really paying close attention to is what the churn rate is doing and what the rollbacks are doing even as we continue to be aggressive on the pricing side. And those have all continued to stay static and in a good spot and service intervals are still positive. So we feel good about that. So, this is anecdotal, Michael, but we did our business refused with all our areas last week. And one of our areas actually was scheduled to return some rental trucks which, as you can imagine, are done at a premium. And we were told, hey, your trucks are going to be -- and it wasn't a large amount of trucks, less than a dozen trucks. But this area turned their trucks back in and then we got delayed another 30 or 45 days on some of the delivery. So, to Devina's point, there's a little pensiveness by the field, and we understand it's to send those trucks back, whether it's rentals or surplus assets. The good news is, like we said, there's almost 500 trucks that are on the ground, not in service yet. So, when we think about rentals and surplus assets, we have a clear path for the rest of the year and more confidence in the delivery schedule that we're going to be able to take those out. I don't know, Michael, we've seen a meaningful movement there. I would tell you, we don't talk about weather, but there was a handful of areas on the West Coast where we were shut down for a few days and some kind of really odd weather. But other than that, it's been -- I think the temp story has been a consistent one. So, we've said, Michael, about 40% of our revenue is indexed. It's not all CPI as we've talked about. The majority of that, though, really, as we all know, runs through that residential line of business. And that's when you look at the pricing and the yield results in residential, I think for the quarter, we were up $53 million in revenue. We're down about 29 in volume. So, we continue to down that path until we get to some acceptable spot there. And it's noteworthy that the residential line of business, as you can imagine, is one that eats a little more of the inflation, some of the other one due to the labor intensity and whatnot. But if you look at where CPI was last quarter or this quarter, you look at core price and yield, we're still pricing above that. So, we're getting traction even above that CPI number. Yes, Kevin, I mean, listen, we've talked a lot about our CNG, RNG strategy and obviously really pleased with the way that's gone and with the outlook of that is, especially as we continue to bring on these R&D plans. But at the same time, we are continuing to look at other propulsion techniques, if you will. Electrification always comes to mind. People are talking about hydrogen. I think the good news is two things. One, we have our toe in all those ponds in terms of watching all the technology advancement and see how it's not only going to progress to commercialization, but commercialization through a heavy-duty fleet like ours, which are two distinctions. So, I think we're in a good spot there regardless of what the technologies. Our fleet strategy is evidenced by what we've done from diesel -- gen 1 diesel, gen 2 to CNG/RNG that we have the flexibility within our fleet plan to be able to pivot without really impacting the business. I think from a progression standpoint going from diesel to CNG, CNG-RNG, it's certainly going in the right direction. But I don't think that California, if it's a combustion engine. I'm not sure they would define it any other way, at least at this point in time. So, it's a good question. So, I think if you look kind of pre-pandemic through the pandemic, we went from obviously historic averages to historic lows, right, in terms of driver retention and turnover for obvious reasons. As we exited those numbers, went up past historic averages. And we've been working really earnestly the last two years not just on the wage front, but from an employee experience to get those numbers down. And I would tell you, we've made 400 to 500 basis points of improvement in a lot of those key frontline roles, and. You heard me in my prepared remarks talk about some of the peak wage inflation where it's moderated to now. So, that's clearly going in the right direction. But the biggest benefit really is when you can stabilize the workforce, those frontline folks. And we talked a lot about drivers, it's our biggest population. Your service gets better, your safety gets better and overtime ratios, training hours and all those things start to go the right way and we started to see signs of that in Q1. Yes, I think we benefited from -- we've talked a lot about our brokerage business being part of the recycling portfolio, and what that's always -- what that's added to us as a benefit is our ability to move the material. So, we don't have any issue moving the material we're bringing in. And even where we're growing volumes, we're still able to move that material. I think the interesting thing, Jim, I think, touched on this, is that there is some domestic capacity that's opening up here this year. And we've seen a little bit of positive movement here just late in the last handful of weeks on some of the fiber pricing. And Jim mentioned that overall, the whole basket of goods has moved up here a little bit as we exited Q4 into Q1 and then even exiting Q1 into Q2."

Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Okay. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our quarterly results once again reflect robust operational performance in our collection and disposal business as well as our success executing on our strategic priorities. We're pleased to report another quarter of double-digit operating EBITDA growth, positioning us well to deliver about $6.5 billion for the full year, near the upper end of our guidance. Our cost optimization efforts and disciplined pricing programs together are increasing the spread between price growth and our cost to serve and our sustainability investments are providing margin accretive growth. As we'd anticipated, the third quarter set a new record for operating EBITDA margin at 30.5%, a year-over-year expansion of 90 basis points. This consistent growth underscores our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our shareholders. We remain focused on furthering our cost optimization efforts in collection and disposal in our collection and disposal business and improving frontline retention. And John will share more about the headway we're making here. Our teams are also hard at work integrating acquisitions in key markets and have closed nearly $800 million of solid waste acquisitions through the first nine months of the year with a strong pipeline of additional deals. We continue to progress towards closing the acquisition of Stericycle, which will add a complementary medical waste platform to our business and expand our suite service offerings. During the quarter, Stericycle shareholders approved the merger agreement. We received clearance from all international regulators, except for Canada, which is progressing. We're also advancing our integration planning, which has confirmed our confidence in the value of the Stericycle acquisition. We look forward to welcoming Stericycle team members to the WM team this quarter. Turning to recycling. During the quarter, we completed eight projects across our network, including six automation upgrades and new facilities in New York and Florida. Our team's focus on execution has been excellent with two of the projects completed in the quarter beginning operations ahead of plan. We've now completed 24 of the 39 projects in the growth program, which have added 1.5 million tons of annual recycling capacity across North America. Our automated recycling facilities are consistently delivering lower labor cost per ton and higher blended value on our commodity sales compared to our legacy plants, which translates into better operating EBITDA margins. In the renewable energy business, we remain on track to commission the four new renewable natural gas projects in the fourth quarter, adding to our DFW plants, which we brought online earlier this year. With these five projects, along with the two we completed prior to 2024, we will have seven of the 20 planned projects online by year-end. There are an additional 12 projects in active construction and the final plant will begin construction in early 2025. The seven projects are expected to contribute approximately 6 million MMBtus of annual production in 2025. Next year, is anticipated to be a pivotal year of contributions from renewable natural gas investments, and we're committed to scaling this unique opportunity to create long-term value for the environment and shareholders alike. We came into this year expecting strong execution across several fronts. And through the first nine months, we've delivered results that exceeded our own high expectations. As we look ahead to 2025, we anticipate continued growth in our solid waste business, increased contributions from our sustainability growth investments and the successful integration of the Stericycle business to come together to create a significant step change in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. I want to thank our dedicated team, whose hard work and commitment make all of this possible. And now, I'll turn the call over to John, who will provide a deeper dive into our operational results for the quarter.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before we dive in our operational performance and financial metrics, I want to take a minute to acknowledge and thank our team for providing safe and reliable service to our customers, especially considering the severe weather events. Hurricanes Helene and Milton effect of both our employees and the communities we serve. We are working hard to support those impacted helping restore a sense of normalcy in these areas. Turning to our results. We continue to prioritize technology and automation to optimize our cost structure and enhance operational efficiency. This is evident in operating expenses of 60.6% of revenue in the third quarter, which improved 70 basis points and overcame a 30 basis point headwind from additional workdays in the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter this measure has been below 61%. This quarter's result is driven by continued benefits from cost optimization, pricing discipline and easing inflation. We also benefited from lower fuel prices and stronger contributions from our renewable energy business, though these gains were offset by the impact of increased recycled commodity prices on the brokerage business. Our operating expense performance was largely driven by our collection business, in particular, in labor and repair and maintenance costs. Labor costs improved through a combination of retention, technology and automation. We've automated more than 800 routes in our residential fleet since 2022, reducing our labor dependence, boosting efficiency and improving safety performance. The continued adoption of scheduling and planning tools, advanced mapping systems and dynamic routing is also driving efficiency and reducing operating costs. In the third quarter, our weighted average collection efficiency rose by 2%, with the residential line of business increasing more than 4%. Our intentional focus on making WM a great place to build a career is leading to reduced driver and technician turnover, improving about 19% annualized, a significant improvement over last year. Repair and maintenance costs also improved as a percentage of revenue, driven by our ongoing implementation of technology-driven processes and improvements in our truck delivery schedule. Our focus and execution in these areas are leading to strong financial performance as adjusted operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew $181 million in the quarter, with margin expanding to 37.4%. Finally, turning to our revenue growth. Our pricing results continue to track well. Our team continues to leverage customer-specific data and insights to deliver pricing in line with inflation alongside our margin expansion objectives. We are being purposeful in allocating our people and our assets to their best use. This approach is very evident in our residential line of business, where we've intentionally moved away from lower-margin business, while at the same time, significantly improving our safety performance, growing organic revenue and expanding operating EBITDA margin. By maintaining and growing the right volumes, we are driving long-term value and enhancing overall returns. Our volume results have trended consistently to what we saw in the first half of the year with growth from commercial collection, MSW and special waste. It is encouraging to see our key volumes continue to grow, particularly MSW, which was up 5.7% in the quarter. While the roll-off business remained soft, the declines in volume showed sequential improvement. Similar to the residential business, we're making the right volume trade-offs as organic revenue grew in the quarter and operating EBITDA margin expanded. Churn was 9.2% in the quarter, which is similar to last year and validates the effectiveness of our customer lifetime value model. Service increases continue to outpace decreases, further reinforcing our execution. We remain confident that our data-driven business decisions and technology investments are leading to greater operational efficiency and improved return on capital, which is reflected in the growth and margin performance of our collection and disposal operations. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team again for their contributions. Their performance positions us for a strong year-end finish and sustained growth heading into 2025. And now I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our third quarter financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Our results underscore the effectiveness of our strategy to maximize customer lifetime value and drive operating efficiency. Our success is again evident in the operating EBITDA growth, which was 11% in the quarter and operating EBITDA margin, which reached an all-time high of 30.5%. This result was at the low end of our projection of 30.5% to 31% for the quarter due to higher-than-expected recycling commodity prices. When considering about 20 basis points of margin pressure from higher recycled commodity prices, we see the 90 basis points of margin expansion is a strong result that was right at the middle of our guidance range. This highlights that margin expansion from organic growth and cost optimization met our expectations. Once again, margin expansion was driven by the collection and disposal business. Our disciplined pricing strategy, intentional shedding of low-margin residential volume, improved employee retention benefits from truck deliveries and the use of technology to drive efficiency combined to deliver 140 basis points of margin growth in the third quarter. The 50 basis point offset relates to higher incentive compensation costs. These results have been driven by robust operating -- they have driven robust operating and free cash flow growth as well. We generated $3.88 billion of cash from operations through the first nine months of 2024, an increase of more than 16% compared to the same period in 2023. With capital expenditures tracking according to plan across the business and proceeds from the divestiture of non-strategic assets a little ahead of our plan, we've grown free cash flow by 20%. Our outlook for the full year is strong, with operating EBITDA toward the high end of expectations being the driver. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion for the year. The increase of about $50 million from our prior guidance relates to continued progress on the development of our sustainability growth investments. Additionally, we continue to expect $145 million of investment tax credits in 2024 from our renewable natural gas projects. Putting all of this together, we're on pace to achieve the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance for the year of $2.15 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're well-positioned to fund the acquisition of Stericycle. As a reminder, we have suspended our share buyback program because of the current focus on M&A growth including the pending Stericycle acquisition and the nearly $800 million core solid waste acquisitions completed through the end of the third quarter. We remain committed to a disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we prioritize a strong investment-grade credit rating. Organic and inorganic long-term strategic growth and strong shareholder returns through dividends and prudent share repurchases. With three quarters of the year complete, we're confident that we will meet or exceed the high end of our 2024 guidance for revenue and free cash flow. And we will deliver about $6.5 billion of operating EBITDA, representing a growth rate of about 10%. This strong finish to 2024 will create momentum that we expect to carry into our 2025 plan. When you combine our solid waste growth with an increase in earnings contributions from sustainability projects and the expected benefits from adding the Stericycle business to our portfolio, we expect the year ahead to be one of standout performance. Thanks to the efforts of 48,000 plus team members across WM who are working hard to deliver on all of our strategic priorities, we're bullish about the future at WM. We want to thank the team for all they do. We look forward to delivering on our targets for 2024 as we close out the remainder of the year. With that, Livia, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question coming from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. Your line is open.\nTyler Brown: Hi, good morning. So I think back in '23, you guys did call it, $40 million of renewable segment EBITDA, but do you guys still feel comfortable that you'll be run rating somewhere around $300 million in sustainability EBITDA here in Q4? And can you guys give us any color, just big picture on how much incremental EBITDA comes from that segment in '25. I think you guys had mentioned that you would be run rating at maybe $0.5 billion by the end of '25. Does that all still seem good or has that been pushed a little bit to the right?\nTara Hemmer: So I can take this one. This is Tara Hemmer. You'll recall during our last call, $800 million is what we plan to deliver in 2027, and we had pushed that out. If you look at the earnings contribution for 2024 from the sustainability-related businesses, we're expecting that to be in the $120 million to $130 million range for 2024. And you'll recall, we had originally guided $115 million plus another $15 million coming from commodity prices in the recycling business. Related to what we expect to deliver in 2025, what we can tell you really qualitatively is a little bit of the pieces. We certainly expect higher EBITDA growth as these plants come online, not just on the RNG space, but also the recycling space. And we're going to expect lower CapEx in 2025. So when you put those pieces together, you'll expect greater flow-through. The other thing we should mention is we are expecting slightly higher CapEx for the program. Originally, we had said between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, and we're now expecting about $3 billion. So all in all, we do expect 2025 to be a significant year for our sustainability-related investments. It's a bit premature for us to give you all the pieces for 2025 based on where things may shake out related to the completion of the plants in Q4 of 2024. And then also, of course, we're tracking closely commodity prices. So we'll give more of an update in early 2025.\nDevina Rankin: And Tyler, with regard to the segment reporting, the one thing I would just clarify is, there's some additional details that we provided in the current press release that will give color to some of the mechanics associated with the collection and disposal business and their contribution to the earnings growth of the sustainability investment portfolio that Tara talked about. And I think it's important to look at those details to see the total picture.\nTara Hemmer: And if you look at those details, what you'll see is year-to-date, we've delivered $92 million EBITDA.\nTyler Brown: And then Tara, just on the CapEx. So I think if I take the $950 million, and I think you've already spent, call it, 1.4 billion. So your already, I think, by the end of '24, call it, 2.3. So that implies maybe another $700 million. Is that mostly in 2025, so it steps down in 2025 and then a big step down in 2026? Or is that going to be maybe more pro rata between the two.\nTara Hemmer: Absolutely. You have that right. You have the pieces right.\nTyler Brown: Okay. Okay. Perfect. And just my last one, Jim. So I know you guys don't give a ton of color on the out year, but you did mention that, again, you're kind of set up for an outsized growth in 2025, and we're in the business of splitting hairs. So I just want to kind of understand exactly what you mean by that. So I think of you guys as a 5% to 7% organic EBITDA grower and then we add something for M&A and renewables. So when you say an outsized grower, is that in context to that 5% to 7% organically? Or are you just simply saying that, that growth can be north of 5% to 7% with Stericycle and renewables? Just any additional color would be super helpful.\nJim Fish: Yes. So the 5% to 7% is a number that we gave in 2019 with Investor Day, and we've actually been -- over the last couple of years, been outperforming that organically. But if you -- the reason we're as excited as we are about 2025, 2026, 2027 is that when you look at a couple of things. First of all, you look at -- you just talked through with Tara, the sustainability investments. As she said, CapEx, you had the numbers just about exactly right. We probably have about $700 million left in CapEx, maybe a little bit more than that. And most of that happens next year. So you can expect to see a pretty substantial uptick in free cash -- in the free cash flow component. And when I say most of that occurs next year, that is still lower in terms of CapEx than this year because this year is going to be call it, $900 million for those sustainability investments. Next year will be something lower than that. And then 2026 will be significantly lower than that in terms of CapEx. And at the same time, you see the EBITDA really, really kicking up. We do have most of these plants, it seems rolling on in the fourth quarter. So we're not getting the impact of EBITDA in that year. This year is no exception to that with four of the five coming online in the fourth quarter. Kind of the same thing for next year. A number of plants are coming online in the fourth quarter. But we do fully expect to see $800 million by the time we -- the first full year of that will be 2027. You add to that Stericycle, we've had 4.5 months to look at it. We're even more enthusiastic about the strategic side of Stericycle than we were when we announced this 4.5 months ago. Rafael and his team have had a lot of opportunity to look into this. In addition to looking at their core business, which we said four months ago was really just kind of a fourth line of business for us, and we now believe that even more after spending 4.5 months on it. The synergies piece, which we said initially, we thought might be $125 million over three years. We now are pretty convinced that, that's a conservative number. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be yet, and we'll give you more insight into that with guidance in 2025. But look, I mean, the best example is SG&A. We baked in about $40 million worth of SG&A synergies there in the original $125 million. And that takes their SG&A number from 22% of revenue down to 19%. We're reporting 8.9% ourselves today, so you can understand our optimism around synergies. And then John talked a lot about the use of technology. It's something that we probably five years ago, started recognizing that there was -- particularly with these trade type positions, there was kind of an impending shortage coming. And so we started investing in technology to -- when those positions would attrit away from us that we wouldn't have to replace them, that we would use technology. And hence, the investments that we've made over the last five years in technology. And those have really all started to show up. You've heard John talk a lot about, I think, you said four consecutive quarters of sub-61% OpEx as a percent of revenue. That is largely driven by our pricing programs, but also by our cost improvement on the efficiency side. You combine all of those plus still a pretty robust market out there for tuck-in acquisitions. And you can see why we're really, really optimistic. No matter what happens with the election, no matter what happens with the economy, barring a disastrous geopolitical events, we're very optimistic about 2025, 2026, 2027.\nTyler Brown: Great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nToni Kaplan: Thank you so much. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the revenue guidance raise. I know you don't give guidance quarterly, but 3Q was a little bit stronger than, I guess, what I was expecting. And so was the raise driven by 3Q performance? And why not? Is there anything that leads you to expect the momentum you had in the quarter won't continue into 4Q. It doesn't sound like it. So I just wanted to understand what was going into the thought process there? Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: So you're right that the third quarter was an outsized performance on the revenue line, and that and that really came from two things. It was recycled commodity prices and landfill volumes. We're optimistic that the landfill volume contribution continues into the fourth quarter. There wasn't anything specific or unusual about that growth. It's some strong market performance in kind of the Midwest part of our company and really good contribution margin from that business. The recycling commodity price piece of it is recycling brokerage contribution and with the port strike impacts that we saw late in the third quarter and some continuing uncertainty associated with those impacts going into fourth quarter. We're less optimistic that you'll see upside to recycling commodity prices continue into the quarter ahead or into 2025 at this point, it's too early for us to say. So really happy with the core business performance and the contributors from collection and disposal specifically, a little more cautious with regard to the recycling commodity price piece. So that is the lower flow-through part of the business, which is why we're still confident in the EBITDA contribution of that revenue growth.\nJim Fish: And I think, Devina, we had a little bit of an offset from lower electricity pricing that hit the top-line for the quarter. So that would tell you that -- it's part of why we were as pleased with the performance at 7.9% growth there on the top-line. I think what it tells us, as we look out to 2025, is that there aren't any storm clouds on the horizon with respect to the economy. It's so hard to tell these days. Obviously, in an election year, it's really hard to tell because both sides are kind of giving their own talking points. But we're not seeing anything that would indicate storm clouds on the horizon for us. We feel like the economy is on relatively good footing.\nToni Kaplan: Yes. That sounds great. I wanted to ask also on an update on the price cost spread and how you're thinking about how that progresses in the next few quarters? Thanks.\nJohn Morris: Yes. Toni, I think certainly, we're pleased. As I said in my prepared remarks, we remain on track with regard to our pricing objectives for the year. A few things I would point out is when you look at the spread to our you see that CPI is down, again, about 120 basis points for the quarter and 160 basis points year-to-date. And if you compare that to our core price and yield numbers, I think it tells a good story. And then to the comments you heard from Jim and Devina and I had shown up certainly in the margin. So long story short, we feel good about the kind of disciplined approach we're taking to pricing. The customer value lifetime model we're using from a data and analytics standpoint and when you look at -- as I mentioned, when you look at the spread, it continues to show up in OpEx and in margin.\nJim Fish: And I think, too, John, the -- we've talked to Toni, a lot about 5,000 to 7,000 jobs kind of trading away from us. I mentioned it just briefly in response to Tyler's question. We're at about 2200, a little bit more than that 2241 to be precise since 2022, positions that we have chosen to not refill that left us via attrition and we've chosen not to refill those -- and we think, John, another potentially 3,000 so call it, fourth or fifth inning to use the baseball analogy is about where we are now, most of those coming out through recycling automation and then through this conversion from traditional rear load to automated side load.\nJohn Morris: Toni, the one final point I might make is while inflation is generally coming down, we're not seeing that with our frontline wages and that's part of the reason why you hear so much conviction about the continued investments in automation and technology, whether it's core business, whether it's recycling facilities, we're still seeing 4.5% to 5.5% on general wage inflation with those frontline roles. In fact, we heard from one of our AVPs during the quarterly reviews that we're hiring technicians, and that number starts with a four now and it's going to start with a five in terms of the rate per hour. So when you look at the investments we're making to try to be a little less labor dependent through attrition, as Jim mentioned, it kind of gives us that much more conviction about those investments.\nToni Kaplan: Terrific. Thanks for the color and congrats on the quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is coming from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Hi. Good morning everyone. For those of us New Yorkers on the line, we'll ask for no more baseball analogies, please. So congratulations on the strong results. I just wanted to talk about the returns that we're seeing on recycling investments, is it possible just to get a sense for the savings per plant that we're budgeting in the program? What are we seeing as the plants are coming online. Typically, when you folks make these automation moves. We've seen the results of price on the upside. I'm wondering, is that starting to play out? And how should we be thinking about the per plant economics versus what you folks underwrote at the beginning of the program.\nTara Hemmer: Well, what we can tell you is we're tracking a couple of key metrics. The first and we've said this consistently, the labor cost per ton is really in that 30% improvement range and that is consistent across all of our plants. The other thing that we're seeing is roughly 17% higher blended value on the commodities we sell. We're creating a cleaner product, and this is really important. If you think about the commodity prices that we're at today and we're expecting to end the year around $90 a ton. Our investment thesis was $1.25. So getting a higher blended value on our commodities is very important, and that's been proven out. The other thing that we track is our gross operating expenses, and those are also 17% improvement across the portfolio of automation plants. And then the other point that we don't talk about as much is volume. And we are seeing a volume growth story coming out of these investments, which was a pivotal piece of what we were going to be really offering to the communities that we have these investments in. And Q3 was one of the first quarters where we've seen that volume growth because we've had some impacts related to shutdowns. So we'll see that transfer across each year. So when you stack those together, we're seeing strong margin improvement on our recycling plants across the portfolio.\nJim Fish: And that volume, Tara, is really a function of the plant processing faster, correct?\nTara Hemmer: Exactly. So plants processing faster. We're also expanding the size of some of these plants as we're building them. And it's been a great story when we look at one of the markets John is going to be visiting later today in Minneapolis, where we've seen really, really strong volume growth in that market and then also EBITDA performance.\nDevina Rankin: I think it's really important to pull all of that together. Tara outlined all of the contributing factors. When we look at the thing that made us so confident in this investment strategy, it really was the payback period of the recycling investments relative to investments we make in our traditional collection and disposal assets. And we've always talked about the recycling investments being one of the best return on invested capital that we have across our portfolio. And we are seeing that not just hold, but accelerate. So we're really happy to see payback periods in that six to seven year range. And we've got confidence that with some of the outsized performance, particularly on throughput and volume, as Tara outlined, it's actually going to be better than what we had planned when we built the strategy despite the lower commodity price values.\nJerry Revich: Super. And then in terms of the landfill gas facilities that are coming online, roughly speaking of spot market economics, I think that would imply roughly $150 million to $200 million in incremental EBITDA 2025 versus 2024 from these plants. Anything we should keep in mind in terms of your contracting strategy or any other moving pieces as we think about that 2025 versus 2024 bridge on that part of the investment?\nTara Hemmer: Sure. I'm glad you brought that up because I think there's a tendency to look at the spot market prices for RINs. And just a reminder, we are taking a portfolio-based view of our RNG that we're producing. And one of the things that we outlined was to really work on contracting more of our volume. So today, we are at about 40% for 2025, and we expect to expand that over the balance of Q4 going into early 2025. And that is a mix of long-term offtake in the voluntary market with utilities and also our ability to forward sell 2025 RINs, and we've been able to do that successfully. So that gives us confidence in really any political environment, whether or not Trump or Harris gets elected, we're seeing strong forward selling on 2025 RINs.\nJim Fish: It's probably also worth mentioning that just for everyone's kind of clarification on the plants themselves, we tend to think that once the CapEx stops and once the construction is complete, that all of a sudden, these are starting to produce revenue and EBITDA. And there are multiple steps afterwards that are largely outside of our control, the commissioning of the plant, in many cases, the testing of the gas coming out of the plant and then the final step, which is EPA approval of that plant. And while we'd like to think that all of those move efficiently, it is government. So in many cases, so it doesn't always move as efficiently as we would or as quickly as we would like, which I think is a credit Tara to your team that we're able to get the -- as many plants as we have 20 plants and still stay relatively close to the time lines that we've broadcast, but there are multiple steps beyond just the construction phase.\nJerry Revich: Super. And Jim, can I ask you just one last one just to pull the thread on the Stericycle comments that you made earlier on the call. Can you just talk about over the course of diligence, what you folks think about the ability to implement lease management type pricing on that business and the ability to cross-sell. So very interesting to hear about the additional opportunity on the cost side. What do you think based on the diligence on the pricing part of equation?\nDevina Rankin: So as Jim mentioned earlier, all of our diligence and integration planning processes has really spoken to our bullishness with regard to the long-term strategic outlook of this business. With regard to pricing, what I would tell you, Jerry, is this integration planning hasn't been customer oriented. It's been more about bringing the two teams together, bringing our systems and processes together and thinking about how we can use the WM way of using technology to optimize our fleet using technology to optimize the back office in order to reduce the cost of serving in that business. We'll know more once the Stericycle team is part of WM about the runway and projections on revenue growth. But we still think that the overall investment thesis holds because we think that long-term medical waste is one of those parts of the U.S. economy where we're going to see an outsized growth.\nJohn Morris: Yes, Jerry, Devina touched on it, but I do think when you step back a little bit from it, it's there's elements of that business that fit very nicely over top of WM and if you kind of consider it a fourth line of collection business, right, in terms of trucks and maintenance and repair and labor and efficiency and all the things that we've talked to you folks about over the last couple of years, we think there's benefits down the road or we can overlay those investments and processes to drive some -- drive improvement on the operating side.\nJerry Revich: Appreciate the discussion. Thank you.\nJohn Morris: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye: Thanks very much. So in addition to Stericycle pending, you spent a lot on solid waste M&A this year. Can we talk a little bit about that, the types of businesses you're picking up? And then from a housekeeping standpoint, what the rollover contribution is on revenue for 2025 .\nJohn Morris: Yes, certainly. Yes. So we've had a strong year. We closed almost $800 million of acquisitions. I think on the last call we mentioned that we probably could be in the range of $1 billion. And we still feel good about the pipeline, whether that closes in Q4, it rolls a little bit into Q1 is yet to be determined, but we feel good about the pipeline and the deals that we have teed up I think important to note, we said this on the last call, there's a handful of markets we mentioned Arizona, the Carolinas, Florida and now the most recent acquisition of Winters Brothers in Long Island. Those are both represent not only good deals for us, but in strategic markets for a host of different reasons. So we feel really good about that. They're all performing very well to date and we're focused on trying to get the next handful of deals closed here in the next few months.\nDevina Rankin: And then, Noah, from a rollover perspective, we see about $150 million of rollover benefit to the revenue line, which we think will translate to about $35 million of EBITDA in 2025.\nNoah Kaye: Okay. Very helpful there. And then you know what, I'll just stick with short-term modeling housekeeping, so sort of 5% total revenue growth implied for 4Q, your yield trends should probably continue to be pretty healthy. You've got probably what, close to a point here on the M&A side. So it sounds like almost you think the volume could be kind of flattish. I know you had a tough comp because I think you had some cleanup volumes last year. But we also had some storms this year that might provide some opportunities. So just kind of baseline for us how you're thinking about organic trends for 4Q and whether there would be any upside to the volume side?\nDevina Rankin: So the volume story for 2024 has been one for us where the commercial collection business and MSW, which really speak to us about the general health of the overall economy has been really strong over the course of the year and consistent with expectations. The one soft spot for us has been those industrial hauls and they've been lighter than we expected and certainly, something that we hear in the marketplace about just a little more reservation on industrial investment in this environment. We think some of that could loosen up in the fourth quarter after there is clarity in the election, but yet to be determined and certainly not something that we're creating guidance outlook on. With respect to the revenue guide for the fourth quarter, it really isn't a volume story where we were reserved on top line relative to Q3, it was commodity price. And so I would tell you, the expectation is take those Q3 volumes that we saw and carry them into Q4 and early 2025 is what our outlook includes.\nNoah Kaye: All right, very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question, coming from the line of Kevin Chiang with CIBC. Your line is open.\nKevin Chiang: Hi and thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good Q3 print there. I was wondering if you could maybe provide any more color on the Canadian Competition Bureau review. It looks like it's the last one before you close on Stericycle. You've noted you feel comfortable you'll get that done in Q4 here. But just any color in terms of what they're looking at since they filed this? I think you do overlap on pharmaceutical destruction, but correct me if I'm wrong. Any color there would be helpful?\nDevina Rankin: So I would say it's typical competition reviews in the Canada market, specifically, nothing that concerns us with regard to the pathway to getting to close and I just have to say thank you to all of our team members who have been working really diligently both the legal team and the Canada operations leadership in order to work through these processes. And we're optimistic that we're going to be able to get that clearance here yet in the fourth quarter and move quickly to close.\nKevin Chiang: That's helpful. And my second one here, good progress on these cost initiatives. If I look at your OpEx line items, a lot of them, if I look at it from a an intensity perspective, let's say, as a percentage of revenue, a lot of them are kind of back to where they were prior to this inflationary environment. Maybe the one thing that does stand out to me is maintenance and repairs tracking kind of mid- to high 9% as a percentage of revenue. I think we've seen that below 9% prior to the move in inflation. Just wondering if there's an opportunity to move that lower. Is there something structural there that keeps that a little bit more elevated in this new cost environment?\nJohn Morris: Yes, Kevin, I think that's fair. And you're starting to see, I think this quarter was a 40 basis point improvement in terms of maintenance and repairs. There's two sides to that. There's the fleet side and the non-fleet side. On the fleet side, we continue to -- a couple of things are benefiting us. One is truck deliveries have been more consistent now than they've really been since sort of pre-COVID. So it's allowing us to plan more strategically for assets coming into the system and going out of the system. I will add, when we talk about -- and this is a big part of our strategy, we talk about residential automation. The configuration of that vehicle replacing a rear loader can -- that truck day one is going to be more expensive to run than a traditional rear loader. But what's important to take away from that is we look at it both from an M&R perspective, but we also look at it from a total cost of operation on a per unit basis. So when you double plus the efficiency, we may be willing to pay more to maintain a more complicated vehicle with different technology in it if it's driving overall CPU performance, which you are seeing and you're clearly seeing it in the margins. In residential, I think I'm going off the top of my head here, but we were up about 300-plus basis points for the quarter on 2.9% less volume. And so when you wrap all that together, you're right, there are still opportunities in maintenance and repairs, but we do backstop that against sort of our overall total cost of operation goals.\nDevina Rankin: And year-to-date, our maintenance and repairs costs in this environment are flat effectively on a dollar basis. So it's a good indication of getting leverage off of the truck deliveries, and we expect that momentum to continue into the year ahead.\nKevin Chiang: That\u2019s great color. Thank you very much for taking my questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Trevor Romeo with William Blair. Your line is open.\nTrevor Romeo: Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much for taking the questions here. I thought maybe it was worth going back to the strong landfill volume growth in the quarter. Total depletable tons up 4%, the MSW up almost 6%. I think that was the strongest you've seen in a while. Devina, I think you mentioned there was some strength in the Midwest. But I was just wondering if you could talk about those landfill dynamics a bit more. Was there anything kind of unusual or onetime in the quarter?\nJohn Morris: Trevor, I would tell you, we saw a pretty consistent landfill performance through most of the organization. We pointed out there was three or four areas sort of in the middle of the country, if you will, that were the ones that drove the outside performance. One in particular is now a rail served operation that we got opened last year, and we're starting to see continued volume growth there, and that was a chunk of it. That really speaks to sort of the network planning aspect of what we do with our post-collection sites, and you folks have heard us talk about that a good bit. So one of the slugs, if you will, volume that helped us in the last couple of quarters is us opening up another intermodal facility in the Midwest. I think Jim commented too, our special waste volumes were strong and a good part of that volume was flowing through a handful of those same regions in the middle of the country.\nTrevor Romeo: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up on the sustainability CapEx sounds like that's going to come in a little bit higher than you anticipated earlier this year, the $950 million this year and then the $3 billion total. Just wondering, is the increase mostly related to cost inflation or something else there? Just any more details on what's driving that? Thank you.\nTara Hemmer: It's a mix, primarily on the renewable natural gas side related to cost inflation on the construction of the plants and then also some higher cost on utility interconnects and those utility interconnects are for our electrical interconnect and our natural gas interconnect. So it's really those two categories.\nDevina Rankin: And then I would say the 2024 increase specifically relates to our intentional acceleration in some of the spending into Q4 as we complete these projects and accelerate the ongoing capital investment at the remaining portfolio. So that is really timing related. It's not an indication of the inflation that Tara spoke to.\nJim Fish: But we're still on track, though to -- we said last quarter, we expected by the end of this year, we would have spent about 75% of the total capital. That is still the case, almost right at 75%. And then because of the lag, of course, we won't have realized the EBITDA. We will only have realized about 15%, a little bit more, about 15% or 16% of the EBITDA of that $800 million. So that's part of why we're so encouraged about 2025, 2026 and 2027 is that you really start to see not only the EBITDA growth, but also the free cash flow growth because the CapEx really goes away after -- for the most part goes away after next year and EBITDA really ticks up free cash.\nTrevor Romeo: Yes. Makes a lot of sense. Thank you everyone. Appreciate it.\nJim Fish: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of David Manthey with Baird. Your line is open.\nDavid Manthey: Thank you. Good morning. It was asked earlier, and I'm not sure if I caught it, but did you quantify your expectations for the net impact from hurricanes in fourth quarter and into 2025? Or could you?\nJohn Morris: Yes, David. There's nothing right now that we've quantified for the balance of year or obviously 2025. These storms were obviously historic in a lot of ways, but first and foremost, our people are safe. Our assets were largely untouched first and foremost. In terms of the cleanup, we continue to talk the teams across the Southeast and specifically Florida. There may be some benefit down the road here, but I don't think it's going to be similar to anything we saw with Hurricane Ian, for example. But there's nothing in our outlook right now regarding any volume we would potentially get from those events.\nDavid Manthey: Okay. Thank you. And second, is the industrial vertical potential source of upside for you as we get into next year. So if industrial production starts growing low single digits, like maybe we saw in 2012 or 2018 coming out of a downturn, would you expect industrial volume growth to turn positive in that type of environment?\nJim Fish: It's hard to say whether it would turn positive. But certainly, this quarter, we reported negative 4.1% for the roll-off line of business that -- and we've been pretty consistently in that negative 3.5% to negative 4.5% range. It does tell us that while the overall economy has been pretty healthy. The industrial economy, not so much, and that's a good -- that's been not a good, but certainly it's been sign of that. I think you can expect to start to see that come back. Now will it go positive? Don't know. That's a big number to make up. But I would expect that we'll start to see industrial come back. And by the time we get through the election cycle, there's -- the uncertainty is kind of out of the system, then I think we could start to see the industrial economy pick back up.\nDevina Rankin: And from a macro perspective, I do think some of the interest rate environment will be an interesting watch point for us with things like housing starts lagging recently. And if you could start to see some momentum there, although news out this morning isn't all that favorable. So it's one of the things that we have our eye on because this really is about the temporary side of the industrial part of the business rather than the permanent side.\nJim Fish: On the other line of business, of course, that's been negative has been residential. So -- and that's more by design and that was down 2.9% for the quarter. It's been down in that range for, I don't know, John, two years. And I think John has been asked the question before, when do you expect that to get back to more of a breakeven. If that is by design, he even mentioned it in his script that we're some of the -- we're letting some of the business go that has been underperforming business. That's been ongoing for two or three years now. John, it's probably safe to say that we could expect to get back to flat maybe in the end of '25, early '26. Is that fair?\nJohn Morris: Yes. I mean the team has done a great job. We've got a really healthy inventory of contracts that are not performing up to par. And I think we'll continue to see -- it moderated a bit, if you look at year-to-date quarter-over-quarter a bit. But when you look, Jim, at the benefits from efficiency, safety and overall margin improvement, we're going to stay on this path until that line of business competes with the other collection lines, which has been kind of our mission since day 1.\nDavid Manthey: All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question, coming from the line of Konark Gupta with Scotiabank. Your line is open.\nKonark Gupta: Thanks for taking my question and echo my congratulations on a good quarter. I wanted to follow up on sustainability CapEx. So just like two parts maybe there. I think if I remember correctly, your original $2.2 billion CapEx envelope was, I think, 50-50 RNG and recycling. Today, that's about $3 billion total. What's the split like between RNG and recycling there? And then I think you mentioned that 75% of the CapEx will be done by the end of this year, is 75% of the $3 billion, that's a new number or that's $2.2 million.\nTara Hemmer: Yes. So the original number, the breakdown was roughly $1.2 billion from renewable energy and $1 billion from recycling. And so today, the increased number to $3 billion the 75% is based on the $3 billion and the split is roughly $1.4 billion for recycling and 1.6 for renewable energy.\nJim Fish: Portion of that difference, though, Tara, is -- I mean, some of it's inflation, but a portion of it is, for example, in Ontario, right? I mean it's new plants. So it's not really an apples-to-apples when you compare the $3 billion to the $2.2 billion, a piece of it is that's related to inflation, but a piece of it is adding new facilities.\nTara Hemmer: Adding new facilities. That's a great point, Jim. And also, we changed the plants within the renewable energy portfolio, so the plan slightly different. And that's one of the reasons, if you go back to the Investor Day deck, we were projecting $740 million in EBITDA, and that got moved to $800 million. So it's one of the reasons why that was more contact setting if you go back to the Investor Day, but the numbers that we've outlined and the mix of plants on both sides are different.\nKonark Gupta: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And if I can quickly follow up on housekeeping on margin side of things, so 3.5% was a great number for Q3. Obviously, your implied Q4 is about 30%, call it, maybe you can do a little bit better there. But exiting '24, you're looking at 30-ish kind of margin right now. knowing what you know today and like post-election, clarity, et cetera, is it fair to expect that your margins can trend sort of in line with what you have seen historically in terms of expansion in 2025 organically, excluding Stericycle?\nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question, and thank you for excluding Stericycle because it's too early for us to say. But so what I would tell you is over the long term, we've targeted 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business. And when we look ahead, all the conversation about the strong execution on efficiency and retention that have driven the best operating expense as a percentage of revenue really that we've seen in our company's history, we expect that to continue, and we expect that to be a driver of continued growth in the year ahead. So one caveat that I have to that, and it is an important one because it's larger for us than it is for our competitors, is there is the expiration of the alternative fuel tax credit in 2025. That's about $60 million of EBITDA and a 30 basis point headwind to margin in the year ahead. So the 50 to 100, I would tell you, bring down by that 30 basis points for the range. But we're targeting that same execution for 2025. And then when we look at the sustainability businesses, that's incremental upside for us. And we see the sustainability businesses -- the renewable energy business provided 30 basis points of margin expansion for us in the third quarter of 2024. And we think when we look ahead, to a full year contribution from the five facilities that Jim and Tara have talked about bringing online by the end of 2024, we see another 30 basis points of expansion from this level.\nKonark Gupta: That\u2019s great. I'll leave it there. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of James Schumm with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJames Schumm: Hi. Good morning. Thanks guys. So you touched on this, but now that you've had some more time to spend on Stericycle, I'm wondering if there's a reason why this business might require a structurally higher SG&A cost structure as a percentage of sales relative to WM?\nDevina Rankin: So I think it's really a great point, and it's one that we're not taking for granted. And I think it's their ERP journey is one that has gotten a lot of attention, rightfully so, both internally and externally and bringing all of their disparate businesses onto a single platform has been a significant undertaking, and we're commending them for all of that hard work and that effort. What I would tell you is that when you have that kind of an undertaking for call it, a $2.5 billion to $3 billion revenue business and you compare that to a similar undertaking for a $20 billion-plus business, that's one of the things that will be structurally different between the two. And we anticipated that when we evaluated the acquisition opportunity. That really is the one that we think stands out. The rest of it, we think there's tremendous opportunity and upside to use the WM Way, so to speak, in order to optimize SG&A as a percentage of revenue long term.\nJim Fish: Well, you've said before, Devina, that's really the ultimate comparison. Once you get past the ERP rollout, the ultimate comparison would be to one of our areas as opposed to our corporate SG&A, which came in at 8.9%. And our areas, James, operated 5%. So it's why we're enthusiastic about what SG&A as a percent of revenue can look like for us and what the synergies are associated with that. I think Tara makes the right point about -- not Tara, Devina makes the right point about the ERP and that having to get fully rolled out and there being costs associated with that. But once that is complete, then there's no reason to start that we wouldn't start to think about the Stericycle arm of our business looking more like one of our areas.\nJames Schumm: With respect to OCC, can you update us on the portion of the value that, that makes up in your recycling revenues? And has that changed at all with your new recycling facility upgrades?\nTara Hemmer: So it represents about 55% to 60% of our overall blended value. And what has changed over time with our automated investment is we're able to capture a bit more OCC through some of the quality improvements that we've made in our plans and move really more of our mixed paper to a higher-value product. So that's been a real bright spot for us when you think about our automation investments.\nJames Schumm: Thank you, Tara. And just to clarify. So OCC and mixed paper sort of office paper that all sort of -- are you saying like the fiber base is 55% to 60% of the value or just OCC.\nTara Hemmer: Yes.\nJames Schumm: All together.\nTara Hemmer: Yes.\nJames Schumm: Just OCC specifically. Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist Securities. Your line is open.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you. If the normalization process for fleet supply chain and employee retention has normally played out. Do you think there's an incremental opportunity for retention to improve further into next year? And I was hoping you could contrast the company's experience with what you're seeing in fleet, supply chain and employee retention and sort of labor expense in the potential acquisition targets that you look at.\nJohn Morris: Yes, it's a good point. I think, as I mentioned earlier, the fact that we frankly have a stability in our fleet delivery schedule we haven't had in a number of years is really paying dividends, not just on total M&R as percentage or CPU, but also in our ability to really manage our asset base better and make sure that we're optimizing the number of assets we have in this case vehicles. I mentioned the one area of pressure, we still see specific to M&R and really across labor is still wage pressure. That's probably in the 4.5% to 5.5%, maybe 6% in some markets. So we continue to obviously make the necessary adjustments there. And I think the punch line is our retention for drivers and technicians is around 19%. It's a little lower for drivers, little higher for technicians. But even in that environment, we're still bringing the defection of our employees down, which is obviously having a big benefit. And then lastly, with respect to the -- some of the operations we've purchased, I mentioned a few that we've done this year. While they've been really, really well-run companies, I think one of the places we get leverage out of is what you've heard Jim and Devina I referenced, which is sort of our WM Way playbook. And we see that as a way to capture additional value when we go into even a well-run operation. But we put the strength of our supply chain, our operating team and all the tools and technology they come with. That's one of the areas we continue to see upside.\nTobey Sommer: Thanks. And with -- what are your thoughts about incremental investments into harvesting the remaining MMBtus in the company's portfolio, understanding that near-term, you've got cash uses related to acquisition-led growth that may mean it's not sort of a near-term choice.\nTara Hemmer: So we've actively looked at and we have a beat on how much landfill gas that we have that we could really convert into R&D through new investments. And it's important to note the first 20 that we built, they tend to be larger plants where we had more landfill gas. So we're taking a much more prescriptive approach on the next tranche and really evaluating whether or not we should be developing them ourselves or perhaps leveraging a partner for those. That's something we'll likely make a decision on in 2025.\nDevina Rankin: I think it's really important to make a statement about the cash flow generation power of this business. While we're going to see a step change in our leverage with the closing of the Stericycle acquisition, we expect to return to target leverage ratios within 18 to 24 months of closing the transaction. And really, when you step back and look at the fact that before adding Stericycle to WM and before the step change that we're talking about coming in 2027 in free cash flow associated with the sustainability businesses, we're generating over $3 billion annually in free cash flow. And so that indicates our ability to use, call it, $6 billion over a 2-year period in order to meet the dividend and then have substantial free cash flow for the benefit of growth, for the benefit of balance sheet rationalization, it just speaks to the strong fundamentals of this business and our ability to have strategic runway in the sustainability business if we continue to see the return profile of those opportunities present themselves at the highest and best use of our funds.\nTobey Sommer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question coming from Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks and good morning. Just a quick question on the investment tax credits related to a lot of these investments. Our understanding is these are sort of being accrued. Is there any risk to those with the change in administration? Or just kind of if you can highlight the process to getting those paid or just guaranteed? Thanks.\nDevina Rankin: Yes. So we're not thinking about there being risk associated with the change in administration. But that certainly is something that could be on the table, but it's very difficult for us to be able to project. But with regard to what we've been accruing, there's $145 million in 2024, and that's showing up both as a reduction in cash taxes and a reduction in our provision on the income statement. We see the downside risk associated with really two things. One is solely timing. And if we saw one of our projects slip into 2025 in the first quarter. We wouldn't get that [technical difficulty] the complexity of the IRA and specifically, the applicability of the domestic content rules. We've evaluated those, and we think that the team is doing all of the right work, but the devils in the details when it comes to tax legislation. And so while we think we've done the right thing, it will come down to interpretation. We've taken that that into account as well in providing our guidance, but won't be finalized within a year. That will be something that continues as we have the IRS review our findings.\nTara Hemmer: And just as a reminder, that last part that Devina mentioned, it's the difference between 30% and 40%. And so we're confident we would get the 30%. It's really just the difference between 30% and 40% on ITC.\nSabahat Khan: Great. I appreciate that color. And then just a question as a follow-up to the earlier discussion around base business margin improvement and the offsetting impact from Stericycle. I guess as you get a closer look at the business, would you come back maybe after it closes potentially Q4 reporting and maybe give a path towards how long it may take to get consolidated margins sort of back in positive territory? Or is that something may evolve over a few years? Just trying to get an understanding of how you think about consolidated margins and the journey over the next couple of two to three years or however you look at it? Thanks.\nJim Fish: Yes. I think what we'll do is -- I mean there -- I believe the last I looked, their margins are kind of in the 16%, 17% range, something like that. So -- and when you start looking at the opportunities we have with synergies. We have not, as Devina said earlier, had a chance to look at their customer base at all. So we don't know what that means in terms of cross-selling or any of the top line. But we do think that we can improve it from where it is today, their margins are today because of those things. I think it will take us at least until February to be able to assess what Stericycle we think will look like for -- obviously, for 2025, but into 2026, 2027. When we'll be able to get back to kind of 30% on a combined basis is a little hard to say. As Devina said, you do have something working in our favor, which is the sustainability businesses and then our own improvement through the use of technology, and John has gone through a lot of the operating improvements. So you've got things working in both directions. I think it's very hard to say what the margin will be right now. But I think when we get to February and we give guidance, we can give you a better idea of that.\nSabahat Khan: Great. Thanks very much for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. One maybe high-level strategic question for me. I appreciate maybe the incremental commentary provided about the updated productivity at your new recycling facilities, whether it's productivity or throughput or the like. Is there any way you could then frame what some of these facilities are doing from a margin standpoint? Obviously, it wouldn't be completely apples-to-apples given allocating corporate costs, but just so we can think about truly what the margin differential is kind of pre and post upgrades? Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: So rather than give you specific margins on the business, what I think is important is that we bring it all together and say from a return on invested capital perspective and a margin expansion perspective, we've effectively seen a 10 percentage point increase in the margin of the business post automation, and that's a really strong indication of the power of the technology. And whether that be top line growth or middle of the P&L management cost reduction, we're seeing the benefits on each part of the model, and that's about a 10 percentage point lift in margin.\nStephanie Moore: Great. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up. On OCC pricing expectations for the fourth quarter, what are your underlying assumptions embedded in those?\nTara Hemmer: Our underlying assumptions for our blended commodity basket in Q4 is $85 a ton.\nStephanie Moore: Got it. All right. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Last question is coming from the line of Brian Butler with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrian Butler: Hi. Good morning, Waste Management. Thanks for fitting me in.\nTara Hemmer: Good morning.\nBrian Butler: Just one last quick one, I guess, on the commodity side. Now that you've kind of improved the facilities in automation, do you have a sensitivity to commodity price? So if that $85 changes, how should we think about the impact on maybe an annualized EBITDA?\nTara Hemmer: Well, the way to think about it, and we've said this previously, is about 60% of the benefit related to our automation plans is really independent of commodity prices, and that's the labor cost. That's the uplift that we get on blended values because we're producing a higher-quality product. And we're definitely seeing those flow through when we bring these automated plants online. So there's less of a sensitivity to commodity prices, but there still is a sensitivity that exists in the business.\nBrian Butler: Okay. And then I guess on the automation side, on the automated routes, you talked about 800 routes over the last couple of years being automated. Can you put that in perspective, how many more routes could be automated and how long would something like that take?\nJohn Morris: I think we've got about 11 more 100 routes that are eligible to be automated. And I would tell you, it's at least two years and probably into the third year before we cycle through all of them. But as I mentioned, I mean, from an efficiency margin safety standpoint, go down the list, we're even though we're trading off a little bit of volume, it's obviously from an investment perspective, been a fantastic effort by the team.\nJim Fish: Some of it, John, is a function of the contract itself. It's not necessarily getting the truck, but it's the contract expiration. If you've got a contract that is a three-year contract that is pick up everything contract and you're going to transition to an ASL contract that has to be negotiated by the public sector team and at the end of the existing good project.\nOperator: Thank you. And I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Fish, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.\nJim Fish: Okay. Well, thank you so much for your great questions today. We feel very good about the quarter. We feel very optimistic about the remainder of the year and into 2025, 2026, 2027. We're excited to be in this business at this point. But thank you very much. We will talk to you soon, and talk to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. Our quarterly results once again reflect robust operational performance in our collection and disposal business as well as our success executing on our strategic priorities. We're pleased to report another quarter of double-digit operating EBITDA growth, positioning us well to deliver about $6.5 billion for the full year, near the upper end of our guidance. Our cost optimization efforts and disciplined pricing programs together are increasing the spread between price growth and our cost to serve and our sustainability investments are providing margin accretive growth. As we'd anticipated, the third quarter set a new record for operating EBITDA margin at 30.5%, a year-over-year expansion of 90 basis points. This consistent growth underscores our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our shareholders. We remain focused on furthering our cost optimization efforts in collection and disposal in our collection and disposal business and improving frontline retention. And John will share more about the headway we're making here. Our teams are also hard at work integrating acquisitions in key markets and have closed nearly $800 million of solid waste acquisitions through the first nine months of the year with a strong pipeline of additional deals. We continue to progress towards closing the acquisition of Stericycle, which will add a complementary medical waste platform to our business and expand our suite service offerings. During the quarter, Stericycle shareholders approved the merger agreement. We received clearance from all international regulators, except for Canada, which is progressing. We're also advancing our integration planning, which has confirmed our confidence in the value of the Stericycle acquisition. We look forward to welcoming Stericycle team members to the WM team this quarter. Turning to recycling. During the quarter, we completed eight projects across our network, including six automation upgrades and new facilities in New York and Florida. Our team's focus on execution has been excellent with two of the projects completed in the quarter beginning operations ahead of plan. We've now completed 24 of the 39 projects in the growth program, which have added 1.5 million tons of annual recycling capacity across North America. Our automated recycling facilities are consistently delivering lower labor cost per ton and higher blended value on our commodity sales compared to our legacy plants, which translates into better operating EBITDA margins. In the renewable energy business, we remain on track to commission the four new renewable natural gas projects in the fourth quarter, adding to our DFW plants, which we brought online earlier this year. With these five projects, along with the two we completed prior to 2024, we will have seven of the 20 planned projects online by year-end. There are an additional 12 projects in active construction and the final plant will begin construction in early 2025. The seven projects are expected to contribute approximately 6 million MMBtus of annual production in 2025. Next year, is anticipated to be a pivotal year of contributions from renewable natural gas investments, and we're committed to scaling this unique opportunity to create long-term value for the environment and shareholders alike. We came into this year expecting strong execution across several fronts. And through the first nine months, we've delivered results that exceeded our own high expectations. As we look ahead to 2025, we anticipate continued growth in our solid waste business, increased contributions from our sustainability growth investments and the successful integration of the Stericycle business to come together to create a significant step change in revenue, earnings and free cash flow. I want to thank our dedicated team, whose hard work and commitment make all of this possible. And now, I'll turn the call over to John, who will provide a deeper dive into our operational results for the quarter. Yes. So the 5% to 7% is a number that we gave in 2019 with Investor Day, and we've actually been -- over the last couple of years, been outperforming that organically. But if you -- the reason we're as excited as we are about 2025, 2026, 2027 is that when you look at a couple of things. First of all, you look at -- you just talked through with Tara, the sustainability investments. As she said, CapEx, you had the numbers just about exactly right. We probably have about $700 million left in CapEx, maybe a little bit more than that. And most of that happens next year. So you can expect to see a pretty substantial uptick in free cash -- in the free cash flow component. And when I say most of that occurs next year, that is still lower in terms of CapEx than this year because this year is going to be call it, $900 million for those sustainability investments. Next year will be something lower than that. And then 2026 will be significantly lower than that in terms of CapEx. And at the same time, you see the EBITDA really, really kicking up. We do have most of these plants, it seems rolling on in the fourth quarter. So we're not getting the impact of EBITDA in that year. This year is no exception to that with four of the five coming online in the fourth quarter. Kind of the same thing for next year. A number of plants are coming online in the fourth quarter. But we do fully expect to see $800 million by the time we -- the first full year of that will be 2027. You add to that Stericycle, we've had 4.5 months to look at it. We're even more enthusiastic about the strategic side of Stericycle than we were when we announced this 4.5 months ago. Rafael and his team have had a lot of opportunity to look into this. In addition to looking at their core business, which we said four months ago was really just kind of a fourth line of business for us, and we now believe that even more after spending 4.5 months on it. The synergies piece, which we said initially, we thought might be $125 million over three years. We now are pretty convinced that, that's a conservative number. I don't know exactly what that number is going to be yet, and we'll give you more insight into that with guidance in 2025. But look, I mean, the best example is SG&A. We baked in about $40 million worth of SG&A synergies there in the original $125 million. And that takes their SG&A number from 22% of revenue down to 19%. We're reporting 8.9% ourselves today, so you can understand our optimism around synergies. And then John talked a lot about the use of technology. It's something that we probably five years ago, started recognizing that there was -- particularly with these trade type positions, there was kind of an impending shortage coming. And so we started investing in technology to -- when those positions would attrit away from us that we wouldn't have to replace them, that we would use technology. And hence, the investments that we've made over the last five years in technology. And those have really all started to show up. You've heard John talk a lot about, I think, you said four consecutive quarters of sub-61% OpEx as a percent of revenue. That is largely driven by our pricing programs, but also by our cost improvement on the efficiency side. You combine all of those plus still a pretty robust market out there for tuck-in acquisitions. And you can see why we're really, really optimistic. No matter what happens with the election, no matter what happens with the economy, barring a disastrous geopolitical events, we're very optimistic about 2025, 2026, 2027. And I think, Devina, we had a little bit of an offset from lower electricity pricing that hit the top-line for the quarter. So that would tell you that -- it's part of why we were as pleased with the performance at 7.9% growth there on the top-line. I think what it tells us, as we look out to 2025, is that there aren't any storm clouds on the horizon with respect to the economy. It's so hard to tell these days. Obviously, in an election year, it's really hard to tell because both sides are kind of giving their own talking points. But we're not seeing anything that would indicate storm clouds on the horizon for us. We feel like the economy is on relatively good footing. And I think, too, John, the -- we've talked to Toni, a lot about 5,000 to 7,000 jobs kind of trading away from us. I mentioned it just briefly in response to Tyler's question. We're at about 2200, a little bit more than that 2241 to be precise since 2022, positions that we have chosen to not refill that left us via attrition and we've chosen not to refill those -- and we think, John, another potentially 3,000 so call it, fourth or fifth inning to use the baseball analogy is about where we are now, most of those coming out through recycling automation and then through this conversion from traditional rear load to automated side load. And that volume, Tara, is really a function of the plant processing faster, correct? It's probably also worth mentioning that just for everyone's kind of clarification on the plants themselves, we tend to think that once the CapEx stops and once the construction is complete, that all of a sudden, these are starting to produce revenue and EBITDA. And there are multiple steps afterwards that are largely outside of our control, the commissioning of the plant, in many cases, the testing of the gas coming out of the plant and then the final step, which is EPA approval of that plant. And while we'd like to think that all of those move efficiently, it is government. So in many cases, so it doesn't always move as efficiently as we would or as quickly as we would like, which I think is a credit Tara to your team that we're able to get the -- as many plants as we have 20 plants and still stay relatively close to the time lines that we've broadcast, but there are multiple steps beyond just the construction phase. But we're still on track, though to -- we said last quarter, we expected by the end of this year, we would have spent about 75% of the total capital. That is still the case, almost right at 75%. And then because of the lag, of course, we won't have realized the EBITDA. We will only have realized about 15%, a little bit more, about 15% or 16% of the EBITDA of that $800 million. So that's part of why we're so encouraged about 2025, 2026 and 2027 is that you really start to see not only the EBITDA growth, but also the free cash flow growth because the CapEx really goes away after -- for the most part goes away after next year and EBITDA really ticks up free cash. Thank you. It's hard to say whether it would turn positive. But certainly, this quarter, we reported negative 4.1% for the roll-off line of business that -- and we've been pretty consistently in that negative 3.5% to negative 4.5% range. It does tell us that while the overall economy has been pretty healthy. The industrial economy, not so much, and that's a good -- that's been not a good, but certainly it's been sign of that. I think you can expect to start to see that come back. Now will it go positive? Don't know. That's a big number to make up. But I would expect that we'll start to see industrial come back. And by the time we get through the election cycle, there's -- the uncertainty is kind of out of the system, then I think we could start to see the industrial economy pick back up. On the other line of business, of course, that's been negative has been residential. So -- and that's more by design and that was down 2.9% for the quarter. It's been down in that range for, I don't know, John, two years. And I think John has been asked the question before, when do you expect that to get back to more of a breakeven. If that is by design, he even mentioned it in his script that we're some of the -- we're letting some of the business go that has been underperforming business. That's been ongoing for two or three years now. John, it's probably safe to say that we could expect to get back to flat maybe in the end of '25, early '26. Is that fair? Portion of that difference, though, Tara, is -- I mean, some of it's inflation, but a portion of it is, for example, in Ontario, right? I mean it's new plants. So it's not really an apples-to-apples when you compare the $3 billion to the $2.2 billion, a piece of it is that's related to inflation, but a piece of it is adding new facilities. Well, you've said before, Devina, that's really the ultimate comparison. Once you get past the ERP rollout, the ultimate comparison would be to one of our areas as opposed to our corporate SG&A, which came in at 8.9%. And our areas, James, operated 5%. So it's why we're enthusiastic about what SG&A as a percent of revenue can look like for us and what the synergies are associated with that. I think Tara makes the right point about -- not Tara, Devina makes the right point about the ERP and that having to get fully rolled out and there being costs associated with that. But once that is complete, then there's no reason to start that we wouldn't start to think about the Stericycle arm of our business looking more like one of our areas. Yes. I think what we'll do is -- I mean there -- I believe the last I looked, their margins are kind of in the 16%, 17% range, something like that. So -- and when you start looking at the opportunities we have with synergies. We have not, as Devina said earlier, had a chance to look at their customer base at all. So we don't know what that means in terms of cross-selling or any of the top line. But we do think that we can improve it from where it is today, their margins are today because of those things. I think it will take us at least until February to be able to assess what Stericycle we think will look like for -- obviously, for 2025, but into 2026, 2027. When we'll be able to get back to kind of 30% on a combined basis is a little hard to say. As Devina said, you do have something working in our favor, which is the sustainability businesses and then our own improvement through the use of technology, and John has gone through a lot of the operating improvements. So you've got things working in both directions. I think it's very hard to say what the margin will be right now. But I think when we get to February and we give guidance, we can give you a better idea of that. Some of it, John, is a function of the contract itself. It's not necessarily getting the truck, but it's the contract expiration. If you've got a contract that is a three-year contract that is pick up everything contract and you're going to transition to an ASL contract that has to be negotiated by the public sector team and at the end of the existing good project. Okay. Well, thank you so much for your great questions today. We feel very good about the quarter. We feel very optimistic about the remainder of the year and into 2025, 2026, 2027. We're excited to be in this business at this point. But thank you very much. We will talk to you soon, and talk to you next quarter."

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. Our results underscore the effectiveness of our strategy to maximize customer lifetime value and drive operating efficiency. Our success is again evident in the operating EBITDA growth, which was 11% in the quarter and operating EBITDA margin, which reached an all-time high of 30.5%. This result was at the low end of our projection of 30.5% to 31% for the quarter due to higher-than-expected recycling commodity prices. When considering about 20 basis points of margin pressure from higher recycled commodity prices, we see the 90 basis points of margin expansion is a strong result that was right at the middle of our guidance range. This highlights that margin expansion from organic growth and cost optimization met our expectations. Once again, margin expansion was driven by the collection and disposal business. Our disciplined pricing strategy, intentional shedding of low-margin residential volume, improved employee retention benefits from truck deliveries and the use of technology to drive efficiency combined to deliver 140 basis points of margin growth in the third quarter. The 50 basis point offset relates to higher incentive compensation costs. These results have been driven by robust operating -- they have driven robust operating and free cash flow growth as well. We generated $3.88 billion of cash from operations through the first nine months of 2024, an increase of more than 16% compared to the same period in 2023. With capital expenditures tracking according to plan across the business and proceeds from the divestiture of non-strategic assets a little ahead of our plan, we've grown free cash flow by 20%. Our outlook for the full year is strong, with operating EBITDA toward the high end of expectations being the driver. Total capital expenditures are expected to be $3.15 billion to $3.25 billion for the year. The increase of about $50 million from our prior guidance relates to continued progress on the development of our sustainability growth investments. Additionally, we continue to expect $145 million of investment tax credits in 2024 from our renewable natural gas projects. Putting all of this together, we're on pace to achieve the high end of our full year free cash flow guidance for the year of $2.15 billion. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we're well-positioned to fund the acquisition of Stericycle. As a reminder, we have suspended our share buyback program because of the current focus on M&A growth including the pending Stericycle acquisition and the nearly $800 million core solid waste acquisitions completed through the end of the third quarter. We remain committed to a disciplined approach to allocating capital, and we prioritize a strong investment-grade credit rating. Organic and inorganic long-term strategic growth and strong shareholder returns through dividends and prudent share repurchases. With three quarters of the year complete, we're confident that we will meet or exceed the high end of our 2024 guidance for revenue and free cash flow. And we will deliver about $6.5 billion of operating EBITDA, representing a growth rate of about 10%. This strong finish to 2024 will create momentum that we expect to carry into our 2025 plan. When you combine our solid waste growth with an increase in earnings contributions from sustainability projects and the expected benefits from adding the Stericycle business to our portfolio, we expect the year ahead to be one of standout performance. Thanks to the efforts of 48,000 plus team members across WM who are working hard to deliver on all of our strategic priorities, we're bullish about the future at WM. We want to thank the team for all they do. We look forward to delivering on our targets for 2024 as we close out the remainder of the year. With that, Livia, let's open the line for questions. And Tyler, with regard to the segment reporting, the one thing I would just clarify is, there's some additional details that we provided in the current press release that will give color to some of the mechanics associated with the collection and disposal business and their contribution to the earnings growth of the sustainability investment portfolio that Tara talked about. And I think it's important to look at those details to see the total picture. So you're right that the third quarter was an outsized performance on the revenue line, and that and that really came from two things. It was recycled commodity prices and landfill volumes. We're optimistic that the landfill volume contribution continues into the fourth quarter. There wasn't anything specific or unusual about that growth. It's some strong market performance in kind of the Midwest part of our company and really good contribution margin from that business. The recycling commodity price piece of it is recycling brokerage contribution and with the port strike impacts that we saw late in the third quarter and some continuing uncertainty associated with those impacts going into fourth quarter. We're less optimistic that you'll see upside to recycling commodity prices continue into the quarter ahead or into 2025 at this point, it's too early for us to say. So really happy with the core business performance and the contributors from collection and disposal specifically, a little more cautious with regard to the recycling commodity price piece. So that is the lower flow-through part of the business, which is why we're still confident in the EBITDA contribution of that revenue growth. I think it's really important to pull all of that together. Tara outlined all of the contributing factors. When we look at the thing that made us so confident in this investment strategy, it really was the payback period of the recycling investments relative to investments we make in our traditional collection and disposal assets. And we've always talked about the recycling investments being one of the best return on invested capital that we have across our portfolio. And we are seeing that not just hold, but accelerate. So we're really happy to see payback periods in that six to seven year range. And we've got confidence that with some of the outsized performance, particularly on throughput and volume, as Tara outlined, it's actually going to be better than what we had planned when we built the strategy despite the lower commodity price values. So as Jim mentioned earlier, all of our diligence and integration planning processes has really spoken to our bullishness with regard to the long-term strategic outlook of this business. With regard to pricing, what I would tell you, Jerry, is this integration planning hasn't been customer oriented. It's been more about bringing the two teams together, bringing our systems and processes together and thinking about how we can use the WM way of using technology to optimize our fleet using technology to optimize the back office in order to reduce the cost of serving in that business. We'll know more once the Stericycle team is part of WM about the runway and projections on revenue growth. But we still think that the overall investment thesis holds because we think that long-term medical waste is one of those parts of the U.S. economy where we're going to see an outsized growth. And then, Noah, from a rollover perspective, we see about $150 million of rollover benefit to the revenue line, which we think will translate to about $35 million of EBITDA in 2025. So the volume story for 2024 has been one for us where the commercial collection business and MSW, which really speak to us about the general health of the overall economy has been really strong over the course of the year and consistent with expectations. The one soft spot for us has been those industrial hauls and they've been lighter than we expected and certainly, something that we hear in the marketplace about just a little more reservation on industrial investment in this environment. We think some of that could loosen up in the fourth quarter after there is clarity in the election, but yet to be determined and certainly not something that we're creating guidance outlook on. With respect to the revenue guide for the fourth quarter, it really isn't a volume story where we were reserved on top line relative to Q3, it was commodity price. And so I would tell you, the expectation is take those Q3 volumes that we saw and carry them into Q4 and early 2025 is what our outlook includes. So I would say it's typical competition reviews in the Canada market, specifically, nothing that concerns us with regard to the pathway to getting to close and I just have to say thank you to all of our team members who have been working really diligently both the legal team and the Canada operations leadership in order to work through these processes. And we're optimistic that we're going to be able to get that clearance here yet in the fourth quarter and move quickly to close. And year-to-date, our maintenance and repairs costs in this environment are flat effectively on a dollar basis. So it's a good indication of getting leverage off of the truck deliveries, and we expect that momentum to continue into the year ahead. And then I would say the 2024 increase specifically relates to our intentional acceleration in some of the spending into Q4 as we complete these projects and accelerate the ongoing capital investment at the remaining portfolio. So that is really timing related. It's not an indication of the inflation that Tara spoke to. And from a macro perspective, I do think some of the interest rate environment will be an interesting watch point for us with things like housing starts lagging recently. And if you could start to see some momentum there, although news out this morning isn't all that favorable. So it's one of the things that we have our eye on because this really is about the temporary side of the industrial part of the business rather than the permanent side. Yes, it's a great question, and thank you for excluding Stericycle because it's too early for us to say. But so what I would tell you is over the long term, we've targeted 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion in the collection and disposal business. And when we look ahead, all the conversation about the strong execution on efficiency and retention that have driven the best operating expense as a percentage of revenue really that we've seen in our company's history, we expect that to continue, and we expect that to be a driver of continued growth in the year ahead. So one caveat that I have to that, and it is an important one because it's larger for us than it is for our competitors, is there is the expiration of the alternative fuel tax credit in 2025. That's about $60 million of EBITDA and a 30 basis point headwind to margin in the year ahead. So the 50 to 100, I would tell you, bring down by that 30 basis points for the range. But we're targeting that same execution for 2025. And then when we look at the sustainability businesses, that's incremental upside for us. And we see the sustainability businesses -- the renewable energy business provided 30 basis points of margin expansion for us in the third quarter of 2024. And we think when we look ahead, to a full year contribution from the five facilities that Jim and Tara have talked about bringing online by the end of 2024, we see another 30 basis points of expansion from this level. So I think it's really a great point, and it's one that we're not taking for granted. And I think it's their ERP journey is one that has gotten a lot of attention, rightfully so, both internally and externally and bringing all of their disparate businesses onto a single platform has been a significant undertaking, and we're commending them for all of that hard work and that effort. What I would tell you is that when you have that kind of an undertaking for call it, a $2.5 billion to $3 billion revenue business and you compare that to a similar undertaking for a $20 billion-plus business, that's one of the things that will be structurally different between the two. And we anticipated that when we evaluated the acquisition opportunity. That really is the one that we think stands out. The rest of it, we think there's tremendous opportunity and upside to use the WM Way, so to speak, in order to optimize SG&A as a percentage of revenue long term. I think it's really important to make a statement about the cash flow generation power of this business. While we're going to see a step change in our leverage with the closing of the Stericycle acquisition, we expect to return to target leverage ratios within 18 to 24 months of closing the transaction. And really, when you step back and look at the fact that before adding Stericycle to WM and before the step change that we're talking about coming in 2027 in free cash flow associated with the sustainability businesses, we're generating over $3 billion annually in free cash flow. And so that indicates our ability to use, call it, $6 billion over a 2-year period in order to meet the dividend and then have substantial free cash flow for the benefit of growth, for the benefit of balance sheet rationalization, it just speaks to the strong fundamentals of this business and our ability to have strategic runway in the sustainability business if we continue to see the return profile of those opportunities present themselves at the highest and best use of our funds. Yes. So we're not thinking about there being risk associated with the change in administration. But that certainly is something that could be on the table, but it's very difficult for us to be able to project. But with regard to what we've been accruing, there's $145 million in 2024, and that's showing up both as a reduction in cash taxes and a reduction in our provision on the income statement. We see the downside risk associated with really two things. One is solely timing. And if we saw one of our projects slip into 2025 in the first quarter. We wouldn't get that [technical difficulty] the complexity of the IRA and specifically, the applicability of the domestic content rules. We've evaluated those, and we think that the team is doing all of the right work, but the devils in the details when it comes to tax legislation. And so while we think we've done the right thing, it will come down to interpretation. We've taken that that into account as well in providing our guidance, but won't be finalized within a year. That will be something that continues as we have the IRS review our findings. So rather than give you specific margins on the business, what I think is important is that we bring it all together and say from a return on invested capital perspective and a margin expansion perspective, we've effectively seen a 10 percentage point increase in the margin of the business post automation, and that's a really strong indication of the power of the technology. And whether that be top line growth or middle of the P&L management cost reduction, we're seeing the benefits on each part of the model, and that's about a 10 percentage point lift in margin."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Before we dive in our operational performance and financial metrics, I want to take a minute to acknowledge and thank our team for providing safe and reliable service to our customers, especially considering the severe weather events. Hurricanes Helene and Milton effect of both our employees and the communities we serve. We are working hard to support those impacted helping restore a sense of normalcy in these areas. Turning to our results. We continue to prioritize technology and automation to optimize our cost structure and enhance operational efficiency. This is evident in operating expenses of 60.6% of revenue in the third quarter, which improved 70 basis points and overcame a 30 basis point headwind from additional workdays in the quarter. This is the fourth consecutive quarter this measure has been below 61%. This quarter's result is driven by continued benefits from cost optimization, pricing discipline and easing inflation. We also benefited from lower fuel prices and stronger contributions from our renewable energy business, though these gains were offset by the impact of increased recycled commodity prices on the brokerage business. Our operating expense performance was largely driven by our collection business, in particular, in labor and repair and maintenance costs. Labor costs improved through a combination of retention, technology and automation. We've automated more than 800 routes in our residential fleet since 2022, reducing our labor dependence, boosting efficiency and improving safety performance. The continued adoption of scheduling and planning tools, advanced mapping systems and dynamic routing is also driving efficiency and reducing operating costs. In the third quarter, our weighted average collection efficiency rose by 2%, with the residential line of business increasing more than 4%. Our intentional focus on making WM a great place to build a career is leading to reduced driver and technician turnover, improving about 19% annualized, a significant improvement over last year. Repair and maintenance costs also improved as a percentage of revenue, driven by our ongoing implementation of technology-driven processes and improvements in our truck delivery schedule. Our focus and execution in these areas are leading to strong financial performance as adjusted operating EBITDA in the collection and disposal business grew $181 million in the quarter, with margin expanding to 37.4%. Finally, turning to our revenue growth. Our pricing results continue to track well. Our team continues to leverage customer-specific data and insights to deliver pricing in line with inflation alongside our margin expansion objectives. We are being purposeful in allocating our people and our assets to their best use. This approach is very evident in our residential line of business, where we've intentionally moved away from lower-margin business, while at the same time, significantly improving our safety performance, growing organic revenue and expanding operating EBITDA margin. By maintaining and growing the right volumes, we are driving long-term value and enhancing overall returns. Our volume results have trended consistently to what we saw in the first half of the year with growth from commercial collection, MSW and special waste. It is encouraging to see our key volumes continue to grow, particularly MSW, which was up 5.7% in the quarter. While the roll-off business remained soft, the declines in volume showed sequential improvement. Similar to the residential business, we're making the right volume trade-offs as organic revenue grew in the quarter and operating EBITDA margin expanded. Churn was 9.2% in the quarter, which is similar to last year and validates the effectiveness of our customer lifetime value model. Service increases continue to outpace decreases, further reinforcing our execution. We remain confident that our data-driven business decisions and technology investments are leading to greater operational efficiency and improved return on capital, which is reflected in the growth and margin performance of our collection and disposal operations. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team again for their contributions. Their performance positions us for a strong year-end finish and sustained growth heading into 2025. And now I'll turn the call over to Devina to discuss our third quarter financial results in further detail. Yes. Toni, I think certainly, we're pleased. As I said in my prepared remarks, we remain on track with regard to our pricing objectives for the year. A few things I would point out is when you look at the spread to our you see that CPI is down, again, about 120 basis points for the quarter and 160 basis points year-to-date. And if you compare that to our core price and yield numbers, I think it tells a good story. And then to the comments you heard from Jim and Devina and I had shown up certainly in the margin. So long story short, we feel good about the kind of disciplined approach we're taking to pricing. The customer value lifetime model we're using from a data and analytics standpoint and when you look at -- as I mentioned, when you look at the spread, it continues to show up in OpEx and in margin. Toni, the one final point I might make is while inflation is generally coming down, we're not seeing that with our frontline wages and that's part of the reason why you hear so much conviction about the continued investments in automation and technology, whether it's core business, whether it's recycling facilities, we're still seeing 4.5% to 5.5% on general wage inflation with those frontline roles. In fact, we heard from one of our AVPs during the quarterly reviews that we're hiring technicians, and that number starts with a four now and it's going to start with a five in terms of the rate per hour. So when you look at the investments we're making to try to be a little less labor dependent through attrition, as Jim mentioned, it kind of gives us that much more conviction about those investments. Yes, Jerry, Devina touched on it, but I do think when you step back a little bit from it, it's there's elements of that business that fit very nicely over top of WM and if you kind of consider it a fourth line of collection business, right, in terms of trucks and maintenance and repair and labor and efficiency and all the things that we've talked to you folks about over the last couple of years, we think there's benefits down the road or we can overlay those investments and processes to drive some -- drive improvement on the operating side. Thank you. Yes, certainly. Yes. So we've had a strong year. We closed almost $800 million of acquisitions. I think on the last call we mentioned that we probably could be in the range of $1 billion. And we still feel good about the pipeline, whether that closes in Q4, it rolls a little bit into Q1 is yet to be determined, but we feel good about the pipeline and the deals that we have teed up I think important to note, we said this on the last call, there's a handful of markets we mentioned Arizona, the Carolinas, Florida and now the most recent acquisition of Winters Brothers in Long Island. Those are both represent not only good deals for us, but in strategic markets for a host of different reasons. So we feel really good about that. They're all performing very well to date and we're focused on trying to get the next handful of deals closed here in the next few months. Yes, Kevin, I think that's fair. And you're starting to see, I think this quarter was a 40 basis point improvement in terms of maintenance and repairs. There's two sides to that. There's the fleet side and the non-fleet side. On the fleet side, we continue to -- a couple of things are benefiting us. One is truck deliveries have been more consistent now than they've really been since sort of pre-COVID. So it's allowing us to plan more strategically for assets coming into the system and going out of the system. I will add, when we talk about -- and this is a big part of our strategy, we talk about residential automation. The configuration of that vehicle replacing a rear loader can -- that truck day one is going to be more expensive to run than a traditional rear loader. But what's important to take away from that is we look at it both from an M&R perspective, but we also look at it from a total cost of operation on a per unit basis. So when you double plus the efficiency, we may be willing to pay more to maintain a more complicated vehicle with different technology in it if it's driving overall CPU performance, which you are seeing and you're clearly seeing it in the margins. In residential, I think I'm going off the top of my head here, but we were up about 300-plus basis points for the quarter on 2.9% less volume. And so when you wrap all that together, you're right, there are still opportunities in maintenance and repairs, but we do backstop that against sort of our overall total cost of operation goals. Trevor, I would tell you, we saw a pretty consistent landfill performance through most of the organization. We pointed out there was three or four areas sort of in the middle of the country, if you will, that were the ones that drove the outside performance. One in particular is now a rail served operation that we got opened last year, and we're starting to see continued volume growth there, and that was a chunk of it. That really speaks to sort of the network planning aspect of what we do with our post-collection sites, and you folks have heard us talk about that a good bit. So one of the slugs, if you will, volume that helped us in the last couple of quarters is us opening up another intermodal facility in the Midwest. I think Jim commented too, our special waste volumes were strong and a good part of that volume was flowing through a handful of those same regions in the middle of the country. Yes, David. There's nothing right now that we've quantified for the balance of year or obviously 2025. These storms were obviously historic in a lot of ways, but first and foremost, our people are safe. Our assets were largely untouched first and foremost. In terms of the cleanup, we continue to talk the teams across the Southeast and specifically Florida. There may be some benefit down the road here, but I don't think it's going to be similar to anything we saw with Hurricane Ian, for example. But there's nothing in our outlook right now regarding any volume we would potentially get from those events. Yes. I mean the team has done a great job. We've got a really healthy inventory of contracts that are not performing up to par. And I think we'll continue to see -- it moderated a bit, if you look at year-to-date quarter-over-quarter a bit. But when you look, Jim, at the benefits from efficiency, safety and overall margin improvement, we're going to stay on this path until that line of business competes with the other collection lines, which has been kind of our mission since day 1. Yes, it's a good point. I think, as I mentioned earlier, the fact that we frankly have a stability in our fleet delivery schedule we haven't had in a number of years is really paying dividends, not just on total M&R as percentage or CPU, but also in our ability to really manage our asset base better and make sure that we're optimizing the number of assets we have in this case vehicles. I mentioned the one area of pressure, we still see specific to M&R and really across labor is still wage pressure. That's probably in the 4.5% to 5.5%, maybe 6% in some markets. So we continue to obviously make the necessary adjustments there. And I think the punch line is our retention for drivers and technicians is around 19%. It's a little lower for drivers, little higher for technicians. But even in that environment, we're still bringing the defection of our employees down, which is obviously having a big benefit. And then lastly, with respect to the -- some of the operations we've purchased, I mentioned a few that we've done this year. While they've been really, really well-run companies, I think one of the places we get leverage out of is what you've heard Jim and Devina I referenced, which is sort of our WM Way playbook. And we see that as a way to capture additional value when we go into even a well-run operation. But we put the strength of our supply chain, our operating team and all the tools and technology they come with. That's one of the areas we continue to see upside. I think we've got about 11 more 100 routes that are eligible to be automated. And I would tell you, it's at least two years and probably into the third year before we cycle through all of them. But as I mentioned, I mean, from an efficiency margin safety standpoint, go down the list, we're even though we're trading off a little bit of volume, it's obviously from an investment perspective, been a fantastic effort by the team."

            "name": "Tara Hemmer",
            "content": "So I can take this one. This is Tara Hemmer. You'll recall during our last call, $800 million is what we plan to deliver in 2027, and we had pushed that out. If you look at the earnings contribution for 2024 from the sustainability-related businesses, we're expecting that to be in the $120 million to $130 million range for 2024. And you'll recall, we had originally guided $115 million plus another $15 million coming from commodity prices in the recycling business. Related to what we expect to deliver in 2025, what we can tell you really qualitatively is a little bit of the pieces. We certainly expect higher EBITDA growth as these plants come online, not just on the RNG space, but also the recycling space. And we're going to expect lower CapEx in 2025. So when you put those pieces together, you'll expect greater flow-through. The other thing we should mention is we are expecting slightly higher CapEx for the program. Originally, we had said between $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, and we're now expecting about $3 billion. So all in all, we do expect 2025 to be a significant year for our sustainability-related investments. It's a bit premature for us to give you all the pieces for 2025 based on where things may shake out related to the completion of the plants in Q4 of 2024. And then also, of course, we're tracking closely commodity prices. So we'll give more of an update in early 2025. And if you look at those details, what you'll see is year-to-date, we've delivered $92 million EBITDA. Absolutely. You have that right. You have the pieces right. Well, what we can tell you is we're tracking a couple of key metrics. The first and we've said this consistently, the labor cost per ton is really in that 30% improvement range and that is consistent across all of our plants. The other thing that we're seeing is roughly 17% higher blended value on the commodities we sell. We're creating a cleaner product, and this is really important. If you think about the commodity prices that we're at today and we're expecting to end the year around $90 a ton. Our investment thesis was $1.25. So getting a higher blended value on our commodities is very important, and that's been proven out. The other thing that we track is our gross operating expenses, and those are also 17% improvement across the portfolio of automation plants. And then the other point that we don't talk about as much is volume. And we are seeing a volume growth story coming out of these investments, which was a pivotal piece of what we were going to be really offering to the communities that we have these investments in. And Q3 was one of the first quarters where we've seen that volume growth because we've had some impacts related to shutdowns. So we'll see that transfer across each year. So when you stack those together, we're seeing strong margin improvement on our recycling plants across the portfolio. Exactly. So plants processing faster. We're also expanding the size of some of these plants as we're building them. And it's been a great story when we look at one of the markets John is going to be visiting later today in Minneapolis, where we've seen really, really strong volume growth in that market and then also EBITDA performance. Sure. I'm glad you brought that up because I think there's a tendency to look at the spot market prices for RINs. And just a reminder, we are taking a portfolio-based view of our RNG that we're producing. And one of the things that we outlined was to really work on contracting more of our volume. So today, we are at about 40% for 2025, and we expect to expand that over the balance of Q4 going into early 2025. And that is a mix of long-term offtake in the voluntary market with utilities and also our ability to forward sell 2025 RINs, and we've been able to do that successfully. So that gives us confidence in really any political environment, whether or not Trump or Harris gets elected, we're seeing strong forward selling on 2025 RINs. It's a mix, primarily on the renewable natural gas side related to cost inflation on the construction of the plants and then also some higher cost on utility interconnects and those utility interconnects are for our electrical interconnect and our natural gas interconnect. So it's really those two categories. Yes. So the original number, the breakdown was roughly $1.2 billion from renewable energy and $1 billion from recycling. And so today, the increased number to $3 billion the 75% is based on the $3 billion and the split is roughly $1.4 billion for recycling and 1.6 for renewable energy. Adding new facilities. That's a great point, Jim. And also, we changed the plants within the renewable energy portfolio, so the plan slightly different. And that's one of the reasons, if you go back to the Investor Day deck, we were projecting $740 million in EBITDA, and that got moved to $800 million. So it's one of the reasons why that was more contact setting if you go back to the Investor Day, but the numbers that we've outlined and the mix of plants on both sides are different. So it represents about 55% to 60% of our overall blended value. And what has changed over time with our automated investment is we're able to capture a bit more OCC through some of the quality improvements that we've made in our plans and move really more of our mixed paper to a higher-value product. So that's been a real bright spot for us when you think about our automation investments. Yes. Yes. So we've actively looked at and we have a beat on how much landfill gas that we have that we could really convert into R&D through new investments. And it's important to note the first 20 that we built, they tend to be larger plants where we had more landfill gas. So we're taking a much more prescriptive approach on the next tranche and really evaluating whether or not we should be developing them ourselves or perhaps leveraging a partner for those. That's something we'll likely make a decision on in 2025. And just as a reminder, that last part that Devina mentioned, it's the difference between 30% and 40%. And so we're confident we would get the 30%. It's really just the difference between 30% and 40% on ITC. Our underlying assumptions for our blended commodity basket in Q4 is $85 a ton. Good morning. Well, the way to think about it, and we've said this previously, is about 60% of the benefit related to our automation plans is really independent of commodity prices, and that's the labor cost. That's the uplift that we get on blended values because we're producing a higher-quality product. And we're definitely seeing those flow through when we bring these automated plants online. So there's less of a sensitivity to commodity prices, but there still is a sensitivity that exists in the business."

Any redistribution, retransmission, or rebroadcast of this call in any form without the express written consent of WM is prohibited. Now I'll turn the call over to WM's President and CEO, Jim Fish.\nJim Fish: Okay, thanks, Ed, and thanks for joining us. Our results for the quarter were fueled by strong operating performance in the collection and disposal business. We once again achieved double-digit operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter, keeping us on pace to achieve the full-year outlook that we provided last quarter. Quarterly operating EBITDA margin reached 30% for the first time in the company's history, driven by operating efficiencies from technology investments and the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy. We're pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of strong financial results. Our team's executing very well on our strategic priorities, as evidenced by the expected growth in operating EBITDA, approaching 10% for the full year. A big part of our strategic approach to growth is to find future opportunities where we can leverage our own expertise, whether it's using technology to improve our routing efficiencies, turning landfill gas into renewable natural gas, or automating recycling plants to drive greater throughput and lower operating costs. Each of these recognizes a future need and capitalizes on it. And now our recently announced agreement to acquire Stericycle presents another opportunity to leverage our expertise to drive higher growth. Stericycle has a leading position in the growing medical waste industry. The planned acquisition adds complementary business platforms to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions. And these strategic benefits are accompanied by attractive financial benefits. Our team is progressing through the regulatory approval process and integration planning, and we're excited to welcome Stericycle's team members to WM. Even as we add medical waste as a new vertical within our business to complement our existing collection and disposal business, we continue to position our solid waste network for future growth. As we've said, the pipeline for solid waste tuck-in acquisition opportunities was strong coming into 2024. Our teams worked hard to move tuck-in acquisitions to completion, and we've now closed more than $750 million of solid waste acquisitions through July. These transactions strengthen our core collection and disposal operations in North America in new geographies like Long Island, New York, and complement existing operations through tuck-in acquisitions in growth markets in Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona. We also continue to execute well on sustainability, our sustainability growth investments. We expect to bring five new renewable natural gas projects online in 2024, adding to the two new facilities completed in 2022 and 2023. We have another nine projects in active construction, with construction beginning or expected to begin on the remaining four facilities later this year. Momentum is building, and we're excited about the progress we're making. Investing directly in building our renewable natural gas platform meets all of our investment criteria. We're driving strong returns with expected payback periods of three years or four years at better multiples than traditional M&A. Plus, we're expanding environmental benefits by collecting and beneficially using more landfill gas, and we're strengthening our core business by positioning our landfill assets as community energy partners. Looking forward, we're exploring the scale of opportunity in future project development, and growth from our renewable energy business across our landfill network. At the same time, we continue to maximize the value of the renewable energy we produce through a balanced marketing strategy that leverages the transportation and voluntary markets to secure returns, reduce risk, and manage volatility. These efforts demonstrate our commitment to scaling this unique growth opportunity to create long-term value for the environment and shareholders alike. Turning to recycling our investments and automating our existing facilities and building capacity in new markets is helping differentiate WM with customers, unlocking new opportunities to further expand our network, such as recent success [indiscernible]. At the same time, our automation investments are providing consistent financial results, improving labor costs per ton by 30% to 35%, and increasing the blended value on commodity sales by 15% to 20%. We completed our Pittsburgh and Atlanta automation projects during the second quarter, and both facilities ramped up quickly. We're on track to complete another seven automation projects and add new facilities in New York, Florida, and Portland by year end. Our progress to date increases our capacity from our recycling investments by more than a 1 million tons. The WM story is one of delivering on our commitments. We achieved strong results in the first half of 2024, and are positioned to continue that trajectory during the balance of the year. As we kick off our planning process for next year, we have some early enthusiasm about 2025. Based on all the opportunities we discussed today, we're particularly bullish on the long term. It's our dedicated team that makes all of this possible, and I want to thank them for all of their contributions. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results.\nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim. And good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter results, particularly our ongoing optimization of operating costs. Our teams remain intently focused on delivering safe and reliable service to our customers, and I want to thank them for their dedication, especially those in areas impacted by Hurricane Beryl in early July. Second quarter operating expenses is a percentage of revenue improved by 130 basis points year-over-year to 60.9%. This improvement is a testament to our disciplined management of operating costs and our collection lines of business. Combining our strong operating expense performance with disciplined pricing, we significantly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins. In the second quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew by $203 million, with margin expanding to 37.3%. Our continued adoption of technology and automation was a key driver of these significant operating cost improvements. Specifically, in labor, the use of scheduling and planning tools, advanced mapping technology, expansion of our dynamic routing capabilities, and automation of our residential fleet resulted in improved efficiency across all three of our collection lines of business for the second consecutive quarter. In residential, efficiency improved by nearly 6% in Q2, largely due to fleet automation. Our automated routes achieved over 30% efficiency improvement, contributing to a significant increase in residential operating EBITDA margin when compared to last year. Additionally, our people-first focus led to reduced driver turnover, which improved 300 basis points from a year ago. Company-wide, the integration of technology and improved driver retention contributed to a 90 basis point reduction in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. We remain confident in the value of our technology and optimization efforts, and we expect to continue driving labor cost improvements throughout the year. Turning other operating costs, repair and maintenance spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 20 basis points, reflecting our continued adoption of technology-enabled processes and an improving truck delivery schedule. Lower fuel costs also contributed 20 basis point improvement to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. We remain committed to optimizing our cost structure to meet both operational and financial objectives, and we're proud of the results we have achieved so far. And finally, turning to revenue growth, our customer lifetime value model continued to drive organic revenue growth from price in line with our full year expectations. Our pricing results relative to plan remain on track, reflecting our team's focus on using customer-specific data and insights to deliver price increases that keep pace with inflation and margin expansion objectives. Churn remains at 9%, and service increases continue to outpace decreases, further reinforcing our execution. On the volume front, trends in commercial collection, MSW, and special waste remain strong in the quarter and are generally aligned with expectations. As are C&D landfill volumes when adjusted for the lapping of volumes related to Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. However, volume in our roll-off line of business is one area where we continue to see a bit of softness. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see moderation in both a temporary business driven by home building, as well as a portion of our permanent roll-off business in the industrial segment. While a few segments of our collection volume are trending a bit behind our full year expectations, our discipline revenue management combined with our strong execution on cost optimization continue to give us ample confidence that we are positioned to deliver strong financial performance throughout the rest of the year. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team again for their contributions. Their performance so far in 2024 sets us up for continued success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our second quarter financial results in further detail.\nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. We're pleased with the strong start to 2024, particularly when we focus on the three most important financial measures we track, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, and free cash flow. Starting with operating EBITDA, through the first six months, we have seen this metric grow more than 12%, with all of this growth being organic. This puts us on track to deliver our full year outlook of nearly 10% operating EBITDA growth, well above our long-range annual target of 5% to 7%. As a reminder, in setting our operating EBITDA target for 2024 and then quickly increasing it by $100 million in April, we projected that achieving this year's outsized growth would be driven by two things. The first is the benefits of price and cost optimization in the collection and disposal business, which we expected to be weighted toward the first half of the year. And the second is incremental earnings contributions from our investments in growing our recycling and renewable energy businesses, which would be weighted toward the back half of the year. This is exactly how 2024 is tracking, giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for operating EBITDA, with our current projection being $6.475 billion. This includes about $20 million to $30 million of incremental growth from tech-in solid waste acquisitions in 2024. Turning now to operating EBITDA margin, it's worth highlighting again that at 30%, Q2 is the best quarterly operating EBITDA margin result in our company's history. In the second quarter, total company operating EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points, and this was driven by about 200 basis points of margin expansion from price and cost optimization efforts in the collection and disposal business, and then a benefit from the sale of non-strategic assets of about 50 basis points. These strong margin results were partially offset by higher risk management costs, an increase in incentive compensation costs, and a modest drag from the net impact of recycled commodity prices and fuel. The key takeaway from looking at these puts and takes is that we saw a 200 basis point lift in our core business versus last year, and we see the benefits of employee retention, truck deliveries, and the use of technology and process to optimize the business that started in the second half of 2023 holding. The significant margin expansion in operating EBITDA growth in 2024 is delivering robust operating and free cash flow growth. Through the first six months of 2024, we've generated cash flow from operations of $2.52 billion, and that's an increase of nearly $450 million or 22% compared to the same period in 2023. Our double-digit operating EBITDA growth, favorable working capital trends, and lower cash incentive compensation payments are driving this strong performance. For the first half of the year, capital expenditures to support the business totaled $947 million. Sustainability growth investments were about $388 million. Both are tracking a plan that we anticipate spending at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance of between $850 million and $900 million for sustainability growth investments in 2024. Pulling this all together, we've generated $1.24 billion of free cash flow in the first six months of the year, and we're confident that we will achieve our guidance range of between $2 billion and $2.15 billion of free cash flow in 2024. As Jim mentioned, we've closed more than $750 million in Truck-In acquisitions through July, and we look forward to closing the acquisition of Stericycle as early as the fourth quarter of this year. Given our elevated M&A activity, we want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and emphasize our commitment to a strong balance sheet. WM has a disciplined approach to allocating capital to strategic growth opportunities, including the capital needed to sustain and grow our core solid waste businesses and investments that we're making to grow our recycling and renewable energy assets. We prioritize return on invested capital in making these decisions, and we expect all of our investments to provide healthy returns above our cost of capital. We also remain committed to growing shareholder returns, which includes increasing the dividend as free cash flow grows. We intend to finance the Stericycle transaction using a combination of bank debt and senior notes. When combining the impacts of the $750 million of solid waste Tuck-In acquisitions with the funding of Stericycle, we now expect our leverage to be about 3.6 times post-close. In light of this elevated leverage, we're temporarily suspending our share repurchase program so that we can work our way back through our targeted leverage range of 2.75 times to 3 times, about 24 months after the close of Stericycle. The slight revisions in our projected leverage figures since our announcement of the planned acquisition of Stericycle are updates that reflect the impact of layering on the additional Tuck-In acquisition activity this year. We're steadfast in our commitment to debt investors and rating agencies because we know the value of our strong investment grade credit profile. To wrap up, we're very pleased with our strong results, and I know the WM team remains hard at work to deliver on all of our goals for 2024. With that, Livia, let's open the line for questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. And our first question coming from the line of Tyler Brown from Raymond James.\nTyler Brown : Hey, good morning.\nDevina Rankin : Good morning.\nTyler Brown : Hey, Devina, so obviously, you know, solid quarter great start to the year. I think last call you mentioned north of 30% margins in Q2, possibly north of 31% in Q3. Looks like Q2 came in more around 30%. I just wanted to see if that north of 31% is still a good placeholder, or should we maybe think about moving that down a smidge?\nDevina Rankin : So, I'll start by highlighting that the one item that was different than our expectations at the end of April when we spoke about that little north of 30% for Q2 is the risk management impact of 50 basis points in the quarter. So, if we had not had that item, which we couldn't have predicted, we would have come in at or above the target that I provided on the call last time. What I would say about when we look forward to Q3, what's changed a little bit, there's a couple of things. One is recycled commodity prices, and you guys know that we have a different geography than our competitors do with regard to the impact of recycled commodity prices. And that was a 40 basis point headwind in the quarter, and we expect elevated commodity prices to continue into the back half of the year. So, there is a little bit of a headwind that we weren't projecting from recycling brokerage in particular that would carry over. And then, in addition to that, with lower industrial volumes that John mentioned, the flow through on industrial volumes is generally strong 40% levels. And so, that again is one of the things that created a headwind in the quarter and that would impact Q3. The third item relates to the Tuck-In acquisition contributions. As you know, based on where we are in integration processes, integrated M&A revenue and activity tends to come in in early innings at a lower contribution margin than our base business. So, what I would say is that right now our Q3 outlook is in the range of 30.5% to 31% with all those things taken into account.\nTyler Brown : Yes, quite a few things. Okay, perfect. And then, as we think about EBITDA dollars, so I just want to make sure I understand some of the moving pieces to the guidance. So, because I believe at the end of Q1 you had only spent like maybe $10 million on acquisitions. You mentioned $750 million through July. I would have thought that that would have, you know, obviously including Winters Bros, so I would have thought that would have helped maybe the guidance. I assume there's some EBITDA associated with that. So, I guess one, can you talk about what the end year revenue contribution from M&A should be in '24? And then, can you just talk about, maybe some of the puts and takes? Because, again, I would have thought there would have been some EBITDA contributions there. Maybe there's something. You mentioned a few things breaking against you.\nJohn Morris : Yeah, Tyler, it's John. Good question. I mean, if you look at what we did in Q2, it was about $77 million of revenue that was acquired. The $750 that we put, that we've all talked about, represents about $300 million of acquired revenue by the end of the year. So, hopefully that clarifies a little bit. And then, what Devina and I talked about is there is some benefit we've talked about in the back half of the year, that $25-ish million that will be a contribution from some of the M&A we've referenced.\nDevina Rankin: So, in terms of overall EBITDA growth for the year, what I would say is, when we look at the first half of the year, right, the first half of the year, Solid Waste EBITDA has grown $415 million. Quite remarkable. The headwind that I talked about in risk management, it shows up in the corporate and other category. And so, what you see is, you know, there was more of an offset to that Solid Waste growth in the first -- in the second quarter than what we experienced in the first quarter. But the sustainability businesses, we still expect to be on track to generate that $115 million of EBITDA contribution to the year. And when we think about what happened over the second quarter that may not be showing up as a direct increase in that amount, it really is a put-and-take story. One is the value, the incremental value we expect from higher commodity prices in the recycling business, partially offset by the impact of a slowdown in some of the construction projects on the renewable energy business. Now, we're talking weeks, not months here, right? This is contributions that we now expect to start to ramp more in the fourth quarter than what we were expecting earlier in the second half of the year. So, all-in-all, what I would tell you is the EBITDA growth story for us is approaching 10% in the year, and still most of that coming from the solid waste business, with the contributions coming from the sustainability business, in total tracking according to plan, though there was a put-and-take.\nJim Fish: So, Tyler, Jim here, let me just give you a little bit of extra color here. The 25 that Devina referenced in kind of our forecast over the revised guidance number of 6,450 that we gave last quarter, that 25 has some of what John talked about, which is the Winter Bros acquisition. We'll get five months-ish of that. We already had baked into our original guidance some M&A EBITDA and revenue, but can't say we baked in Winter Bros. So, you're going to get part of that. You're going to get, as Devina said, you're going to get some of the sustainability stuff, which, by the way, is working both ways for us. I mean, we get some commodity pickup. We also are seeing a few minor delays in a couple of the R&G plants. We're still building five R&G plants for the year, as we said we would, but 30 days or so of delay is impacting us. So, all of that adds up to the 25. I think Devina's point, though, is really worth really reiterating here. I mean, you're talking about almost 10% EBITDA growth, and to some degree, I feel like we have a great story to tell, and sometimes we aren't great storytellers, because I feel like we've got 10%, which is the strongest EBITDA growth, probably back to the 1990s. I'm sure the company grew by more than 10% in 1982, but since the 1990s, that's the strongest EBITDA growth we've ever seen, and yet we're doing it. You remember in 2019, when we said we grew EBITDA between 5% and 7%, we said, at the top end of the range, that's going to be in a really robust economy, where we're seeing, you know, 2-plus percent volume growth. We're not seeing 2-plus percent volume growth. We're flat on volume, and yet, in an economy that's kind of stumbling along, honestly, and yet we're growing EBITDA by 10%. Almost all of that, except for that $25 million-ish or whatever that number is for us, almost all that's coming from organic growth. Same with last year. We grew by 7% last year, and it was almost all organic growth. It's coming from those things that we've talked about in the past. You know, you remember a couple years ago, we started talking about technology, probably five years ago. We're going to talk, we're going to bring technology to bear, and we're going to really make a commitment to sustainability, and we're going to put operating processes in place, improve efficiencies, we're going to get smarter with pricing through data analytics, all that stuff, and I remember on the earnings call getting questions like, okay, that's great, Jim. When are we going to see the impact on the bottom line? You are seeing the impact on the bottom line. When you see 10% EBITDA growth, 160 basis points of margin growth, and still 5-ish percent revenue growth, it's all coming from price, you are absolutely seeing that kind of strategic growth, and then at the same time, we're doing some acquisitions. I mentioned in my script where we're filling holes, either where we weren't before, or adding to really strong strategic positions like Texas, like Florida, like North Carolina, Tennessee, you could go down the list, Arizona, and then you've all seen a deck on Stericycle. I mean, Stericycle is basically a fourth line of business for us. We've got resi, we've got commercial, we've got industrial, now we've got medical. And with Stericycle comes significant opportunities for synergy and comes with a higher growth trajectory in medical waste than in the solid waste space. So we're very excited about that, which basically gets me to a 25 number, and 2025 we'll give you guidance in February. But I could not be more bullish when I think about 2025, when you add all those things up. I mean, think about these sustainability investments. Tara will tell you we've spent probably three-quarters of the capital, or we will have by the end of the year, and we will have only realized 15% of the EBITDA. So 2025, I don't care who gets elected in November. Well, I do, but it doesn't matter who gets elected in November. And it doesn't matter whether we have geopolitical problems. It doesn't matter whether the economy is up or down. We're going to have a blockbuster year in 2025. We'll talk about it in February. But that's on top of what we consider to be a blockbuster year this year. So a bit longer answer than I think you were bargaining for when you got on when you were first in the queue. But I just want to make sure everybody understands all that.\nTyler Brown : [Indiscernible]. It's great. I really appreciate it. I don't mean to split hairs too much, but we're kind of in that business. But I appreciate the call. Thank you.\nJim Fish: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nHilary Leon: Hi, this is Hilary Leon for Toni Kaplan. Good morning, guys. Great quarter. So speaking of the election, sorry to bring it up, but we've had a couple number of inquiries surrounding potential implications of it. Depending on who's elected or who's in the House, how would you expect R&G and RINs to be affected or if at all? And what sort of increase, decrease do you see potentially in your R&G projects?\nTara Hemmer: Sure, I'll answer that one. We've been obviously tracking this very closely. And I think what's important to note related to our R&G business is we're in a very different time than we were in the previous Trump administration. You've really seen a lot more development on plants. We've seen the voluntary market really shore up. And we also have the RVO that is in place through 2025. So if you look at analysts that really cover the R&G industry, by any measure, most are saying that they don't expect a significant decrease in RIN pricing really more solidly in that 250 range in a potential Trump presidency. And as you know, that is well above our investment thesis of $26 per MMBTU.\nJim Fish : So, Toni, real quickly, you know, Tara did a great job of answering that and she's absolutely right. I would just tell you, we've always said, no matter who's in office, we're pretty agnostic about that. I mean, we all have our own personal preferences, but the business itself does really well in just about any regulatory environment, short of somebody coming in and saying, you know, landfills are closed all tomorrow morning. But short of that, we are pretty agnostic with respect to regulation, whether it's the Chevron doctrine, whatever it is, we do well in just about any environment.\nHilary Leon: Got it. Great. Appreciate the color. And just a minor question. So, you know, with Hurricane Beryl happening recently, do you expect any sort of volume impact or top line growth impact, or is that not really significant?\nDevina Rankin: It's insignificant. We had our quarterly business reviews with the Texas market, who was hit the hardest, and they've made projections. But at this point, it's not expected to be material.\nJim Fish : It wasn't insignificant to my heart [ph]\nDevina Rankin: Yeah. We all felt more significant within the business world.\nJim Fish : It was more significant at my house, but as far as the business, it's not going to be material.\nHilary Leon: Got it. All right. That's it for me. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.\nDevina Rankin: Yeah.\nJim Fish : Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJerry Revich: Yes, hi. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nJim Fish : Good morning, Jerry.\nDevina Rankin: Good morning, Jerry.\nJerry Revich: Jim, on Stericycle, you know, I'm wondering if you just weigh in because historically, the company has really struggled to push pricing. And I think that's been because of the autoclave business. And you folks in your businesses are obviously leaders in driving pricing and return. So I'm wondering if you could just maybe peel back the onion on your strategy for that business and how you folks can have an impact on pricing discipline in the market through your ownership.\nJim Fish: Yeah, Jerry, it's a little hard to tell at this point. One thing I can tell you is that Stericycle has talked a lot about the fact that as they roll out new systems that those systems will give them better visibility. And boy, we absolutely concur with that. I mean, you know, we like the fact that our systems give us a lot of visibility all the way down at the customer level. So we don't really know what that means in terms of pricing at this point because we haven't had a chance to kind of stick our head under the covers. But we do know that the better the visibility, the smarter you can be with data and analytics and with pricing.\nJerry Revich: And in terms of the volume outlook, you know, I think historically the industry has had a much tougher volume result than what the forecast is going forward. Can you just talk about what's driving inflection in your view? And sorry, this is still on medical waste.\nJim Fish: Yeah, you know, I mean, I think this is really kind of an outsider looking in because, again, we're not, you know, we don't own the business yet. And we really, for the most part, are looking at public documents. We're starting to go through an integration process where we get to look at some things. But I would tell you that if we look at kind of the medical industry, not just medical waste but medical services, and as you look at the United States or you look at Canada or you look at just about any country, the U.K., France, Germany, I mean, all those countries are getting older. And so that would seem to be a positive for the volume of services in that industry. And commensurate with that, you would expect to see medical waste increase at a similar pace. So why their volumes have been a bit slower than expected, it's hard for me to say. But I sure do look at the future of this and say, this is a business that should have a very strong volume trajectory to it. I do think it will be helpful as we start to look at their customer base. They have a lot of customers that are moving towards kind of larger national account-type customers. And we're very good at national accounts. Our national accounts business has really been a driver of our growth over the last kind of five years to ten years. So as you look at their business that's going, in large part, from these small-quantity generators to more large-quantity generators, the UNHs and the HCAs and companies like that, I think that's right in our wheelhouse.\nJerry Revich: Super. And can I ask one more, Devina? In terms of the risk management costs in the quarter, can you just expand on those, you know, or how much of that is non-recurring out of period versus what might linger with us? It looks like based on the sequential outlook for margins and 3Q, it feels like you're applying normal seasonality to this lower base in 2Q that includes the headwind from the risk costs. So I'm wondering if you could just expand on that, if you don't mind.\nDevina Rankin: Sure. So in terms of what we experienced in the second quarter, you know, this is a business where we say safety is priority one and getting our team members home safe every day is the most important job that we all do. And I would tell you that, unfortunately, there were some incidents in the second quarter that resulted in reserves associated with some of the, you know, more significant incidences that we can, from time-to-time, incur in our business. It is not representative of long-term trends. It is not representative of something that we expect to repeat. So I would say non-recurring, not out of period. What I would say with regard to the seasonal trends, and I mentioned this when Tyler and I were talking about margins as well, is what's difficult about typical seasonal trends for us is that roll-off is really a big piece of what can drive seasonal trends upward. And we did not see the roll-off volume pickup that we would have expected to see, and we are cautious about that going into the third quarter. Aside from that, we do expect the traditional benefits that you get from higher MSW levels and the commercial collection line of business in particular continues to be really, really strong in terms of both volume growth, price execution, and really strong flow-through from those efficiency gains that we've had. So overall, seasonality expectations are very strong, and we expect that to continue with the exception of the muted roll-off impact.\nJerry Revich: I appreciate it. Thank you.\nDevina Rankin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question coming from the line of Noah Kaye from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nNoah Kaye : Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and not trying to turn this into a stair cycle deal call, of course, but I just want to ask you one or two quick questions there, and thanks for the deck. The $125 million or greater cost synergies you're, again, referencing, just help us understand what the expected timeline is for realizing those? You talked about run rates. Is this basically something that you get to a run rate on at some point in 2025? Is it earlier in the year? Is it later in the year? How are you thinking about it currently?\nJim Fish : Yeah, so it's a good question, Noah. You know, Rafa Carrasco, our officer here, is going to be running this for us, and Rafa is kind of right into the process of looking at what do the synergies look like for this deal. We said $125 at the start. We didn't really give kind of a breakdown of when we realized those. Some of those, obviously, you know you get up front, whether it is some internalization benefits on the disposal side. It's also, you know, some of the SG&A piece. But we do think that, as we said kind of early on, that the $125 is, you know, you can do some math to get to a point where you say that's pretty conservative, even if you're just looking at the SG&A line. We built in 300 basis points on the SG&A line, and their guidance for the year was 22% SG&A as a percent of revenue. And you know where ours is. I mean, we're at 9%. And by the way, as I think Davina said a couple of times, you probably should compare them not to the 9% but to what our areas run at. Our areas run at like 5%. So you can do some math and get to a much bigger number than 125, but that's what Rafa and his team are doing right now is determining, all right, what do the synergies look like? What comprises the $125? Is the $125 twice as big as that? I mean, what is that number? And then to your point, when do we get it? Is it, you know, we've kind of said three years to get there, but you may have most of it coming in year one. You may have most of it coming in year two. We don't quite know yet. That's where he's digging in. We will give quite a bit more color on this. First of all, once we own the business, we'll give a lot more color on it. And secondly, we'll give more color and we'll give guidance in February.\nDevina Rankin: So one data point, Noah, that I think is really helpful in terms of thinking about timing and why it would differ from, you know, the timeline that we saw on ADS as an example is that when you think about Stericycle and where they are in their journey, they are just completing their ERP implementation, and we think that there's reason to be cautious with respect to the pace at which we could capture synergies with this business. And Jim did a great job of articulating, you know, some of the work that's going on right now in order for us to be able to fortify our expectations and outlook. But I think that the ERP implementation journey that the Stericycle team has been on is one of the reasons that we're not at a position that we can speak to how quickly we can get there, although you know us well enough to know that we're going to move as fast as we can.\nNoah Kaye : Yeah, I think that those are both very fair points and well noted on the SG&A gap. That's something we look forward to hearing more about. A minor housekeeping question. It looked like in the investing line there was an outflow of roughly $800 million in other. What was that?\nDevina Rankin: Yeah, so it was about $775 million of unusual activity, and it will be disclosed specifically in the 10Q. But basically because of with the lead up to the announcement of the Stericycle acquisition, we were in a period where we had material non-public information, and we could not remarket our tax-exempt bonds to the marketplace. So we had to repurchase our own tax-exempt bonds for a short period of time. That's what that relates to. We've since already successfully remarketed the ones that have been in place or that could have gone back to the market through July, and then we have additional remarketing activity that will happen in the third quarters and fourth quarters where we expect to fully place those back into the marketplace by the end of the year.\nNoah Kaye : Okay. Thank you for that. And I guess just one high-level overarching question on the business. I think it speaks to, Jim, what you got into before around the outlook. Organically, you're still continuing to deliver growth. You're seeing this kind of price-cost spread continue. The market seems to be somewhat soft volume-wise around parts of the economy, industrial. How's the strength of the consumer, and what's your view into being able to continue to get a healthy level of price and an outside spread to your cost as we get into $25 million?\nJim Fish: Yeah, that's a great question. And I think the consumer has been pretty resilient through all of this, through COVID, through kind of the rebound, and through a bit of a -- look, it's not been a bad economy, but it just hasn't been a -- it certainly hasn't been a blockbuster economy. The consumer has been very resilient, and that's been the encouraging part. I think it shows up when you look at our kind of more small and medium businesses, which are reflected in our commercial. You know, the commercial line of business has been fairly strong for us on the volume side. Resi has been soft, but Resi is not really driven by consumer behavior. Resi has really been driven by John Morris, and John's been really working on improving margins in that line of business. The real softness has been in that temp roll-off, more industrial space. You know, if you look at our numbers, C&D has been soft, but a lot of that is just difficult comps because of the big Florida hurricane last year. Special waste has been pretty good. MSW has been quite good. So we're actually not that disappointed with flat volume, but it's just not the 2% to 3% that we kind of talked about, you know, in 2019 at the last investor day. I would tell you that the consumer seems to be resilient, seems to be fairly strong, so all of that's good for us.\nNoah Kaye : Thank you very much.\nJim Fish : One last quick point here when you talk about Stericycle. We really haven't talked that much about the operating side of this, but look, I think there's a real opportunity on the operating side. John's talked a lot about the efficiencies that we're bringing in the solid waste space, the technology that we're bringing to bear. All of that has application in the medical waste space, too, because they really run trucks the same way we run trucks.\nNoah Kaye : Yep. Yep, well taken. Thank you.\nJim Fish : Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Bryan Burgmeier from Citi. Your line is open.\nBryan Burgmeier : Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just a couple of housekeeping items. So maybe just following up on Jerry's question. It sounds like the risk management margin headwind is going to roll off at the end of 3Q, if that's correct. And then can you provide any clarity on the tax rate for 2024? The 1Q, I think, was in the high teens, and it kind of moved into the low 20s in 2Q. What do you think we shake out for the remainder of the year?\nDevina Rankin : Yeah, so what I would say is, I would describe the risk management item as a Q2 only item in terms of the magnitude of the 50 basis points headwinds because it was activity-based. It's not something that will be recurring in nature. With regard to tax rate, this is actually a little more complicated question to answer than you might anticipate. But what I would tell you is when we exited Q2, our projection for that is 22%. I'd clarify for you two important things. One is that it includes $145 million of investment tax credit benefits that we expect for the year. And if there is any change in the timing or place and service dates of our renewable natural gas facilities, you could see that change. But that's our best estimate as of right now. And then the second item is, there was a change in accounting in 2024 related to our low-income housing tax credit investment, and that actually has a slight impact on the effective tax rate because of a change in geography on the income statement. And Ed and Heather are happy to talk through that with you in more detail if you would like.\nBryan Burgmeier : Got it. Got it. Thanks for that detail. And just one more kind of housekeeping item is there's a comment in the press release on a small write-down from waste diversion technology. I know it's not exactly material, but just for our own knowledge, what are those investments? I think there was a similar write-down last year? How many of these type of maybe venture capital style investments does WM have out there at the moment? Thank you, and I'll turn it over.\nDevina Rankin : Sure. So I would tell you in terms of the portfolio, this was the largest investment of its kind that was remaining in our what you call venture capital type suite of investments. So there's not anything significant that I would tell you is looming here for similar investments. For this one in particular, it relates to the continuous investment that we had made, and you'll recall that this was all about looking for opportunities to divert MSW and see what we could do to create sustainable solutions for MSW. We continue to be focused on ensuring that we are thoughtful about what opportunities exist in the marketplace, and we were optimistic about this one, but the viability of it proved to be different than our initial expectations.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Kevin Chen from CIBC. Your line is open.\nKevin Chen : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just a few questions here on the Winter Bros acquisition. Just wondering strategically, if you could just walk me through. It looks like they have some waste-to-rail assets. Just wondering if that creates a platform for other opportunities for you. I think they were also a carter for an operator in New York City as part of these commercial zones. Does that do something? And then I know it's a multi-part question here, but I guess the third part would be it looks like they also have some shredding services. I'm just wondering how that plays into your proposed acquisition of Stericycle and its shredded assets. Thank you.\nJim Fish : Well, I'll start backwards, Kevin. I think with respect to New York City, we've been a long-term licensed Operator in New York City since the mid-'90s. So that's not the reason why Winter Bros was attracted to us. They're certainly the premier environmental service provider on Long Island. I think you hit on a couple of key things. One, it's a white space for us. It was sort of new real estate. It's not a secret that the Long Island market has got some disposal constraints that are growing at the end of this year with the planned closure of Brookhaven Landfill. They've got intermodal assets and capabilities that play very well into our network capabilities. And on top of that, the business runs really well standalone. So for us, we're really fortunate to have those folks join the WM team. They run about 150 routes out there. It's about 500 employees. So we're excited about that. In terms of the commercial waste zone thing, we've obviously followed it like a lot of other folks, but that was not reasonable for our interest in Winter Bros.\nKevin Chen : Okay. And just maybe a clarification, just those intermodal assets, does that create a platform for future? I mean, I know you have a lot on your plate now, just kind of thinking further out, or is that primarily something you'd use for kind of internalizing waste, diversion -- sorry, go ahead.\nJim Fish : Certainly their ability to move waste off of Long Island in modes other than truck transportation was certainly something that was appealing to us, and we view that as, like I said, as some of the disposal constraints continue to grow on Long Island. Their capabilities on Long Island, in addition to the network of assets we have that can receive intermodal waste, was a key contributor in terms of the strategic outlook for us acquiring that business.\nKevin Chen: Perfect. That's it for me. Best of luck in the back half of this year.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question, coming from the line of James Schumm from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJames Schumm : Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on the landfill revenues are sort of just up modestly, look like the tons were mostly flat. It's just curious what you're seeing in pricing trends for landfills?\nJohn Morris: I think, you know, we talked earlier about C&D is actually positive net of the lapping of the, and the volume's continued to be strong. If you're talking about the yield spread clearly there's a little difference in our yield outlook for landfill volume this quarter versus last quarter. But that's really, that was really distinctive and showed up in one of our areas that took on a good chunk of volume, great business, but an average lower rate. And that has more to do with the geography of where the volume came in from. So we see, in terms of our overall landfill volume, they're still positive. We still see decent trends on the landfill volume side. And if you look at it from a core price standpoint, which is really what we were focused on. If you look at both the landfill and the transfer station core price, you don't see any deviation there. So we're continuing to drive value in terms of the quality of revenue we're bringing into our post collection facilities.\nJim Fish: Yeah. James, I just to add a little bit to that, I, what John said there, I mean, sometimes it gets lost, but, but these different geographies have different rates and this happened to be a pretty big pickup about 20% pickup in MSW. And as John said, it was, it was good, very good for this area, but that area happens to have an average rate well below the average rate for the company. And that's driven by market conditions. That's driven by, by capacity competition, all of those things, this area, which picked up this, this nice bump in MSW is well below that market rate. So when you look at yield, which includes mix, the yield calculation reflects that. That's why John talks about core price because core price takes out the mix effect. Core price is essentially flat. If you look at Q2 of '23 versus Q2 of '24, essentially flat. Well, yield was down a bit and the yield was really mixed related.\nJohn Morris: And the last thing I would add is, look at our special waste volume that continued to be strong through Q2 as well. Right.\nJames Schumm : Okay, great. Thank you for that. With, with respect to R&G, there were some news reports out there that I think misled some investors a little bit. There was a report that said you could potentially sell your R&G portfolio for $3 billion. You later said you were offended by that price, which made sense to us because the price would seem way too low, but is there any color you can provide about the strategy going forward with the R&G assets, you know, given the large purchase of Stericycle now?\nJim Fish: I'm still offended by that number. I think the way I we'd look at that is as we've said all along, this business is really a natural byproduct of our landfills. It's one that provides significant margin accretion for a strong EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. All of those good things that we like, that we talk about it. And last but certainly not least, it adds to our sustainability focus that we really made, kind of a tenant of our strategy a few years back. So all of those things are really good. We've said kind of all along, everything is for sale at a price, but I would tell you $3 billion is not that price. In fact, it's a long way from that price. So right now our focus has been those 20 plants. I talked about kind of where we are on those, and, you know, we've got two that are out there, three I guess that are out there, and we'll have another four coming online this year. We're in process of construction on all of those. As I said in kind of my extra comments to Tyler's question, almost three-quarters of that CapEx is going to be spent by the end of the year, and only 15% of the EBITDA will have been realized. So that's why 2025 and '26 really look like there's going to be a big step up there, not just from R&G, but also the recycling investments. So, again, I know the Reuters article was out there, $3 billion, anything that we own is for sale at the right price. And if somebody threw a gigantic number at us, we would look at it. But for now we're focused on building out the remainder of those 20 plants. Tara has talked about the fact that we've got potential for kind of phase 2, some of these other landfills that are not in that 20. We're evaluating those as well. We're super excited about the R&G business and the recycling rebuilds that we're doing.\nJames Schumm : Yep. That makes sense. That's clear. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nJim Fish : Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Stephanie Moore from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I do want to follow-up on maybe Tyler's question at the beginning, and I don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but I think it's important. You know, and I agree. I think, you know, Jim, you're exactly right. It's certainly a blockbuster year with 10% growth. It's really strong. I think, where we're coming from, and this is probably part of all of our problems is that we're always kind of looking for more or where you could see that kind of incremental EBITDA growth. And I think, as you alluded to and Tyler alluded to M&A seems to be a little bit better. Commodity dollars are a little bit better. The underlying business is performing well. So I think, what would be helpful is maybe if you could talk through areas where it's been a little bit maybe worse than expected or slightly negative. Obviously, we call that a little on the volume front, but anything else that suggests potentially maybe not as strong as everything else, which clearly, quite frankly firing kind of on all cylinders. So helpful there. Sorry for it's long-winded. Thank you.\nJim Fish: No, no, no. It's a good question. Look, there's always ups and downs, puts and takes in the business. There's hardly ever, in fact, there may never be a year where every single thing we look at goes up. And you touched on the one which we've talked about a bit this morning, which is volume. Volume is softer than we expected coming into the year. We thought it would be approaching 1%. Now it's more flat, but we've offset that. And that's the encouraging part for us is not only have we offset it, but expecting 1% volume growth and 7% -- I think 7.6% was our original guidance on the EBITDA line. And now we're saying, okay, oops, volume is not going to be approaching 1%. It's going to be flat. Oh, but by the way, EBITDA is going to be 10%, approaching 10%. So while not everything is going in the right direction, and there's a couple of other things. We did mention the fact that some minor delays in some of these plants. They're minor delays, but they're not opening exactly when we said they would open. They're still, you know, the five that we committed to opening in '24 are still going to open in '24, but slightly minor delays. I think the impact of that is about $11 million negative. So that's been a negative force, but in no way, shape, or form does that indicate that we're experiencing long-term delays in these projects where we feel like we're on a really good track for construction of those plants. So, yeah, you know, there's been a couple of things. One thing that we don't talk about, for example, is the fact that when you rebuild these recycle plants, there's a shutdown cost for that. And by the way, you're shutting down in a really good commodity price environment. So that ends up in kind of a strange way being a pickup for us. As we get into 2025, there won't be as much of a shutdown cost as there was in 2024. But '24, it's why I've kind of tried to pound the table a little bit on how impressive 10% is. We've got some delays that have amounted to call it 11 million bucks. We've got some shutdown costs that are, you know, you're going to have a shutdown cost because you have to shut the plant down in order to retool it. So there are a few negatives out there. You know, could we have a higher tax rate depending on who gets in office in November? Yes. But really the only thing that to us that looks kind of negative and doesn't seem to have prospects for improvement is that kind of industrial temp roll off business. I'm not sure I see that bouncing back in 2025, but I am. That doesn't mean I'm not incredibly bullish about 2025. I just think we have to offset it just the way we've done this year.\nStephanie Moore : Got it. I'll leave it at that. Thank you so much.\nJim Fish: Yep.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Toby [indiscernible]. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. On the acquisition front, I'm wondering if you could kind of look through the lens of the other people that you're speaking with in terms of prospects and what are the pressures they're feeling on the business over the last couple of years? You know, supply chain technology investments and some others have been pressuring them, and perhaps driving them to the table to have dialogues with yourselves and others. How do you see that currently and into next year?\nJohn Morris : I think Toby, you hit on one of them on a supply chain and we go back to that for a second. But first let's start with labor. I mean, you know, we still see pressure on a lot of those frontline contributing jobs and I'm sure that they're enduring some of the same pressure there. We've been fortunate and had the capacity to really make some big changes in terms of wages and overall comp packages, etc. And you're seeing it show up in our turnover, which reduces training, improves safety, reduces our labor, etc. I'm sure that's one area where they're seeing pressure. I think there's still a little bit of overhang. You talk to some of these folks on the supply chain side where they've got to recapitalize their fleet or their business. That cost is certainly not getting any cheaper. So those are a few areas we think about when we're seeing some of this activity. But I think Jim really hit on something that was important. I mean, the pipeline is strong. You know, we're on track probably to finish around a $1billion-plus of tuck in acquisitions. We've got obviously three quarters of that done already, but we've continued to be disciplined and make sure that we're, we're filling in white space or buying assets and companies in areas where we see real growth opportunities. And that's why you hear about Arizona, Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, etc.\nUnidentified Analyst: I want to dig into something you said, can the labor expense trend and that decelerating growth related to, you know, retention and less training expense, et cetera. Can that momentum continue into next year?\nJohn Morris : Well, I think I would, I would tell you is, is if you look at our labor trend over the last handful of quarters, it's certainly trended through Q2 and it's a handful of things. It's lower turnover. That leads to some of that labor pressure, easy, right? You're, you're hiring less people. You're training less people. Your efficiency is naturally better with someone who's experienced behind the wheel of a vehicle as is your safety performance. And that's why you continue to hear us talk about it. And the fact that we're, you know, hovering in the, in the, in the high teens for turnover, not only is that low considering what we were dealing with post COVID, but those are historic lows. So we're going to continue to stay intently focused on that. Cause that is driving the labor benefit.\nJim Fish : Well, in addition, sorry, I was just going to say, in addition to what John said there, you know, we, we still have call it 50% of the, the way to go on our conversion from rear load to ASL. And in just about every one of those cases, you have a labor benefit. Well, in every case you have a labor benefit. In most cases, you have a labor benefit because you don't have a helper on the back of that truck. So that helper comes off, but at the same time you're picking up 30% more homes with an automated side loader versus a rear loader. So in addition to the technology that John and team have brought on board that, that is producing efficiency growth in these lines of business and, and you know, technology driven pickup, you also get this, this pickup when you're shifting from manual collection to automated collection.\nJohn Morris: So the last point I would make on that is we've talked over the last two-plus years about reducing some of the labor intensity from those frontline individual contributor roles that are getting harder to fill and more expensive. You know, we're closing in on 2000 of those positions that we don't need to fill anymore. And we'll be over 2000, call it 2200 to 2300 by the end of the year. And we're approaching sort of the halfway point of what we projected that we could remove the need for as many as 5,000 of those roles. And those are really frontline contributor roles. And again, it's important. It's not like we're walking a single person out the door. Those are folks who are not necessarily lined up anymore to come in the front door. And we're finding ways to use technology and automation to, to replace that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of David Manson [ph] from Baird. Your line is open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the time. Relative to your strategic intent. For Stericycle, about a third of what you're planning to acquire is document destruction. Could you provide some thoughts on how shredded fits in the WM portfolio?\nJim Fish : Yeah. Look, I think the shredded business, we look at that as being complimentary to our own recycling business. It, it wasn't a reason to buy stair cycle, but it certainly wasn't a reason to not buy Stericycle either. I think there, you know, the automation that the terrorists talked about coming into those plants can really be a benefit to the Stericycle business. And by the way, the fact that we're. We're the biggest recycler out there is it matters to size matters in this respect. So we're able to potentially command a better price that we get paid for our material than might a smaller customer of, of those companies like a stair cycle. We process a lot of paper in addition to other commodities. So, so I think there's a couple of places where we really feel like this is going to where we can bring expertise, but we also bring size, which, which makes a difference on, on potentially on price.\nJohn Morris : And you made the point earlier, Jim, it's routes and customers. It's worth line of business, got a lot of similarities to what we already do in our three collection lines of business. And that's an opportunity for us to get under the covers here. Once we, once we get to that point.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yep. Thank you. Best of luck.\nJim Fish : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Brian Butler from Stifel. Your line is open.\nBrian Butler : Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I'll try to just make it quick. Most of my questions have been answered just on that, that thought about kind of document destruction, Stericycle, you know, as well as the document destruction. There's also a handful of assets internationally. What are your thoughts on the international assets? Is it just going to keep those and run them? Or is that an opportunity for growth that you're looking at? Or, or maybe is that really more of a divestiture scenario?\nDevina Rankin : So, as Jim said on the document destruction side, you know, it certainly wasn't the reason to buy Stericycle, but it's also not something that we're looking at from a divestiture perspective. I would tell you that when we think about the, the role that their international footprint can play for WM, we've always been intentional about keeping our eye on the U.K. in particular, with respect to traction that they get from a sustainability and recycling perspective. And we've done that more from afar. And this gives us a more active position in an important market to be sure that we're keeping pace with sustainability objectives, more broadly.\nJim Fish : Excellent question, Michael. I mean, Brian, sorry.\nBrian Butler : That's a compliment. I'll take it. I'll leave it there though. Thank you very much.\nJim Fish: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Now, next question coming from the line of Sabahat Khan from RBC. Your line is open.\nSabahat Khan : Great. Thanks. So just one, one on my part, I'm afraid a lot of color on just your optimism on '25, you know, as you think about next year, you're able to share maybe some color on, are there, you know, maybe it's the cyclical side of the volume market that might be picking up some areas of improvement. Is it the pricing that you have some visibility? If you can maybe just hash out to the extent possible on, you know, what's driving the optimism on '25, as you, as you head into the back end of this year. Thanks.\nJim Fish : Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, we're, we're just in end of July here. So it's a little bit hard to say. I did say that. I don't, I can't tell you I'm super optimistic about the industrial side of, of the business, the roll off side. But by the way, I mean, you know, there's kind of no room to the only direction is up on that business. At this point, it's been pretty soft. But everything else seems to be, I think pretty good. Pricing is, is, you know, something we're, we're pretty good at. And, and, and we use data and analytics, I think quite well as we, as we implement, you know, kind of our -- our pricing changes. So I don't, I don't see any reason to, to, to be concerned about pricing for next year. Volume itself. We'll know a bit more as we get to, you know, get closer to 25 and how the overall kind of economy is, what's the, what the economy is going to look like. But look, I, I think, I think roll off is, is, you know, I don't think it's going to be worse. Commercial is a, one of the early questions was about the consumer. I think the consumer looks pretty strong and I don't see any reason why the consumer won't continue to be strong next year. And then, you know, look, we're adding a business in Stericycle that we do think has a, a stronger growth trajectory, even in the solid waste business, just by nature of where they're, where they are. So I, I'm, you know, fairly encouraged by the volume outlook, but I'll, I'll be able to tell you more as we get closer.\nDevina Rankin : The only, the only other thing I would add is 2025 really should be a big year for us and the sustainability related investment, seeing them roll through. Jim mentioned the seven of the 20 plans that will be online by the end of '24 will represent roughly 30% of our, our EBITDA of the $510 million that we had had told you about. And we have a similar story on the recycling plants, and we should get a bit of a tailwind from the shutdown costs that we've been incurring in 2024. So a lot of momentum, I would say on the sustainability investment side.\nSabahat Khan : Great. Thanks very much for the color.\nJim Fish : You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. And I'm showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Jim Fish, President and CEO for any closing remarks.\nJim Fish : Okay, well, thank you all for your questions this morning. I hope we gave a sufficient amount of color and we're able to demonstrate our, our reasons for our optimism, both for this year and for the coming years beyond '24. So thanks again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Fish",
            "content": "Okay, thanks, Ed, and thanks for joining us. Our results for the quarter were fueled by strong operating performance in the collection and disposal business. We once again achieved double-digit operating EBITDA growth in the second quarter, keeping us on pace to achieve the full-year outlook that we provided last quarter. Quarterly operating EBITDA margin reached 30% for the first time in the company's history, driven by operating efficiencies from technology investments and the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy. We're pleased with our performance in the first half of 2024 and are well-positioned to deliver another year of strong financial results. Our team's executing very well on our strategic priorities, as evidenced by the expected growth in operating EBITDA, approaching 10% for the full year. A big part of our strategic approach to growth is to find future opportunities where we can leverage our own expertise, whether it's using technology to improve our routing efficiencies, turning landfill gas into renewable natural gas, or automating recycling plants to drive greater throughput and lower operating costs. Each of these recognizes a future need and capitalizes on it. And now our recently announced agreement to acquire Stericycle presents another opportunity to leverage our expertise to drive higher growth. Stericycle has a leading position in the growing medical waste industry. The planned acquisition adds complementary business platforms to further our leading suite of comprehensive waste and environmental solutions. And these strategic benefits are accompanied by attractive financial benefits. Our team is progressing through the regulatory approval process and integration planning, and we're excited to welcome Stericycle's team members to WM. Even as we add medical waste as a new vertical within our business to complement our existing collection and disposal business, we continue to position our solid waste network for future growth. As we've said, the pipeline for solid waste tuck-in acquisition opportunities was strong coming into 2024. Our teams worked hard to move tuck-in acquisitions to completion, and we've now closed more than $750 million of solid waste acquisitions through July. These transactions strengthen our core collection and disposal operations in North America in new geographies like Long Island, New York, and complement existing operations through tuck-in acquisitions in growth markets in Florida, North Carolina, and Arizona. We also continue to execute well on sustainability, our sustainability growth investments. We expect to bring five new renewable natural gas projects online in 2024, adding to the two new facilities completed in 2022 and 2023. We have another nine projects in active construction, with construction beginning or expected to begin on the remaining four facilities later this year. Momentum is building, and we're excited about the progress we're making. Investing directly in building our renewable natural gas platform meets all of our investment criteria. We're driving strong returns with expected payback periods of three years or four years at better multiples than traditional M&A. Plus, we're expanding environmental benefits by collecting and beneficially using more landfill gas, and we're strengthening our core business by positioning our landfill assets as community energy partners. Looking forward, we're exploring the scale of opportunity in future project development, and growth from our renewable energy business across our landfill network. At the same time, we continue to maximize the value of the renewable energy we produce through a balanced marketing strategy that leverages the transportation and voluntary markets to secure returns, reduce risk, and manage volatility. These efforts demonstrate our commitment to scaling this unique growth opportunity to create long-term value for the environment and shareholders alike. Turning to recycling our investments and automating our existing facilities and building capacity in new markets is helping differentiate WM with customers, unlocking new opportunities to further expand our network, such as recent success [indiscernible]. At the same time, our automation investments are providing consistent financial results, improving labor costs per ton by 30% to 35%, and increasing the blended value on commodity sales by 15% to 20%. We completed our Pittsburgh and Atlanta automation projects during the second quarter, and both facilities ramped up quickly. We're on track to complete another seven automation projects and add new facilities in New York, Florida, and Portland by year end. Our progress to date increases our capacity from our recycling investments by more than a 1 million tons. The WM story is one of delivering on our commitments. We achieved strong results in the first half of 2024, and are positioned to continue that trajectory during the balance of the year. As we kick off our planning process for next year, we have some early enthusiasm about 2025. Based on all the opportunities we discussed today, we're particularly bullish on the long term. It's our dedicated team that makes all of this possible, and I want to thank them for all of their contributions. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results. So, Tyler, Jim here, let me just give you a little bit of extra color here. The 25 that Devina referenced in kind of our forecast over the revised guidance number of 6,450 that we gave last quarter, that 25 has some of what John talked about, which is the Winter Bros acquisition. We'll get five months-ish of that. We already had baked into our original guidance some M&A EBITDA and revenue, but can't say we baked in Winter Bros. So, you're going to get part of that. You're going to get, as Devina said, you're going to get some of the sustainability stuff, which, by the way, is working both ways for us. I mean, we get some commodity pickup. We also are seeing a few minor delays in a couple of the R&G plants. We're still building five R&G plants for the year, as we said we would, but 30 days or so of delay is impacting us. So, all of that adds up to the 25. I think Devina's point, though, is really worth really reiterating here. I mean, you're talking about almost 10% EBITDA growth, and to some degree, I feel like we have a great story to tell, and sometimes we aren't great storytellers, because I feel like we've got 10%, which is the strongest EBITDA growth, probably back to the 1990s. I'm sure the company grew by more than 10% in 1982, but since the 1990s, that's the strongest EBITDA growth we've ever seen, and yet we're doing it. You remember in 2019, when we said we grew EBITDA between 5% and 7%, we said, at the top end of the range, that's going to be in a really robust economy, where we're seeing, you know, 2-plus percent volume growth. We're not seeing 2-plus percent volume growth. We're flat on volume, and yet, in an economy that's kind of stumbling along, honestly, and yet we're growing EBITDA by 10%. Almost all of that, except for that $25 million-ish or whatever that number is for us, almost all that's coming from organic growth. Same with last year. We grew by 7% last year, and it was almost all organic growth. It's coming from those things that we've talked about in the past. You know, you remember a couple years ago, we started talking about technology, probably five years ago. We're going to talk, we're going to bring technology to bear, and we're going to really make a commitment to sustainability, and we're going to put operating processes in place, improve efficiencies, we're going to get smarter with pricing through data analytics, all that stuff, and I remember on the earnings call getting questions like, okay, that's great, Jim. When are we going to see the impact on the bottom line? You are seeing the impact on the bottom line. When you see 10% EBITDA growth, 160 basis points of margin growth, and still 5-ish percent revenue growth, it's all coming from price, you are absolutely seeing that kind of strategic growth, and then at the same time, we're doing some acquisitions. I mentioned in my script where we're filling holes, either where we weren't before, or adding to really strong strategic positions like Texas, like Florida, like North Carolina, Tennessee, you could go down the list, Arizona, and then you've all seen a deck on Stericycle. I mean, Stericycle is basically a fourth line of business for us. We've got resi, we've got commercial, we've got industrial, now we've got medical. And with Stericycle comes significant opportunities for synergy and comes with a higher growth trajectory in medical waste than in the solid waste space. So we're very excited about that, which basically gets me to a 25 number, and 2025 we'll give you guidance in February. But I could not be more bullish when I think about 2025, when you add all those things up. I mean, think about these sustainability investments. Tara will tell you we've spent probably three-quarters of the capital, or we will have by the end of the year, and we will have only realized 15% of the EBITDA. So 2025, I don't care who gets elected in November. Well, I do, but it doesn't matter who gets elected in November. And it doesn't matter whether we have geopolitical problems. It doesn't matter whether the economy is up or down. We're going to have a blockbuster year in 2025. We'll talk about it in February. But that's on top of what we consider to be a blockbuster year this year. So a bit longer answer than I think you were bargaining for when you got on when you were first in the queue. But I just want to make sure everybody understands all that. Okay. So, Toni, real quickly, you know, Tara did a great job of answering that and she's absolutely right. I would just tell you, we've always said, no matter who's in office, we're pretty agnostic about that. I mean, we all have our own personal preferences, but the business itself does really well in just about any regulatory environment, short of somebody coming in and saying, you know, landfills are closed all tomorrow morning. But short of that, we are pretty agnostic with respect to regulation, whether it's the Chevron doctrine, whatever it is, we do well in just about any environment. It wasn't insignificant to my heart [ph] It was more significant at my house, but as far as the business, it's not going to be material. Thanks. Good morning, Jerry. Yeah, Jerry, it's a little hard to tell at this point. One thing I can tell you is that Stericycle has talked a lot about the fact that as they roll out new systems that those systems will give them better visibility. And boy, we absolutely concur with that. I mean, you know, we like the fact that our systems give us a lot of visibility all the way down at the customer level. So we don't really know what that means in terms of pricing at this point because we haven't had a chance to kind of stick our head under the covers. But we do know that the better the visibility, the smarter you can be with data and analytics and with pricing. Yeah, you know, I mean, I think this is really kind of an outsider looking in because, again, we're not, you know, we don't own the business yet. And we really, for the most part, are looking at public documents. We're starting to go through an integration process where we get to look at some things. But I would tell you that if we look at kind of the medical industry, not just medical waste but medical services, and as you look at the United States or you look at Canada or you look at just about any country, the U.K., France, Germany, I mean, all those countries are getting older. And so that would seem to be a positive for the volume of services in that industry. And commensurate with that, you would expect to see medical waste increase at a similar pace. So why their volumes have been a bit slower than expected, it's hard for me to say. But I sure do look at the future of this and say, this is a business that should have a very strong volume trajectory to it. I do think it will be helpful as we start to look at their customer base. They have a lot of customers that are moving towards kind of larger national account-type customers. And we're very good at national accounts. Our national accounts business has really been a driver of our growth over the last kind of five years to ten years. So as you look at their business that's going, in large part, from these small-quantity generators to more large-quantity generators, the UNHs and the HCAs and companies like that, I think that's right in our wheelhouse. Yeah, so it's a good question, Noah. You know, Rafa Carrasco, our officer here, is going to be running this for us, and Rafa is kind of right into the process of looking at what do the synergies look like for this deal. We said $125 at the start. We didn't really give kind of a breakdown of when we realized those. Some of those, obviously, you know you get up front, whether it is some internalization benefits on the disposal side. It's also, you know, some of the SG&A piece. But we do think that, as we said kind of early on, that the $125 is, you know, you can do some math to get to a point where you say that's pretty conservative, even if you're just looking at the SG&A line. We built in 300 basis points on the SG&A line, and their guidance for the year was 22% SG&A as a percent of revenue. And you know where ours is. I mean, we're at 9%. And by the way, as I think Davina said a couple of times, you probably should compare them not to the 9% but to what our areas run at. Our areas run at like 5%. So you can do some math and get to a much bigger number than 125, but that's what Rafa and his team are doing right now is determining, all right, what do the synergies look like? What comprises the $125? Is the $125 twice as big as that? I mean, what is that number? And then to your point, when do we get it? Is it, you know, we've kind of said three years to get there, but you may have most of it coming in year one. You may have most of it coming in year two. We don't quite know yet. That's where he's digging in. We will give quite a bit more color on this. First of all, once we own the business, we'll give a lot more color on it. And secondly, we'll give more color and we'll give guidance in February. Yeah, that's a great question. And I think the consumer has been pretty resilient through all of this, through COVID, through kind of the rebound, and through a bit of a -- look, it's not been a bad economy, but it just hasn't been a -- it certainly hasn't been a blockbuster economy. The consumer has been very resilient, and that's been the encouraging part. I think it shows up when you look at our kind of more small and medium businesses, which are reflected in our commercial. You know, the commercial line of business has been fairly strong for us on the volume side. Resi has been soft, but Resi is not really driven by consumer behavior. Resi has really been driven by John Morris, and John's been really working on improving margins in that line of business. The real softness has been in that temp roll-off, more industrial space. You know, if you look at our numbers, C&D has been soft, but a lot of that is just difficult comps because of the big Florida hurricane last year. Special waste has been pretty good. MSW has been quite good. So we're actually not that disappointed with flat volume, but it's just not the 2% to 3% that we kind of talked about, you know, in 2019 at the last investor day. I would tell you that the consumer seems to be resilient, seems to be fairly strong, so all of that's good for us. One last quick point here when you talk about Stericycle. We really haven't talked that much about the operating side of this, but look, I think there's a real opportunity on the operating side. John's talked a lot about the efficiencies that we're bringing in the solid waste space, the technology that we're bringing to bear. All of that has application in the medical waste space, too, because they really run trucks the same way we run trucks. Yep. Well, I'll start backwards, Kevin. I think with respect to New York City, we've been a long-term licensed Operator in New York City since the mid-'90s. So that's not the reason why Winter Bros was attracted to us. They're certainly the premier environmental service provider on Long Island. I think you hit on a couple of key things. One, it's a white space for us. It was sort of new real estate. It's not a secret that the Long Island market has got some disposal constraints that are growing at the end of this year with the planned closure of Brookhaven Landfill. They've got intermodal assets and capabilities that play very well into our network capabilities. And on top of that, the business runs really well standalone. So for us, we're really fortunate to have those folks join the WM team. They run about 150 routes out there. It's about 500 employees. So we're excited about that. In terms of the commercial waste zone thing, we've obviously followed it like a lot of other folks, but that was not reasonable for our interest in Winter Bros. Certainly their ability to move waste off of Long Island in modes other than truck transportation was certainly something that was appealing to us, and we view that as, like I said, as some of the disposal constraints continue to grow on Long Island. Their capabilities on Long Island, in addition to the network of assets we have that can receive intermodal waste, was a key contributor in terms of the strategic outlook for us acquiring that business. Yeah. James, I just to add a little bit to that, I, what John said there, I mean, sometimes it gets lost, but, but these different geographies have different rates and this happened to be a pretty big pickup about 20% pickup in MSW. And as John said, it was, it was good, very good for this area, but that area happens to have an average rate well below the average rate for the company. And that's driven by market conditions. That's driven by, by capacity competition, all of those things, this area, which picked up this, this nice bump in MSW is well below that market rate. So when you look at yield, which includes mix, the yield calculation reflects that. That's why John talks about core price because core price takes out the mix effect. Core price is essentially flat. If you look at Q2 of '23 versus Q2 of '24, essentially flat. Well, yield was down a bit and the yield was really mixed related. I'm still offended by that number. I think the way I we'd look at that is as we've said all along, this business is really a natural byproduct of our landfills. It's one that provides significant margin accretion for a strong EBITDA to free cash flow conversion. All of those good things that we like, that we talk about it. And last but certainly not least, it adds to our sustainability focus that we really made, kind of a tenant of our strategy a few years back. So all of those things are really good. We've said kind of all along, everything is for sale at a price, but I would tell you $3 billion is not that price. In fact, it's a long way from that price. So right now our focus has been those 20 plants. I talked about kind of where we are on those, and, you know, we've got two that are out there, three I guess that are out there, and we'll have another four coming online this year. We're in process of construction on all of those. As I said in kind of my extra comments to Tyler's question, almost three-quarters of that CapEx is going to be spent by the end of the year, and only 15% of the EBITDA will have been realized. So that's why 2025 and '26 really look like there's going to be a big step up there, not just from R&G, but also the recycling investments. So, again, I know the Reuters article was out there, $3 billion, anything that we own is for sale at the right price. And if somebody threw a gigantic number at us, we would look at it. But for now we're focused on building out the remainder of those 20 plants. Tara has talked about the fact that we've got potential for kind of phase 2, some of these other landfills that are not in that 20. We're evaluating those as well. We're super excited about the R&G business and the recycling rebuilds that we're doing. Yep. No, no, no. It's a good question. Look, there's always ups and downs, puts and takes in the business. There's hardly ever, in fact, there may never be a year where every single thing we look at goes up. And you touched on the one which we've talked about a bit this morning, which is volume. Volume is softer than we expected coming into the year. We thought it would be approaching 1%. Now it's more flat, but we've offset that. And that's the encouraging part for us is not only have we offset it, but expecting 1% volume growth and 7% -- I think 7.6% was our original guidance on the EBITDA line. And now we're saying, okay, oops, volume is not going to be approaching 1%. It's going to be flat. Oh, but by the way, EBITDA is going to be 10%, approaching 10%. So while not everything is going in the right direction, and there's a couple of other things. We did mention the fact that some minor delays in some of these plants. They're minor delays, but they're not opening exactly when we said they would open. They're still, you know, the five that we committed to opening in '24 are still going to open in '24, but slightly minor delays. I think the impact of that is about $11 million negative. So that's been a negative force, but in no way, shape, or form does that indicate that we're experiencing long-term delays in these projects where we feel like we're on a really good track for construction of those plants. So, yeah, you know, there's been a couple of things. One thing that we don't talk about, for example, is the fact that when you rebuild these recycle plants, there's a shutdown cost for that. And by the way, you're shutting down in a really good commodity price environment. So that ends up in kind of a strange way being a pickup for us. As we get into 2025, there won't be as much of a shutdown cost as there was in 2024. But '24, it's why I've kind of tried to pound the table a little bit on how impressive 10% is. We've got some delays that have amounted to call it 11 million bucks. We've got some shutdown costs that are, you know, you're going to have a shutdown cost because you have to shut the plant down in order to retool it. So there are a few negatives out there. You know, could we have a higher tax rate depending on who gets in office in November? Yes. But really the only thing that to us that looks kind of negative and doesn't seem to have prospects for improvement is that kind of industrial temp roll off business. I'm not sure I see that bouncing back in 2025, but I am. That doesn't mean I'm not incredibly bullish about 2025. I just think we have to offset it just the way we've done this year. Yep. Well, in addition, sorry, I was just going to say, in addition to what John said there, you know, we, we still have call it 50% of the, the way to go on our conversion from rear load to ASL. And in just about every one of those cases, you have a labor benefit. Well, in every case you have a labor benefit. In most cases, you have a labor benefit because you don't have a helper on the back of that truck. So that helper comes off, but at the same time you're picking up 30% more homes with an automated side loader versus a rear loader. So in addition to the technology that John and team have brought on board that, that is producing efficiency growth in these lines of business and, and you know, technology driven pickup, you also get this, this pickup when you're shifting from manual collection to automated collection. Yeah. Look, I think the shredded business, we look at that as being complimentary to our own recycling business. It, it wasn't a reason to buy stair cycle, but it certainly wasn't a reason to not buy Stericycle either. I think there, you know, the automation that the terrorists talked about coming into those plants can really be a benefit to the Stericycle business. And by the way, the fact that we're. We're the biggest recycler out there is it matters to size matters in this respect. So we're able to potentially command a better price that we get paid for our material than might a smaller customer of, of those companies like a stair cycle. We process a lot of paper in addition to other commodities. So, so I think there's a couple of places where we really feel like this is going to where we can bring expertise, but we also bring size, which, which makes a difference on, on potentially on price. Thank you. Excellent question, Michael. I mean, Brian, sorry. You bet. Yeah. I mean, it's, you know, we're, we're just in end of July here. So it's a little bit hard to say. I did say that. I don't, I can't tell you I'm super optimistic about the industrial side of, of the business, the roll off side. But by the way, I mean, you know, there's kind of no room to the only direction is up on that business. At this point, it's been pretty soft. But everything else seems to be, I think pretty good. Pricing is, is, you know, something we're, we're pretty good at. And, and, and we use data and analytics, I think quite well as we, as we implement, you know, kind of our -- our pricing changes. So I don't, I don't see any reason to, to, to be concerned about pricing for next year. Volume itself. We'll know a bit more as we get to, you know, get closer to 25 and how the overall kind of economy is, what's the, what the economy is going to look like. But look, I, I think, I think roll off is, is, you know, I don't think it's going to be worse. Commercial is a, one of the early questions was about the consumer. I think the consumer looks pretty strong and I don't see any reason why the consumer won't continue to be strong next year. And then, you know, look, we're adding a business in Stericycle that we do think has a, a stronger growth trajectory, even in the solid waste business, just by nature of where they're, where they are. So I, I'm, you know, fairly encouraged by the volume outlook, but I'll, I'll be able to tell you more as we get closer. You bet. Okay, well, thank you all for your questions this morning. I hope we gave a sufficient amount of color and we're able to demonstrate our, our reasons for our optimism, both for this year and for the coming years beyond '24. So thanks again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. We're pleased with the strong start to 2024, particularly when we focus on the three most important financial measures we track, operating EBITDA, operating EBITDA margin, and free cash flow. Starting with operating EBITDA, through the first six months, we have seen this metric grow more than 12%, with all of this growth being organic. This puts us on track to deliver our full year outlook of nearly 10% operating EBITDA growth, well above our long-range annual target of 5% to 7%. As a reminder, in setting our operating EBITDA target for 2024 and then quickly increasing it by $100 million in April, we projected that achieving this year's outsized growth would be driven by two things. The first is the benefits of price and cost optimization in the collection and disposal business, which we expected to be weighted toward the first half of the year. And the second is incremental earnings contributions from our investments in growing our recycling and renewable energy businesses, which would be weighted toward the back half of the year. This is exactly how 2024 is tracking, giving us confidence in meeting or exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range for operating EBITDA, with our current projection being $6.475 billion. This includes about $20 million to $30 million of incremental growth from tech-in solid waste acquisitions in 2024. Turning now to operating EBITDA margin, it's worth highlighting again that at 30%, Q2 is the best quarterly operating EBITDA margin result in our company's history. In the second quarter, total company operating EBITDA margin expanded 130 basis points, and this was driven by about 200 basis points of margin expansion from price and cost optimization efforts in the collection and disposal business, and then a benefit from the sale of non-strategic assets of about 50 basis points. These strong margin results were partially offset by higher risk management costs, an increase in incentive compensation costs, and a modest drag from the net impact of recycled commodity prices and fuel. The key takeaway from looking at these puts and takes is that we saw a 200 basis point lift in our core business versus last year, and we see the benefits of employee retention, truck deliveries, and the use of technology and process to optimize the business that started in the second half of 2023 holding. The significant margin expansion in operating EBITDA growth in 2024 is delivering robust operating and free cash flow growth. Through the first six months of 2024, we've generated cash flow from operations of $2.52 billion, and that's an increase of nearly $450 million or 22% compared to the same period in 2023. Our double-digit operating EBITDA growth, favorable working capital trends, and lower cash incentive compensation payments are driving this strong performance. For the first half of the year, capital expenditures to support the business totaled $947 million. Sustainability growth investments were about $388 million. Both are tracking a plan that we anticipate spending at or slightly above the high end of our prior guidance of between $850 million and $900 million for sustainability growth investments in 2024. Pulling this all together, we've generated $1.24 billion of free cash flow in the first six months of the year, and we're confident that we will achieve our guidance range of between $2 billion and $2.15 billion of free cash flow in 2024. As Jim mentioned, we've closed more than $750 million in Truck-In acquisitions through July, and we look forward to closing the acquisition of Stericycle as early as the fourth quarter of this year. Given our elevated M&A activity, we want to reiterate our capital allocation priorities and emphasize our commitment to a strong balance sheet. WM has a disciplined approach to allocating capital to strategic growth opportunities, including the capital needed to sustain and grow our core solid waste businesses and investments that we're making to grow our recycling and renewable energy assets. We prioritize return on invested capital in making these decisions, and we expect all of our investments to provide healthy returns above our cost of capital. We also remain committed to growing shareholder returns, which includes increasing the dividend as free cash flow grows. We intend to finance the Stericycle transaction using a combination of bank debt and senior notes. When combining the impacts of the $750 million of solid waste Tuck-In acquisitions with the funding of Stericycle, we now expect our leverage to be about 3.6 times post-close. In light of this elevated leverage, we're temporarily suspending our share repurchase program so that we can work our way back through our targeted leverage range of 2.75 times to 3 times, about 24 months after the close of Stericycle. The slight revisions in our projected leverage figures since our announcement of the planned acquisition of Stericycle are updates that reflect the impact of layering on the additional Tuck-In acquisition activity this year. We're steadfast in our commitment to debt investors and rating agencies because we know the value of our strong investment grade credit profile. To wrap up, we're very pleased with our strong results, and I know the WM team remains hard at work to deliver on all of our goals for 2024. With that, Livia, let's open the line for questions. Good morning. So, I'll start by highlighting that the one item that was different than our expectations at the end of April when we spoke about that little north of 30% for Q2 is the risk management impact of 50 basis points in the quarter. So, if we had not had that item, which we couldn't have predicted, we would have come in at or above the target that I provided on the call last time. What I would say about when we look forward to Q3, what's changed a little bit, there's a couple of things. One is recycled commodity prices, and you guys know that we have a different geography than our competitors do with regard to the impact of recycled commodity prices. And that was a 40 basis point headwind in the quarter, and we expect elevated commodity prices to continue into the back half of the year. So, there is a little bit of a headwind that we weren't projecting from recycling brokerage in particular that would carry over. And then, in addition to that, with lower industrial volumes that John mentioned, the flow through on industrial volumes is generally strong 40% levels. And so, that again is one of the things that created a headwind in the quarter and that would impact Q3. The third item relates to the Tuck-In acquisition contributions. As you know, based on where we are in integration processes, integrated M&A revenue and activity tends to come in in early innings at a lower contribution margin than our base business. So, what I would say is that right now our Q3 outlook is in the range of 30.5% to 31% with all those things taken into account. So, in terms of overall EBITDA growth for the year, what I would say is, when we look at the first half of the year, right, the first half of the year, Solid Waste EBITDA has grown $415 million. Quite remarkable. The headwind that I talked about in risk management, it shows up in the corporate and other category. And so, what you see is, you know, there was more of an offset to that Solid Waste growth in the first -- in the second quarter than what we experienced in the first quarter. But the sustainability businesses, we still expect to be on track to generate that $115 million of EBITDA contribution to the year. And when we think about what happened over the second quarter that may not be showing up as a direct increase in that amount, it really is a put-and-take story. One is the value, the incremental value we expect from higher commodity prices in the recycling business, partially offset by the impact of a slowdown in some of the construction projects on the renewable energy business. Now, we're talking weeks, not months here, right? This is contributions that we now expect to start to ramp more in the fourth quarter than what we were expecting earlier in the second half of the year. So, all-in-all, what I would tell you is the EBITDA growth story for us is approaching 10% in the year, and still most of that coming from the solid waste business, with the contributions coming from the sustainability business, in total tracking according to plan, though there was a put-and-take. It's insignificant. We had our quarterly business reviews with the Texas market, who was hit the hardest, and they've made projections. But at this point, it's not expected to be material. Yeah. We all felt more significant within the business world. Yeah. Good morning, Jerry. Sure. So in terms of what we experienced in the second quarter, you know, this is a business where we say safety is priority one and getting our team members home safe every day is the most important job that we all do. And I would tell you that, unfortunately, there were some incidents in the second quarter that resulted in reserves associated with some of the, you know, more significant incidences that we can, from time-to-time, incur in our business. It is not representative of long-term trends. It is not representative of something that we expect to repeat. So I would say non-recurring, not out of period. What I would say with regard to the seasonal trends, and I mentioned this when Tyler and I were talking about margins as well, is what's difficult about typical seasonal trends for us is that roll-off is really a big piece of what can drive seasonal trends upward. And we did not see the roll-off volume pickup that we would have expected to see, and we are cautious about that going into the third quarter. Aside from that, we do expect the traditional benefits that you get from higher MSW levels and the commercial collection line of business in particular continues to be really, really strong in terms of both volume growth, price execution, and really strong flow-through from those efficiency gains that we've had. So overall, seasonality expectations are very strong, and we expect that to continue with the exception of the muted roll-off impact. Thank you. So one data point, Noah, that I think is really helpful in terms of thinking about timing and why it would differ from, you know, the timeline that we saw on ADS as an example is that when you think about Stericycle and where they are in their journey, they are just completing their ERP implementation, and we think that there's reason to be cautious with respect to the pace at which we could capture synergies with this business. And Jim did a great job of articulating, you know, some of the work that's going on right now in order for us to be able to fortify our expectations and outlook. But I think that the ERP implementation journey that the Stericycle team has been on is one of the reasons that we're not at a position that we can speak to how quickly we can get there, although you know us well enough to know that we're going to move as fast as we can. Yeah, so it was about $775 million of unusual activity, and it will be disclosed specifically in the 10Q. But basically because of with the lead up to the announcement of the Stericycle acquisition, we were in a period where we had material non-public information, and we could not remarket our tax-exempt bonds to the marketplace. So we had to repurchase our own tax-exempt bonds for a short period of time. That's what that relates to. We've since already successfully remarketed the ones that have been in place or that could have gone back to the market through July, and then we have additional remarketing activity that will happen in the third quarters and fourth quarters where we expect to fully place those back into the marketplace by the end of the year. Yeah, so what I would say is, I would describe the risk management item as a Q2 only item in terms of the magnitude of the 50 basis points headwinds because it was activity-based. It's not something that will be recurring in nature. With regard to tax rate, this is actually a little more complicated question to answer than you might anticipate. But what I would tell you is when we exited Q2, our projection for that is 22%. I'd clarify for you two important things. One is that it includes $145 million of investment tax credit benefits that we expect for the year. And if there is any change in the timing or place and service dates of our renewable natural gas facilities, you could see that change. But that's our best estimate as of right now. And then the second item is, there was a change in accounting in 2024 related to our low-income housing tax credit investment, and that actually has a slight impact on the effective tax rate because of a change in geography on the income statement. And Ed and Heather are happy to talk through that with you in more detail if you would like. Sure. So I would tell you in terms of the portfolio, this was the largest investment of its kind that was remaining in our what you call venture capital type suite of investments. So there's not anything significant that I would tell you is looming here for similar investments. For this one in particular, it relates to the continuous investment that we had made, and you'll recall that this was all about looking for opportunities to divert MSW and see what we could do to create sustainable solutions for MSW. We continue to be focused on ensuring that we are thoughtful about what opportunities exist in the marketplace, and we were optimistic about this one, but the viability of it proved to be different than our initial expectations. So, as Jim said on the document destruction side, you know, it certainly wasn't the reason to buy Stericycle, but it's also not something that we're looking at from a divestiture perspective. I would tell you that when we think about the, the role that their international footprint can play for WM, we've always been intentional about keeping our eye on the U.K. in particular, with respect to traction that they get from a sustainability and recycling perspective. And we've done that more from afar. And this gives us a more active position in an important market to be sure that we're keeping pace with sustainability objectives, more broadly. The only, the only other thing I would add is 2025 really should be a big year for us and the sustainability related investment, seeing them roll through. Jim mentioned the seven of the 20 plans that will be online by the end of '24 will represent roughly 30% of our, our EBITDA of the $510 million that we had had told you about. And we have a similar story on the recycling plants, and we should get a bit of a tailwind from the shutdown costs that we've been incurring in 2024. So a lot of momentum, I would say on the sustainability investment side."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. And good morning. We're pleased with our second quarter results, particularly our ongoing optimization of operating costs. Our teams remain intently focused on delivering safe and reliable service to our customers, and I want to thank them for their dedication, especially those in areas impacted by Hurricane Beryl in early July. Second quarter operating expenses is a percentage of revenue improved by 130 basis points year-over-year to 60.9%. This improvement is a testament to our disciplined management of operating costs and our collection lines of business. Combining our strong operating expense performance with disciplined pricing, we significantly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins. In the second quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew by $203 million, with margin expanding to 37.3%. Our continued adoption of technology and automation was a key driver of these significant operating cost improvements. Specifically, in labor, the use of scheduling and planning tools, advanced mapping technology, expansion of our dynamic routing capabilities, and automation of our residential fleet resulted in improved efficiency across all three of our collection lines of business for the second consecutive quarter. In residential, efficiency improved by nearly 6% in Q2, largely due to fleet automation. Our automated routes achieved over 30% efficiency improvement, contributing to a significant increase in residential operating EBITDA margin when compared to last year. Additionally, our people-first focus led to reduced driver turnover, which improved 300 basis points from a year ago. Company-wide, the integration of technology and improved driver retention contributed to a 90 basis point reduction in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. We remain confident in the value of our technology and optimization efforts, and we expect to continue driving labor cost improvements throughout the year. Turning other operating costs, repair and maintenance spending as a percentage of revenue improved by 20 basis points, reflecting our continued adoption of technology-enabled processes and an improving truck delivery schedule. Lower fuel costs also contributed 20 basis point improvement to operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. We remain committed to optimizing our cost structure to meet both operational and financial objectives, and we're proud of the results we have achieved so far. And finally, turning to revenue growth, our customer lifetime value model continued to drive organic revenue growth from price in line with our full year expectations. Our pricing results relative to plan remain on track, reflecting our team's focus on using customer-specific data and insights to deliver price increases that keep pace with inflation and margin expansion objectives. Churn remains at 9%, and service increases continue to outpace decreases, further reinforcing our execution. On the volume front, trends in commercial collection, MSW, and special waste remain strong in the quarter and are generally aligned with expectations. As are C&D landfill volumes when adjusted for the lapping of volumes related to Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. However, volume in our roll-off line of business is one area where we continue to see a bit of softness. Similar to last quarter, we continue to see moderation in both a temporary business driven by home building, as well as a portion of our permanent roll-off business in the industrial segment. While a few segments of our collection volume are trending a bit behind our full year expectations, our discipline revenue management combined with our strong execution on cost optimization continue to give us ample confidence that we are positioned to deliver strong financial performance throughout the rest of the year. In closing, I want to thank the entire WM team again for their contributions. Their performance so far in 2024 sets us up for continued success. I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our second quarter financial results in further detail. Yeah, Tyler, it's John. Good question. I mean, if you look at what we did in Q2, it was about $77 million of revenue that was acquired. The $750 that we put, that we've all talked about, represents about $300 million of acquired revenue by the end of the year. So, hopefully that clarifies a little bit. And then, what Devina and I talked about is there is some benefit we've talked about in the back half of the year, that $25-ish million that will be a contribution from some of the M&A we've referenced. I think, you know, we talked earlier about C&D is actually positive net of the lapping of the, and the volume's continued to be strong. If you're talking about the yield spread clearly there's a little difference in our yield outlook for landfill volume this quarter versus last quarter. But that's really, that was really distinctive and showed up in one of our areas that took on a good chunk of volume, great business, but an average lower rate. And that has more to do with the geography of where the volume came in from. So we see, in terms of our overall landfill volume, they're still positive. We still see decent trends on the landfill volume side. And if you look at it from a core price standpoint, which is really what we were focused on. If you look at both the landfill and the transfer station core price, you don't see any deviation there. So we're continuing to drive value in terms of the quality of revenue we're bringing into our post collection facilities. And the last thing I would add is, look at our special waste volume that continued to be strong through Q2 as well. Right. I think Toby, you hit on one of them on a supply chain and we go back to that for a second. But first let's start with labor. I mean, you know, we still see pressure on a lot of those frontline contributing jobs and I'm sure that they're enduring some of the same pressure there. We've been fortunate and had the capacity to really make some big changes in terms of wages and overall comp packages, etc. And you're seeing it show up in our turnover, which reduces training, improves safety, reduces our labor, etc. I'm sure that's one area where they're seeing pressure. I think there's still a little bit of overhang. You talk to some of these folks on the supply chain side where they've got to recapitalize their fleet or their business. That cost is certainly not getting any cheaper. So those are a few areas we think about when we're seeing some of this activity. But I think Jim really hit on something that was important. I mean, the pipeline is strong. You know, we're on track probably to finish around a $1billion-plus of tuck in acquisitions. We've got obviously three quarters of that done already, but we've continued to be disciplined and make sure that we're, we're filling in white space or buying assets and companies in areas where we see real growth opportunities. And that's why you hear about Arizona, Texas, the Carolinas, Florida, etc. Well, I think I would, I would tell you is, is if you look at our labor trend over the last handful of quarters, it's certainly trended through Q2 and it's a handful of things. It's lower turnover. That leads to some of that labor pressure, easy, right? You're, you're hiring less people. You're training less people. Your efficiency is naturally better with someone who's experienced behind the wheel of a vehicle as is your safety performance. And that's why you continue to hear us talk about it. And the fact that we're, you know, hovering in the, in the, in the high teens for turnover, not only is that low considering what we were dealing with post COVID, but those are historic lows. So we're going to continue to stay intently focused on that. Cause that is driving the labor benefit. So the last point I would make on that is we've talked over the last two-plus years about reducing some of the labor intensity from those frontline individual contributor roles that are getting harder to fill and more expensive. You know, we're closing in on 2000 of those positions that we don't need to fill anymore. And we'll be over 2000, call it 2200 to 2300 by the end of the year. And we're approaching sort of the halfway point of what we projected that we could remove the need for as many as 5,000 of those roles. And those are really frontline contributor roles. And again, it's important. It's not like we're walking a single person out the door. Those are folks who are not necessarily lined up anymore to come in the front door. And we're finding ways to use technology and automation to, to replace that. And you made the point earlier, Jim, it's routes and customers. It's worth line of business, got a lot of similarities to what we already do in our three collection lines of business. And that's an opportunity for us to get under the covers here. Once we, once we get to that point."

And I think what's important to note related to our R&G business is we're in a very different time than we were in the previous Trump administration. You've really seen a lot more development on plants. We've seen the voluntary market really shore up. And we also have the RVO that is in place through 2025. So if you look at analysts that really cover the R&G industry, by any measure, most are saying that they don't expect a significant decrease in RIN pricing really more solidly in that 250 range in a potential Trump presidency. And as you know, that is well above our investment thesis of $26 per MMBTU."

Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered another quarter of strong financial results to start 2024, powered by outstanding operational performance in the collection and disposal business. Total company operating EBITDA grew nearly 15% in the first quarter, and margin expanded 240 basis points, driven by substantial momentum on cost optimization efforts and disciplined execution on our pricing programs. \n Last quarter, we said the areas of strength in 2024 would look very similar to those of 2023, and that was definitely the case in Q1. Continued traction on cost optimization led to our third consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA margin above 29.5%, with Q1 coming in at 29.6% in the historically lowest margin quarter of the year. This margin result exceeded our expectations and reflects the tangible benefits of technology on our operating costs, the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy and the substantial progress we're delivering on our sustainability initiatives. \n It's our track record in these areas that gives us confidence we're positioned to deliver our highest-ever full year operating EBITDA margin between 29.7% and 30.2%, which is more than 100 basis points of expansion from 2023 at the midpoint. Our ability to convert more of each revenue dollar to earnings and free cash flow allows us to raise our prior outlook for both operating EBITDA and free cash flow by $100 million. \n As we progress through 2024, we're maintaining our focus on 3 priorities: disciplined pricing across each line of business, leveraging technology to permanently reduce our cost to serve our customers, and executing on our strategic investments in sustainability growth. John and Devina will cover more details on where we're seeing traction within the cost structure and where we have further runway, so I want to spend a few minutes on the other 2 priorities, our pricing strategy and the progress we're making in expanding our sustainability businesses. \n Beginning with pricing, we're pleased with the results we've seen from embracing a customer lifetime value model. Our teams are able to leverage customer-specific analysis to understand where a customer is on their journey and design actionable strategies that will extend the customer retention, improve profitability or both. We're confident that we found a winning approach to data-driven decision-making that optimizes price to reflect the value of the services we deliver, the strength of the asset network and our leading commitment to environmental sustainability. Our first quarter results again show that we have the ability to leverage price increases to cover costs and grow margin while also reducing customer churn. \n Shifting to our sustainability businesses. During the quarter, we delivered growth projects across the recycling and renewable energy businesses. This includes completing a large recycling upgrade in Germantown, Wisconsin. The updated facility relies on state-of-the-art equipment that reduces labor costs, increases throughput by 20%, up to 60 tons of material per hour, and improves product quality. We have another 9 upgraded facilities scheduled for completion this year, and we'll be opening 3 new recycling facilities and expanding our industry-leading single-stream network even further. \n Additionally, we've completed a new renewable natural gas facility this quarter at our DFW landfill in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, and we remain on track to commission another 4 new renewable natural gas facilities in 2024. We're also excited to announce that WM was just named the official sustainability partner of Major League Baseball. WM's work with MLB is the first collaboration of its kind between an environmental services company and a professional sports league team -- sports team league. With this partnership, we have the opportunity to offer services to all 30 MLB clubs in the United States and Canada. We expect to leverage our expertise to build comprehensive plans to improve the environmental impact of Major League Baseball and its clubs. \n In closing, I want to thank our WM team for all their hard work during the quarter. I'm immensely proud of their dedication and execution, which have helped achieve such strong financial results. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results. \nJohn Morris: Thanks, Jim, and good morning. In the first quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 60.9%, continuing the positive trend of our disciplined management of operating costs, particularly in our collection business. Through strategic investments in innovative solutions and process optimization, we delivered improvements in operational efficiency, extracted costs, and setting a new standard for managing the middle of the P&L. Combining this strong operating expense performance with the disciplined pricing performance Jim described, we greatly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins. In the first quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew $212 million, and margin expanded 310 basis points to 36.6%. \n As we continue our journey of automation and optimization, we remain committed to harnessing the power of technology to drive sustainable growth, further reduce costs and improve profitability. In the first quarter of 2024, our continued adoption of technology and automation initiatives led to substantial reductions in both labor costs and repair and maintenance expenses. On the labor front, efficiency in all 3 of our collection lines of business improved meaningfully from the first quarter of 2023 as our implementation continues to gain traction. \n As an example, we're seeing nice improvements in performance from our routing efficiency program, next day optimization, or NDO, in our industrial line of business. This tool allows us to more dynamically route and it improves our efficiency, which is reducing our cost to serve and improving our asset planning. Currently, we have deployed NDO at 92% of our collection sites, and the majority of those are already achieving or exceeding efficiency targets. Additionally, we are achieving great results in the automation of our residential routes. Through Q1, we have automated over 650 routes and removed almost 800 rear load trucks since 2022. This has led to upwards of a 30% efficiency gain and residential EBITDA margins approaching 20%. \n The integration of these technology investments, coupled with the benefits of improved driver retention, have resulted in a 135 basis point improvement in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. In the first quarter of 2024, driver turnover improved to about 18%, down from over 22% a year ago. We expect ongoing benefits from continued moderation inflation as well as the investments we're making in our people and processes as we progress through the year. \n Turning to repair and maintenance. In the first quarter, repair and maintenance spending decreased year-over-year for the first time in several years, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved 50 basis points. In addition to our strong process discipline, we are also leveraging technology to reduce these costs. These technologies have enabled us to digitize much of our workflow, beginning with all of our technicians who now have portable technology in their hands. These tools facilitate our ability to assign and track work, drive technician efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve asset utilization. Our results are encouraging, and we see further runway to optimize repair and maintenance costs in the future. \n In addition to great operating cost performance, we continued to deliver top line growth primarily through disciplined execution on our pricing programs. Our customer lifetime value model continues to drive strong organic revenue growth, and our sales metrics in the quarter are a clear indication of our success in profitably growing the collection and disposal business. Churn was near the lowest rate that we've ever seen at 8.5%. New business improved 16% and continues to outpace lost business. Rollbacks remain in the low double digits. Net service increases remained positive, and our net promoter score improved by almost 12% year-over-year. \n Looking at revenue growth, as Jim said, we've seen a strong start to the year in pricing. Volume has been relatively consistent with our original expectations, with the exception of our temporary roll-off business. The softness in this volume category reflects some slowness in the homebuilding and industrial segments of the macro economy. C&D was also impacted with the lapping of volumes related to Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. With that said, our 2 bellwethers for demand, commercial collection and MSW volumes were positive in the quarter, and we also experienced  a nice uptick in special waste tons in the quarter. \n For the full year, we now expect total revenue growth of between 5% and 5.75%. The revision from our prior expectation is driven by 2 things: the softer temporary roll-off volumes mentioned; and a lower outlook for energy surcharge revenue, given the decline in the average diesel cost relative to our expectations. Our pricing remains on track, and in some lines of business, ahead of our original expectations. Our teams delivered outstanding performance in the first quarter, and I can't thank them enough for all their contributions to our success. \n I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our first quarter financial results in further detail. \nDevina Rankin: Thanks, John, and good morning. Growing our adjusted operating EBITDA margin by 240 basis points in the first quarter stands out as the best indicator of WM's strong start to the year. As John discussed, the lion's share of this margin expansion came from the optimization of our operating performance in the collection business, with labor efficiency and improved repair and maintenance costs driving a 270 basis point improvement in our total company margin from the core. \n Our continued focus on managing our back office spending also contributed 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, with SG&A as a percentage of revenue coming in at 9.5%. Commodity impacts in the quarter largely offset each other as fuel price impacts benefited margin by about 40 basis points, and recycling results decreased margin by about 30 basis points, primarily from the impact of higher recycled commodity pricing in the brokerage business. \n The remainder of the margin bridge from Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2024 relates to a headwind of about 60 basis points from the combined impacts of incentive compensation and costs incurred by our corporate team to drive adoption of our optimization programs. Our strong margin and earnings, combined with benefits from working capital and lower cash incentive compensation payments, led to robust growth in first quarter cash from operations. We're starting the year strong with cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue up over 500 basis points to 26.5%, demonstrating the value of our margin expansion to growing the company's cash flow yield. \n Capital expenditures totaled $668 million in the quarter, with both capital spending to support the base business and our investments in sustainability growth tracking as planned. Our first quarter free cash flow of $714 million allowed us to invest across all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned more than $550 million to shareholders, paying more than $300 million in dividends and repurchasing $250 million of our stock. In all of this, we still maintained our leverage ratio at our target levels of about 2.6x. With our strong balance sheet and robust earnings and cash flow outlook, we are well positioned to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth. \n Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.6%, which includes a $37 million benefit from investment tax credits related to the development of renewable natural gas projects. As we noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, our original expectation was that we would see a $120 million benefit in 2024 from the ITC. And we now expect $145 million for the full year. We expect this to benefit both our tax expense and free cash flow in 2024. \n As Jim mentioned, our great start to the year has put us on a higher growth trajectory for the full year than we initially anticipated when we gave guidance last quarter. We're confident that our full year operating EBITDA margin results can exceed the very strong 29.6% we achieved in the first quarter, and that is reflected in our increased outlook for 2024 operating EBITDA and margin. As we think about the balance of the year, we anticipate that outsized earnings and margin growth continues in the second and third quarters from our pricing programs and momentum in operating efficiencies that began late in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to expect that growth in our sustainability businesses will be more weighted to the back half of the year as more recycling and renewable natural gas projects begin operations. \n Pulling these points together, we want to emphasize that $85 million of the $100 million increase in our operating EBITDA guidance for the year is attributable to our team's strong execution on driving efficiency and the improved cost to serve in the collection business. The remaining $15 million is related to higher recycled commodity price expectations for the year. \n To wrap up, we're very pleased to deliver first quarter results that exceeded our own high expectations. Our sustained strong results are a testament to the investments we have made in talent, technology, and assets over the past several years. As always, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus and dedication to delivering on our commitments to our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. \n With that, Towanda, let's open the line for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tyler Brown with Raymond James. \nPatrick Brown: So we've got to come back to the stellar margin performance here. So John, if I just look at collection and disposal EBITDA, I think you said it was up $212 million on maybe only $190 million increase in revenue. So I just want to understand how we're getting such incredible flow-through. I mean, it sounds like you're seeing outright deflation in certain items, but maybe just a little more color. And just to be clear, there wasn't, Devina, any sort of onetime accrual reversal or anything else that really impacted the quarter, is that correct? \nDevina Rankin: So I'll start with the easy one and confirm there were no accrual reversals or onetime items in the first quarter. The only kind of one-timer that we could point out is actually the loss of the Ian volumes from the prior year that would have been a hill to climb from a margin perspective because, as you know, storm volumes come at high margins. So in fact, the $212 million operating EBITDA growth in the collection and disposal business came with 310 basis points of margin expansion to 36.6% in the collection and disposal business. \nJohn Morris: Yes, a little more color, Tyler. I think a few things are occurring. One is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a nice uptick in efficiency in all 3 lines of business from the mid-single digits up to the high single digits for residential. Residential is a really good story. If you look at the table in the back and you see we still traded about 2.9% of the volume down, but we made a good bit more money for the quarter. And I think we're starting to strike a better balance there. \n I mentioned in the prepared remarks, residential margins are approaching 20% at the EBITDA line. I think the M&R piece is certainly worthwhile on touching. Last year, we took delivery of about 1,450 trucks. We'll get about 1,800 this year, and that's having a meaningful impact. We felt like we've been chasing M&R costs and labor related to maintenance and repairs. \n And for us to actually tamp down costs quarter-over-quarter for the year is something, as I mentioned, we haven't done in a number of years. So I think it's been good efficiency, good cost discipline, our pricing remains robust, especially across the collection and disposal lines. So I think a lot of that came together in Q1. And as Devina mentioned, there really was no one-timer that benefited that. That was just strong execution by the team in the field. \nPatrick Brown: Yes, absolutely. Now John, you mentioned 20% resi margin. So can you just remind us where those margins were a few years ago because I believe they're a fair bit lower? And then do you think that those can approach more company average or is this kind of more where you would expect them? \nJohn Morris: Yes. You're testing my memory here, Tyler. But I would say around 10%, 11% is what I recall. And I've said when we started down this journey, if you will, to really rationalize some of the residential business, we wanted residential to compete with commercial and industrial. And while we're not quite there yet, we can see a point where that gets a little bit closer to converging. And I think as that happens, that 2.5% to 3% volume that we've been kind of trading off on average will start to moderate as we get closer to that line. \nPatrick Brown: Okay. And then my last one here, Devina, just want to make sure that we kind of have a level set on Q2. So if I look back historically, margins do typically rise, I don't know, 150, 200 basis points sequentially from Q1 to Q2. Just anything to think about why that wouldn't be the case or can you just help us shape the Q2 margin expectation? \nDevina Rankin: Yes, I think it's a great question. What I would tell you that we're looking at is a little softer climb from Q1 to Q2 in the normal sequential trends but still a marked improvement from Q1. And coming in, I would say, above 30% pretty handily in Q2 and Q3, in particular. We're currently expecting a little north of 30% in Q2 and potentially even north of 31% in Q3. \nJames Fish: Tyler, I think part of that, I'm not sure it's that we're seeing any softening. It's just that we're kind of in uncharted territory here in terms of margin, I mean, which is a good thing, but to have a range that includes -- we've talked about numbers starting with a 3 for a long time, and now we finally have a number that starts with a 3 in our guidance range. So we're just being a little bit cautious about it. We certainly saw the trend that you just mentioned from Q1 to Q2 and on, but as did the field. But we feel like we're being maybe a little cautious as we get into some uncharted territory. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Burgmeier with Citi. \nBryan Burgmeier: I believe you've said revised EBITDA guidance is about $85 million in underlying improvement. I guess there would be a headwind from the roll-off volume, so it's maybe even more than $100 million sort of underlying number. Did fuel costs play a role in the EBIT guidance raise? And maybe just from a big picture, what changed over the last 2 to 3 months that maybe allowed you to realize these savings a little bit quicker than you may have anticipated in your original view? \nDevina Rankin: Yes, great question. I would tell you in terms of the $85 million, it really is predominantly oriented to 2 things. And one, the biggest driver is our cost efficiency performance and the really strong execution on reducing cost to serve that John's talked so much about on labor and repair and maintenance. The other is the strong execution on price, and that's moderately ahead of the expectations that we had when we came into the year, and we think that will hold for the rest of 2024.\n With respect to fuel, it really didn't impact our dollar outlook for the business. What it did impact is our margin outlook for the business. And so the help in margin was 40 basis points in the quarter, and we think that some of that margin help continues into Q2 and Q3. With respect to how we executed in Q1 that gave us confidence in raising the margin outlook, I would tell you, we saw a really strong margin performance in the fourth quarter, really beginning in the third quarter of 2023 but again in Q4.\n And because Q4 and Q1, on a seasonally adjusted basis, tend to be lower volume and lower margin quarters for us, we really wanted to preserve some of the upside potential until we saw some of the normal seasonal upticks in our business in the second quarter. But with the strong performance in the first quarter, we really could not wait to reflect that we now expect a full year that will hit that 100 basis points of margin expansion. \nJames Fish: I mean, I think the risk there, Devina, was as we discussed it, Bryan, the risk was, with such a strong performance, if we didn't raise guidance, there might have been questions on this call about, so is there something that we're not seeing that you're seeing? Is there something that you had that benefited you? And of course, Devina already answered that. The answer was no. But what we were a little concerned, if we didn't raise margin after such a huge margin performance that, by the way, was on the heels of 2 other quarters, that you might start asking questions about it, are we missing something? And you're not missing anything. We're just improving the margin that much. \nBryan Burgmeier: Got it. Last question for me. I know we're waiting for a little bit more detail on the investment tax credits. And it seems like you put a comment in the press release, $37 million in 1Q, $145 million for the year. I guess I'm just curious if that was kind of in line with your original expectations. And are we still kind of tracking for like a $300 million benefit over the course of your investments through 2026? Good luck in the quarter. I'll turn it over. \nDevina Rankin: Great, thank you. So our original expectations for 2024 were $120 million, so our current outlook of $145 million is a $25 million increase of the ITC benefit in 2024 specifically. With regard to our full outlook for ITC capture over the development plan that we have outlined, we are tracking toward the high end of the original range of $250 million to $300 million. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. \nJerry Revich: Really nice performance this quarter. And over time, you folks have consistently expanded margins by 20, 30 basis points per year almost like clockwork. And I'm wondering, as we think about the long-term plan from here, should we be thinking about 2025 as a lower year of margin expansion because we're getting such good price/cost spread this year? Or does that not factor into how you're thinking about the longer-term plan that you folks unveiled, what, 6 or 9 months ago? \nDevina Rankin: It's a great question. And while it's a little too early for us to be looking to specifically set guidance for '25, I do agree with you that there are some fundamentals that would make us a little more cautious to effectively repeating a 20 to 30 basis point margin expansion year-on-year. But that being said, I would tell you there are some fundamentals with respect to what we're seeing that we know have additional runway and growth, and those fundamentals really come on the labor and repair and maintenance side.\n So repair and maintenance, long term, has been below 9% of revenue. In Q1, we're at 9.5%. So 50 basis points of savings across the year is $100 million of EBITDA. So if we could see ourselves get there, I do think that, that's one of the things that could give us some incremental traction above that 20 to 30 basis points long term. The one thing that we don't really have clarity on yet, but we -- based on what we know today will be a headwind, is that the alternative fuel tax credits will expire at the end of 2024. And that's been about a $55 million benefit to our operating expenses on an annual basis. So that could be a headwind that would tamp down our margin for the years ahead. But we really do think there's strong traction in labor and repair and maintenance that will more than offset that headwind. \nJames Fish: Jerry, I think there's some -- it's always going to be a combination of headwinds and tailwinds. Tara's here. She can talk about the fact that we have a bit of a tailwind next year when it comes to recycled shutdowns. I mean, this year, we're going to see somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million, maybe a little less as an impact, a negative impact on us from shutting down these recycled plants while we rebuild them. That drops off pretty significantly next year. So you probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of a $25 million pickup or tailwind next year.\n The other thing that John and I and Devina have all talked a lot about is this kind of reduction in heads but doing it in a low-impact way, so it's just through attrition. And when we think about that, as I look at our actual headcount from '22, it's down over 2,000 people. And none of those people -- we're not -- none of those people were RIF-ed. We're not going through an arbitrary reduction in force. That's just choosing to not replace folks, and we've given about 4 or 5 different categories where that happens.\n But several of those categories are still not complete. One of them John has talked about, which is the shift from rear load to automated side load. Each time you do that, there is a person that is no longer needed on the back of the truck. As you can imagine, we have pretty high turnover there so we just take advantage of that through attrition. Similarly, in Tara's shop and the recycling business, as we rebuild these plants, we're seeing somewhere between a 30% and 40% reduction in labor costs, and so there are some related heads that come out with that.\n So we still, even in '24, have another probably, John, 1,200 total heads that will come out if you combine those 2 categories. And that takes us from 2,000 to 3,200, 3,300. So that's a big, big part of this is that we're doing this in a more labor efficient way, and it really is coming to fruition. \nJerry Revich: Super. And Jim, maybe just to expand on the recycling part of that conversation. So we have the plant downtime this year but also the returns on the CapEx that you folks are delivering. So what level of improvement are you anticipating '25 versus '24? Correct me if I'm wrong, I think the original plan called for something like a $90 million year-over-year benefit. Is that still the plan for '25 versus '24 so we get that on top of the $25 million swing that you spoke to? \nTara Hemmer: I can speak to that. So as we mentioned, we have 13 plants that we expect to bring online this year and another 13 next year, and those remain on track today. If you think about our exit in 2024 related to headcount, we'll be at a point where we've gotten 70% of the headcount out by the end of 2024 on the automation journey. So we should see not just a pickup from shutdown costs but also from the benefit of 30% improvement in labor costs and operating expenses from those plants. \n It's a great example of how we're able to bring to life in some of these communities. We were just up at Germantown last week for the grand opening celebration. And bringing in more capacity is a great way to differentiate WM in these key markets that we operate in. \nJames Fish: So to use a baseball analogy since we just signed a deal with Major League Baseball, Tara, we'll be in the seventh inning? \nTara Hemmer: Exactly, seventh inning stretch. \nJames Fish: All right, perfect. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sabahat Khan with RBC Capital Markets. \nSabahat Khan: A lot of color there on kind of the tangible labor savings. Is there any way to quantify some of the operational efficiencies or savings in terms of the technology investments that you're making, some of the data analytics tools just in terms of how much bps you might expect over 1, 3 years and what you're kind of seeing relative to expectations? \nJohn Morris: Well, I think the one line we can certainly look at, I think Devina had some of that in her prepared remarks, is kind of what the ratio is of direct labor to revenue. We saw a nice improvement there. I think that's a combination of 2 things: one, we've continued to be very disciplined about pricing. We've said we're playing the long game here, and I comment about customer lifetime value. So I think part of the benefit is we've continued to drive quality revenue at the top line across all the collection lines.\n And frankly, the post-collection line is worth noting it didn't come out, but this was our best quarter in history from a landfill pricing standpoint and a transfer station perspective. So the top line is strong. But I mentioned efficiency. And part of what's driving that mid to high single-digit efficiency is the use of technology to drive efficiency.\n Our turnover number's worth commenting on again because we are at all-time lows at about 18%. And that takes a lot of pressure off if you think about the cost, the friction cost of training folks, putting second people in trucks and all those things. So that's another part of it. And we're down about 750 routes year-over-year. And you can look at our volume. Part of it is being driven by the automation of residential. But the rest of it is we are less capital-intensive for basically doing more work in the commercial and industrial lines year-over-year. \nJames Fish: John, you mentioned also, and John mentioned that in his script that 90% of the roll-off line of business has been rolled out on this [ India ], which is the term for our optimization model. But we haven't rolled out commercial and haven't rolled out residential on that model yet, so we still have a fair amount of room to go there. And all of this is -- it was really 4, 5 years ago, an admission by us, that our routing was not as efficient as it could be if we used -- truly used technology to benefit that. I think that's probably the case across the entire industry. And so 4 or 5 years ago, we decided that, that had to change and now you're seeing the fruits of that. \nSabahat Khan: All right, great. And then I guess, as you think about optimizing and I think pricing and some of the data analytics you're using to figure out the right price for the right customer based on their value, do you believe, based on the work you've done to date, that the model is at the right place? I'm sure there's an element of test and learn. But do you think you've got the right factors? What's sort of your data telling you in terms of how well that model is working? \nJames Fish: I think we -- look, there's always room for improvement so I would not tell you that we're -- that we've perfected this. But from when I was a price guy back in the early 2000s, it's night and day. I think the team has done a spectacular job using data and analytics to their benefit and making sure that we are looking at the customer who really drives the decision as opposed to driving the decision just purely based on a number that we needed to hit in our price metrics. So I would tell you that we've made a ton of progress there. Are we perfect? We're not, but so much better than we used to be. \nJohn Morris: I would say, Jim, our customer metrics, I commented on, that's really the barometer. When you look at our gross and net PIs, when you look at customer churn, service increases and decrease and our net promoter score, I think those are all the measurements sort of right to the equal sign of how effective our program is. \nSabahat Khan: And then just one quick one, I guess, on the revenue guidance update there. I think just wanted to get a little bit more color on the softer roll-off portion. It sounds like bit of homebuilding and industrial slowdown. Is that just a change in the view of how the macro is going to evolve for the rest of the year based on what you've seen year-to-date? Or was there any specific issue that came up in the industry? Just want to get more color on the evolution of the view on the roll-off and the macro. \nJohn Morris: Yes. I think the takeaway here is we were guiding to about 1% volume and now we're probably down to about 0.5%. So it's a move but it's not that meaningful of a move. It's early in the year, too. I would tell you that when we were preparing for today, we're obviously looking at Q1, Q4. And we've seen a little bit of an uptick here in April. It looks like it's getting a tad better.\n I think the bigger news is aside from a little softness in the housing sector, which we spoke to, I think the rest of the business is still performing well. When you look at our post-collection volume, particularly MSW and our commercial volume still performing well, that's what really gives us conviction about the $100 million for the balance of the year that Devina commented on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan with Morgan Stanley. \nHilary Lee: This is Hilary Lee on for Toni. Congrats on the quarter, guys. Just want to touch on pricing a little bit. So when you said earlier that you expect price to hold for the rest of the year, does that mean you're expecting core price to be closer to around that 7% rather than the 6% you said last quarter? \nJames Fish: Well, we did say for price that -- and I mentioned it earlier that we actually exceeded a little bit of our expectations. So we're not changing anything for the year, but your point is well taken, that's -- that we actually ended up a little bit higher than the full year guidance and so that's a positive for us. At this point, we'll leave it where we originally set it, though. \nHilary Lee: Got it. And as a follow-up, just wanted to touch on the sustainability. I know last quarter, you talked about having about $150 million of EBITDA coming from the sustainability investments for 2024. Just wondering if you would be able to kind of give us a little bit of information on potentially the cadence or kind of the split between R&D and recycling. Any details would help. \nTara Hemmer: Sure. The $15 million increase that Devina referenced, the most significant portion of that is from recycling and really from commodity prices and not a whole lot of benefit from the renewable energy business. And the reason for that is we, today, have about 85% of our volume locked in, in either short, mid, or long-term offtake at this point, which is an increase from what we had said during our last call, which was roughly 2/3.\n So while RIN prices are increasing and we saw -- we've seen increased RIN prices, we've also seen some offsetting items on really natural gas prices and power prices related to a more mild winter that we had this year. \nDevina Rankin: And in terms of the cadence of when that shows up, it will be more heavily weighted toward Q3 and Q4 because our time line with regard to the incremental projects that are coming online is weighted toward the back half of the year. \nHilary Lee: Congrats again on the quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Hoffman with Stifel. \nMichael Hoffman: Devina, Jim, John, do we have a new baseline in margins? We can now say 29.5% to 30% is the new baseline and we'll grow from there? \nDevina Rankin: There's certainly nothing in the current year that tells us that this isn't the right baseline, so I do think that, that's a great way to look at it, Michael. Everything that you know about the WM culture is one that's focused on the customer and focused on continuous improvement. And I think those 2 things shone through and that commitment won't stop. So I do think the new baseline can go upward from here. \nMichael Hoffman: And then everybody, of course, is trying to figure out how they're supposed to model '25 already. But if we -- but you have to have some assumptions, so like what we think inflation is, what we think GDP is. If we said 3% inflation and 2.5% GDP, your price/cost spread on that number should still produce probably 30 basis points of margin. And then you still have everything John and Tara, that's a mouthful. This is my sixth earnings call in the last 7 hours, so it's running together. All that self-help still left, too. Is that the right way to think about, without putting the number on the increment, I start with 30% price/cost spread management, somewhere between 29.5% and 30%, add that 30% to it, and then I get self-help. \nDevina Rankin: I think that you've characterized it well in terms of self-help. I think it's that continuous improvement mindset as well as some of the things that were out of our control like truck deliveries. For a while, we've really moved past that headwind and are starting to see strong traction from getting the assets that we need to run our business. \nJames Fish: I look at it as continuous improvement, Michael. Self-help kind of sounds like I was an alcoholic and I'm coming off the bottle. \nMichael Hoffman: I didn't mean it pejoratively. I think of it as things that you can do, that you control as opposed to relying on the macro. \nJames Fish: I know. Just giving you a little bit of a hard time. \nMichael Hoffman: But what are you drinking these days? So cadence, Devina, in 4Q, you said first half, second half EBITDA growth should be about equal. Does anything change with the performance at this juncture? \nDevina Rankin: The only thing I would say is that first half solid waste growth is even greater than what we had projected because what you saw is the strong margin performance and growth from the solid waste business really showed up more quickly than we were expecting. So that solid waste lift comes more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. \nMichael Hoffman: So a little more weighting than slightly as opposed to evenly? \nDevina Rankin: Correct. \nMichael Hoffman: Okay. And on the $85 million of operational leverage, how much of that is the ITC benefit that runs through gross margin instead of through the tax line? \nDevina Rankin: None of it, zero. All of it's in the tax line. \nMichael Hoffman: Perfect. And then given the improvement in retention, I would assume the safety metrics are also at all-time goods? \nJohn Morris: Yes, that's a good point, Michael. I mean, take that sort of a leading indicator of what we can expect from safety. But there's a clear distinction between somebody who's tenured in the seat and somebody who's not. And that's not a critique of folks who are new in the seat. It's just a matter of having that experience. And we do see a pretty wide spread between those who are tenured in operating a vehicle and those who are not. So as we continue to hold that number down, we expect the safety results to continue to improve as well. \nJames Fish: By the way, Michael, the most -- we've said before, but the most important metric in this move from rear load to ASL is a safety metric. It's not a financial metric. Financials obviously are better, but it's a safety metric. And so as we continue to take a person from the back of the truck, which is the most dangerous place, honestly, in our entire operation, behind the truck, as we continue to move that person inside the cab, that will benefit us significantly. \nMichael Hoffman: Yes. And the last one for me. One of the powers of the roll-off business is that when it does slow, you park equipment, reposition drivers and raise prices. Is there anything different in this cycle? \nJohn Morris: No. Michael, I think you said it well. I mean, that's something we've been very focused on. Some of the technologies we've implemented over the last handful of quarters really starting to show benefits is really around capacity planning and making sure that we can see around the corner using, frankly, data and analytics that we didn't use a handful of years ago to be very predictive with a very small deviation between what history would tell us we need to plan from what we actually plan for, and we're still getting better at that. \nMichael Hoffman: So we might see a revenue hit for volume but you might not see much, if anything, in EBITDA because you make those adjustments so quickly. That's part of the point. \nJohn Morris: We talked about the volume being down for the quarter, Michael, but I think the revenue, it was off about $7 million. So when you look at the amount of volume versus what we got from a revenue quality standpoint, from a margin standpoint, from that perspective, it was a good trade-off. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. \nStephanie Benjamin Moore: I wanted to maybe circle back on the automation opportunity within residential, apologize if I've missed it, but where are we left in terms of automating some of those routes, automated side-arms and the like, what has been complete? What is left to do? And then I think you did mention the opportunity for greater automation on the commercial side as well. So maybe if you could just expand on that opportunity and the time line of starting to really kind of accelerate those efforts. \nJohn Morris: I did comment briefly on that. We've taken about 800 rear load trucks out of the fleet and about 650 rear load routes since we really started earnestly pursuing this in early Q2. We've got roughly another 350 to 400 routes we have targeted this year, and I say 350 to 400 because that has to do with some truck deliveries. And that probably -- when we get done in '24, that probably puts us in about the sixth inning, if you want to continue with the baseball analogy. We still got some room to go there. So hopefully, that clarifies that. \nJames Fish: And in commercial? \nJohn Morris: Commercial. I think on the commercial side, where we have -- continue to see benefit is really driving efficiency, and Jim commented on it. We've got some more sophisticated, frankly, tools to help us route our vehicles and, in some cases, the dynamic element is where we think -- although it's less in commercial than roll-off, there is a dynamic element to commercial and our ability to real-time route that. And to route around real-time traffic is another capability that we are just putting in, in the system now. \nStephanie Benjamin Moore: Got it. And then just to maybe touch on the labor aspect, so clearly seeing an incredible improvement in labor. You called out turnover. So I guess if we could kind of break out the components, clearly, turnover is at a significantly higher level. Are you seeing actual labor costs come down? Is this -- is the average employee being more productive because you're seeing more tenure? If you could just kind of maybe explain what we're seeing on the labor side or the fact -- is there a deflationary element of this as well? \nDevina Rankin: Yes, it's a great question. And I would tell you in terms of the inflationary cost pressure on wages, we have seen that soften. We're currently at about 5% wage inflation for our driver population, and that's certainly down from low double digits at its peak. So that's the labor component that's associated with inflation.\n The other piece is, John really talked about them, whether it's the route optimization work, efficiency, driver and technician retention, improved turnover. And then truck deliveries helps on that front, too, because ultimately, that is their office and they feel appreciated and like they have the assets that they need in order to serve the customer. And so we're seeing help in each of those aspects of the business.\n I think that the widening impact in terms of margin expansion from labor in the operating expense category is most significant on the efficiency front but certainly helps on the improved inflation headwind. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tobey Sommer with Truist. \nJack Wilson: This is Jack Wilson on for Tobey. Can you maybe speak to sort of the other benefits of the recycling facility upgrades other than sort of the potential to remove some positions? And is that capacity-based or is that some efficiency gains we'll be seeing? \nTara Hemmer: Sure. There's really 2 other components. The first is we really improved the quality of material that's generated so we're able to sell some of the material at higher price points. So really moving mixed paper into higher grades, and we get a price premium. That's been demonstrated in all of the automated MRFs that we brought online.\n And then also we're increasing the capacity at these facilities quite significantly, so we're able to bring in more volume. And that's going to be a great example of how we can tie that back to our customers and grow recycling volumes and also grow our collection volumes, too. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Kaye with Oppenheimer. \nNoah Kaye: So the really strong flow-through into free cash flow performance, can we just walk through how we get that improvement of $100 million? It sounds like, obviously, there's the operating performance, maybe also some tax items going on and then some working capital improvements. Just how do we think about the delta? \nDevina Rankin: Yes. So it really is an EBITDA story. And the EBITDA dollar growth that we are projecting of $100 million is expected to flow directly through. And the reason you don't have a tax offset there from the higher earnings is because we have $25 million of incremental expected ITCs. So those 2 kind of offset each other such that our outlook for cash taxes is effectively flat.\n So EBITDA is what drove our outlook for $100 million increase in free cash flow for the year. I would tell you, I do expect some upside from that potentially because we had such a strong quarter from a working capital perspective and certainly stronger than we expected. So in my experience, you have to wait to see whether that's timing-related, and so we didn't incorporate any working capital benefit in the revised guidance. \nNoah Kaye: That's really clear and helpful. And then a question that might not have a clear answer. But on PFAS, it seems like the EPA regulations kind of played out as expected, although pretty inequitable to have exemptions for municipal but not private solid waste it seems. I guess 2 things: one, can you talk about your expectations for cost impacts if everything kind of stands up the way it does as written today? And two, your thoughts on how that might potentially change, whether with congressional action or any further action on the part of EPA. \nJohn Morris: So Noah, I would tell you, we're obviously -- that's a topic we're following, I'm sure the whole industry is following very closely. There was some language in the last release from EPA that had some language about some protection for the landfill. But candidly, it didn't go far enough to give us a lot of security around the topic, so we're going to stay close to that. And as you can imagine, we're very vocal in all the right offices to make sure that we find a pragmatic approach to handling this because it is an issue that obviously has to be managed.\n I would tell you that landfills, both sub C and D are still considered to be very viable, long-term, responsible repositories for PFAS, so we still see it as an opportunity. The circle designation, which give us a little bit more latitude on the super fund side, actually, we see that as an opportunity for some of, in particular, DoD sites that are going to start getting cleaned up. We're already doing some of that work now.\n And then lastly, I would tell you on the cost side, a little hard to predict now. What I will say is very encouraging, though, when I was with our post-collection team in the last few days, there's a lot going on in the technology front that we think we can bolt on to our post-collection sites to be able to really effectively manage that at a cost that we can pass on to the customer. So hopefully, I captured it all. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tony Bancroft with Gabelli Funds. \nGeorge Bancroft: Congratulations, Jim, Devina, and John, the team on a great quarter. Just longer term, what are you -- is there -- are there any opportunities maybe through something transformational, either be it like these large regionals that are still around that everyone talks about or maybe something in a different line of business? What is your sort of longer-term outlook on the business and any interest in other -- maybe other opportunities? \nJames Fish: Yes. I think there certainly are always opportunities for us. Over the last couple of years, we've been focused on internal opportunities. We did say that with respect to M&A that we were sticking with our guidance that we've given in the last couple of years of $100 million to $200 million. But that there was some opportunity and the pipeline looked pretty strong. So I do think there's opportunity for us to grow both organically, as we've talked a lot on this call, but also inorganically, and we're just going to make sure it's the right acquisition that we feel like has a good strategic long-term prospect. \nOperator: I'm showing no further questions in the queue. I would now like to turn the call back over to Jim Fish for closing remarks. \nJames Fish: Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your participation, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Devina Rankin",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. Growing our adjusted operating EBITDA margin by 240 basis points in the first quarter stands out as the best indicator of WM's strong start to the year. As John discussed, the lion's share of this margin expansion came from the optimization of our operating performance in the collection business, with labor efficiency and improved repair and maintenance costs driving a 270 basis point improvement in our total company margin from the core. \n Our continued focus on managing our back office spending also contributed 20 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter, with SG&A as a percentage of revenue coming in at 9.5%. Commodity impacts in the quarter largely offset each other as fuel price impacts benefited margin by about 40 basis points, and recycling results decreased margin by about 30 basis points, primarily from the impact of higher recycled commodity pricing in the brokerage business. \n The remainder of the margin bridge from Q1 of 2023 to Q1 of 2024 relates to a headwind of about 60 basis points from the combined impacts of incentive compensation and costs incurred by our corporate team to drive adoption of our optimization programs. Our strong margin and earnings, combined with benefits from working capital and lower cash incentive compensation payments, led to robust growth in first quarter cash from operations. We're starting the year strong with cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue up over 500 basis points to 26.5%, demonstrating the value of our margin expansion to growing the company's cash flow yield. \n Capital expenditures totaled $668 million in the quarter, with both capital spending to support the base business and our investments in sustainability growth tracking as planned. Our first quarter free cash flow of $714 million allowed us to invest across all of our capital allocation priorities. We returned more than $550 million to shareholders, paying more than $300 million in dividends and repurchasing $250 million of our stock. In all of this, we still maintained our leverage ratio at our target levels of about 2.6x. With our strong balance sheet and robust earnings and cash flow outlook, we are well positioned to continue our commitment to shareholder returns and long-term growth. \n Our effective tax rate in the first quarter was 18.6%, which includes a $37 million benefit from investment tax credits related to the development of renewable natural gas projects. As we noted during our fourth quarter earnings call, our original expectation was that we would see a $120 million benefit in 2024 from the ITC. And we now expect $145 million for the full year. We expect this to benefit both our tax expense and free cash flow in 2024. \n As Jim mentioned, our great start to the year has put us on a higher growth trajectory for the full year than we initially anticipated when we gave guidance last quarter. We're confident that our full year operating EBITDA margin results can exceed the very strong 29.6% we achieved in the first quarter, and that is reflected in our increased outlook for 2024 operating EBITDA and margin. As we think about the balance of the year, we anticipate that outsized earnings and margin growth continues in the second and third quarters from our pricing programs and momentum in operating efficiencies that began late in the third quarter of 2023. We continue to expect that growth in our sustainability businesses will be more weighted to the back half of the year as more recycling and renewable natural gas projects begin operations. \n Pulling these points together, we want to emphasize that $85 million of the $100 million increase in our operating EBITDA guidance for the year is attributable to our team's strong execution on driving efficiency and the improved cost to serve in the collection business. The remaining $15 million is related to higher recycled commodity price expectations for the year. \n To wrap up, we're very pleased to deliver first quarter results that exceeded our own high expectations. Our sustained strong results are a testament to the investments we have made in talent, technology, and assets over the past several years. As always, I want to thank the entire WM team for their focus and dedication to delivering on our commitments to our customers, our communities, and our shareholders. \n With that, Towanda, let's open the line for questions. So I'll start with the easy one and confirm there were no accrual reversals or onetime items in the first quarter. The only kind of one-timer that we could point out is actually the loss of the Ian volumes from the prior year that would have been a hill to climb from a margin perspective because, as you know, storm volumes come at high margins. So in fact, the $212 million operating EBITDA growth in the collection and disposal business came with 310 basis points of margin expansion to 36.6% in the collection and disposal business. Yes, I think it's a great question. What I would tell you that we're looking at is a little softer climb from Q1 to Q2 in the normal sequential trends but still a marked improvement from Q1. And coming in, I would say, above 30% pretty handily in Q2 and Q3, in particular. We're currently expecting a little north of 30% in Q2 and potentially even north of 31% in Q3. Yes, great question. I would tell you in terms of the $85 million, it really is predominantly oriented to 2 things. And one, the biggest driver is our cost efficiency performance and the really strong execution on reducing cost to serve that John's talked so much about on labor and repair and maintenance. The other is the strong execution on price, and that's moderately ahead of the expectations that we had when we came into the year, and we think that will hold for the rest of 2024.\n With respect to fuel, it really didn't impact our dollar outlook for the business. What it did impact is our margin outlook for the business. And so the help in margin was 40 basis points in the quarter, and we think that some of that margin help continues into Q2 and Q3. With respect to how we executed in Q1 that gave us confidence in raising the margin outlook, I would tell you, we saw a really strong margin performance in the fourth quarter, really beginning in the third quarter of 2023 but again in Q4.\n And because Q4 and Q1, on a seasonally adjusted basis, tend to be lower volume and lower margin quarters for us, we really wanted to preserve some of the upside potential until we saw some of the normal seasonal upticks in our business in the second quarter. But with the strong performance in the first quarter, we really could not wait to reflect that we now expect a full year that will hit that 100 basis points of margin expansion. Great, thank you. So our original expectations for 2024 were $120 million, so our current outlook of $145 million is a $25 million increase of the ITC benefit in 2024 specifically. With regard to our full outlook for ITC capture over the development plan that we have outlined, we are tracking toward the high end of the original range of $250 million to $300 million. It's a great question. And while it's a little too early for us to be looking to specifically set guidance for '25, I do agree with you that there are some fundamentals that would make us a little more cautious to effectively repeating a 20 to 30 basis point margin expansion year-on-year. But that being said, I would tell you there are some fundamentals with respect to what we're seeing that we know have additional runway and growth, and those fundamentals really come on the labor and repair and maintenance side.\n So repair and maintenance, long term, has been below 9% of revenue. In Q1, we're at 9.5%. So 50 basis points of savings across the year is $100 million of EBITDA. So if we could see ourselves get there, I do think that, that's one of the things that could give us some incremental traction above that 20 to 30 basis points long term. The one thing that we don't really have clarity on yet, but we -- based on what we know today will be a headwind, is that the alternative fuel tax credits will expire at the end of 2024. And that's been about a $55 million benefit to our operating expenses on an annual basis. So that could be a headwind that would tamp down our margin for the years ahead. But we really do think there's strong traction in labor and repair and maintenance that will more than offset that headwind. And in terms of the cadence of when that shows up, it will be more heavily weighted toward Q3 and Q4 because our time line with regard to the incremental projects that are coming online is weighted toward the back half of the year. There's certainly nothing in the current year that tells us that this isn't the right baseline, so I do think that, that's a great way to look at it, Michael. Everything that you know about the WM culture is one that's focused on the customer and focused on continuous improvement. And I think those 2 things shone through and that commitment won't stop. So I do think the new baseline can go upward from here. I think that you've characterized it well in terms of self-help. I think it's that continuous improvement mindset as well as some of the things that were out of our control like truck deliveries. For a while, we've really moved past that headwind and are starting to see strong traction from getting the assets that we need to run our business. The only thing I would say is that first half solid waste growth is even greater than what we had projected because what you saw is the strong margin performance and growth from the solid waste business really showed up more quickly than we were expecting. So that solid waste lift comes more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Correct. None of it, zero. All of it's in the tax line. Yes, it's a great question. And I would tell you in terms of the inflationary cost pressure on wages, we have seen that soften. We're currently at about 5% wage inflation for our driver population, and that's certainly down from low double digits at its peak. So that's the labor component that's associated with inflation.\n The other piece is, John really talked about them, whether it's the route optimization work, efficiency, driver and technician retention, improved turnover. And then truck deliveries helps on that front, too, because ultimately, that is their office and they feel appreciated and like they have the assets that they need in order to serve the customer. And so we're seeing help in each of those aspects of the business.\n I think that the widening impact in terms of margin expansion from labor in the operating expense category is most significant on the efficiency front but certainly helps on the improved inflation headwind. Yes. So it really is an EBITDA story. And the EBITDA dollar growth that we are projecting of $100 million is expected to flow directly through. And the reason you don't have a tax offset there from the higher earnings is because we have $25 million of incremental expected ITCs. So those 2 kind of offset each other such that our outlook for cash taxes is effectively flat.\n So EBITDA is what drove our outlook for $100 million increase in free cash flow for the year. I would tell you, I do expect some upside from that potentially because we had such a strong quarter from a working capital perspective and certainly stronger than we expected. So in my experience, you have to wait to see whether that's timing-related, and so we didn't incorporate any working capital benefit in the revised guidance."

            "name": "John Morris",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning. In the first quarter, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 60.9%, continuing the positive trend of our disciplined management of operating costs, particularly in our collection business. Through strategic investments in innovative solutions and process optimization, we delivered improvements in operational efficiency, extracted costs, and setting a new standard for managing the middle of the P&L. Combining this strong operating expense performance with the disciplined pricing performance Jim described, we greatly enhanced overall operating EBITDA margins. In the first quarter, operating EBITDA in our collection and disposal business grew $212 million, and margin expanded 310 basis points to 36.6%. \n As we continue our journey of automation and optimization, we remain committed to harnessing the power of technology to drive sustainable growth, further reduce costs and improve profitability. In the first quarter of 2024, our continued adoption of technology and automation initiatives led to substantial reductions in both labor costs and repair and maintenance expenses. On the labor front, efficiency in all 3 of our collection lines of business improved meaningfully from the first quarter of 2023 as our implementation continues to gain traction. \n As an example, we're seeing nice improvements in performance from our routing efficiency program, next day optimization, or NDO, in our industrial line of business. This tool allows us to more dynamically route and it improves our efficiency, which is reducing our cost to serve and improving our asset planning. Currently, we have deployed NDO at 92% of our collection sites, and the majority of those are already achieving or exceeding efficiency targets. Additionally, we are achieving great results in the automation of our residential routes. Through Q1, we have automated over 650 routes and removed almost 800 rear load trucks since 2022. This has led to upwards of a 30% efficiency gain and residential EBITDA margins approaching 20%. \n The integration of these technology investments, coupled with the benefits of improved driver retention, have resulted in a 135 basis point improvement in labor costs as a percentage of revenue. In the first quarter of 2024, driver turnover improved to about 18%, down from over 22% a year ago. We expect ongoing benefits from continued moderation inflation as well as the investments we're making in our people and processes as we progress through the year. \n Turning to repair and maintenance. In the first quarter, repair and maintenance spending decreased year-over-year for the first time in several years, and spending as a percentage of revenue improved 50 basis points. In addition to our strong process discipline, we are also leveraging technology to reduce these costs. These technologies have enabled us to digitize much of our workflow, beginning with all of our technicians who now have portable technology in their hands. These tools facilitate our ability to assign and track work, drive technician efficiency, reduce downtime, and improve asset utilization. Our results are encouraging, and we see further runway to optimize repair and maintenance costs in the future. \n In addition to great operating cost performance, we continued to deliver top line growth primarily through disciplined execution on our pricing programs. Our customer lifetime value model continues to drive strong organic revenue growth, and our sales metrics in the quarter are a clear indication of our success in profitably growing the collection and disposal business. Churn was near the lowest rate that we've ever seen at 8.5%. New business improved 16% and continues to outpace lost business. Rollbacks remain in the low double digits. Net service increases remained positive, and our net promoter score improved by almost 12% year-over-year. \n Looking at revenue growth, as Jim said, we've seen a strong start to the year in pricing. Volume has been relatively consistent with our original expectations, with the exception of our temporary roll-off business. The softness in this volume category reflects some slowness in the homebuilding and industrial segments of the macro economy. C&D was also impacted with the lapping of volumes related to Hurricane Ian cleanup last year. With that said, our 2 bellwethers for demand, commercial collection and MSW volumes were positive in the quarter, and we also experienced  a nice uptick in special waste tons in the quarter. \n For the full year, we now expect total revenue growth of between 5% and 5.75%. The revision from our prior expectation is driven by 2 things: the softer temporary roll-off volumes mentioned; and a lower outlook for energy surcharge revenue, given the decline in the average diesel cost relative to our expectations. Our pricing remains on track, and in some lines of business, ahead of our original expectations. Our teams delivered outstanding performance in the first quarter, and I can't thank them enough for all their contributions to our success. \n I'll now turn the call over to Devina to discuss our first quarter financial results in further detail. Yes, a little more color, Tyler. I think a few things are occurring. One is, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a nice uptick in efficiency in all 3 lines of business from the mid-single digits up to the high single digits for residential. Residential is a really good story. If you look at the table in the back and you see we still traded about 2.9% of the volume down, but we made a good bit more money for the quarter. And I think we're starting to strike a better balance there. \n I mentioned in the prepared remarks, residential margins are approaching 20% at the EBITDA line. I think the M&R piece is certainly worthwhile on touching. Last year, we took delivery of about 1,450 trucks. We'll get about 1,800 this year, and that's having a meaningful impact. We felt like we've been chasing M&R costs and labor related to maintenance and repairs. \n And for us to actually tamp down costs quarter-over-quarter for the year is something, as I mentioned, we haven't done in a number of years. So I think it's been good efficiency, good cost discipline, our pricing remains robust, especially across the collection and disposal lines. So I think a lot of that came together in Q1. And as Devina mentioned, there really was no one-timer that benefited that. That was just strong execution by the team in the field. Yes. You're testing my memory here, Tyler. But I would say around 10%, 11% is what I recall. And I've said when we started down this journey, if you will, to really rationalize some of the residential business, we wanted residential to compete with commercial and industrial. And while we're not quite there yet, we can see a point where that gets a little bit closer to converging. And I think as that happens, that 2.5% to 3% volume that we've been kind of trading off on average will start to moderate as we get closer to that line. Well, I think the one line we can certainly look at, I think Devina had some of that in her prepared remarks, is kind of what the ratio is of direct labor to revenue. We saw a nice improvement there. I think that's a combination of 2 things: one, we've continued to be very disciplined about pricing. We've said we're playing the long game here, and I comment about customer lifetime value. So I think part of the benefit is we've continued to drive quality revenue at the top line across all the collection lines.\n And frankly, the post-collection line is worth noting it didn't come out, but this was our best quarter in history from a landfill pricing standpoint and a transfer station perspective. So the top line is strong. But I mentioned efficiency. And part of what's driving that mid to high single-digit efficiency is the use of technology to drive efficiency.\n Our turnover number's worth commenting on again because we are at all-time lows at about 18%. And that takes a lot of pressure off if you think about the cost, the friction cost of training folks, putting second people in trucks and all those things. So that's another part of it. And we're down about 750 routes year-over-year. And you can look at our volume. Part of it is being driven by the automation of residential. But the rest of it is we are less capital-intensive for basically doing more work in the commercial and industrial lines year-over-year. I would say, Jim, our customer metrics, I commented on, that's really the barometer. When you look at our gross and net PIs, when you look at customer churn, service increases and decrease and our net promoter score, I think those are all the measurements sort of right to the equal sign of how effective our program is. Yes. I think the takeaway here is we were guiding to about 1% volume and now we're probably down to about 0.5%. So it's a move but it's not that meaningful of a move. It's early in the year, too. I would tell you that when we were preparing for today, we're obviously looking at Q1, Q4. And we've seen a little bit of an uptick here in April. It looks like it's getting a tad better.\n I think the bigger news is aside from a little softness in the housing sector, which we spoke to, I think the rest of the business is still performing well. When you look at our post-collection volume, particularly MSW and our commercial volume still performing well, that's what really gives us conviction about the $100 million for the balance of the year that Devina commented on. Yes, that's a good point, Michael. I mean, take that sort of a leading indicator of what we can expect from safety. But there's a clear distinction between somebody who's tenured in the seat and somebody who's not. And that's not a critique of folks who are new in the seat. It's just a matter of having that experience. And we do see a pretty wide spread between those who are tenured in operating a vehicle and those who are not. So as we continue to hold that number down, we expect the safety results to continue to improve as well. No. Michael, I think you said it well. I mean, that's something we've been very focused on. Some of the technologies we've implemented over the last handful of quarters really starting to show benefits is really around capacity planning and making sure that we can see around the corner using, frankly, data and analytics that we didn't use a handful of years ago to be very predictive with a very small deviation between what history would tell us we need to plan from what we actually plan for, and we're still getting better at that. We talked about the volume being down for the quarter, Michael, but I think the revenue, it was off about $7 million. So when you look at the amount of volume versus what we got from a revenue quality standpoint, from a margin standpoint, from that perspective, it was a good trade-off. I did comment briefly on that. We've taken about 800 rear load trucks out of the fleet and about 650 rear load routes since we really started earnestly pursuing this in early Q2. We've got roughly another 350 to 400 routes we have targeted this year, and I say 350 to 400 because that has to do with some truck deliveries. And that probably -- when we get done in '24, that probably puts us in about the sixth inning, if you want to continue with the baseball analogy. We still got some room to go there. So hopefully, that clarifies that. Commercial. I think on the commercial side, where we have -- continue to see benefit is really driving efficiency, and Jim commented on it. We've got some more sophisticated, frankly, tools to help us route our vehicles and, in some cases, the dynamic element is where we think -- although it's less in commercial than roll-off, there is a dynamic element to commercial and our ability to real-time route that. And to route around real-time traffic is another capability that we are just putting in, in the system now. So Noah, I would tell you, we're obviously -- that's a topic we're following, I'm sure the whole industry is following very closely. There was some language in the last release from EPA that had some language about some protection for the landfill. But candidly, it didn't go far enough to give us a lot of security around the topic, so we're going to stay close to that. And as you can imagine, we're very vocal in all the right offices to make sure that we find a pragmatic approach to handling this because it is an issue that obviously has to be managed.\n I would tell you that landfills, both sub C and D are still considered to be very viable, long-term, responsible repositories for PFAS, so we still see it as an opportunity. The circle designation, which give us a little bit more latitude on the super fund side, actually, we see that as an opportunity for some of, in particular, DoD sites that are going to start getting cleaned up. We're already doing some of that work now.\n And then lastly, I would tell you on the cost side, a little hard to predict now. What I will say is very encouraging, though, when I was with our post-collection team in the last few days, there's a lot going on in the technology front that we think we can bolt on to our post-collection sites to be able to really effectively manage that at a cost that we can pass on to the customer. So hopefully, I captured it all."

            "content": "I can speak to that. So as we mentioned, we have 13 plants that we expect to bring online this year and another 13 next year, and those remain on track today. If you think about our exit in 2024 related to headcount, we'll be at a point where we've gotten 70% of the headcount out by the end of 2024 on the automation journey. So we should see not just a pickup from shutdown costs but also from the benefit of 30% improvement in labor costs and operating expenses from those plants. \n It's a great example of how we're able to bring to life in some of these communities. We were just up at Germantown last week for the grand opening celebration. And bringing in more capacity is a great way to differentiate WM in these key markets that we operate in. Exactly, seventh inning stretch. Sure. The $15 million increase that Devina referenced, the most significant portion of that is from recycling and really from commodity prices and not a whole lot of benefit from the renewable energy business. And the reason for that is we, today, have about 85% of our volume locked in, in either short, mid, or long-term offtake at this point, which is an increase from what we had said during our last call, which was roughly 2/3.\n So while RIN prices are increasing and we saw -- we've seen increased RIN prices, we've also seen some offsetting items on really natural gas prices and power prices related to a more mild winter that we had this year. Sure. There's really 2 other components. The first is we really improved the quality of material that's generated so we're able to sell some of the material at higher price points. So really moving mixed paper into higher grades, and we get a price premium. That's been demonstrated in all of the automated MRFs that we brought online.\n And then also we're increasing the capacity at these facilities quite significantly, so we're able to bring in more volume. And that's going to be a great example of how we can tie that back to our customers and grow recycling volumes and also grow our collection volumes, too."

            "content": "Hello, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to WM First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n I would now like to hand the conference over to Ed Egl, Senior Director of Investor Relations. You may begin. All right. Thanks, Ed, and thank you all for joining us. The WM team delivered another quarter of strong financial results to start 2024, powered by outstanding operational performance in the collection and disposal business. Total company operating EBITDA grew nearly 15% in the first quarter, and margin expanded 240 basis points, driven by substantial momentum on cost optimization efforts and disciplined execution on our pricing programs. \n Last quarter, we said the areas of strength in 2024 would look very similar to those of 2023, and that was definitely the case in Q1. Continued traction on cost optimization led to our third consecutive quarter of operating EBITDA margin above 29.5%, with Q1 coming in at 29.6% in the historically lowest margin quarter of the year. This margin result exceeded our expectations and reflects the tangible benefits of technology on our operating costs, the sustained effectiveness of our pricing strategy and the substantial progress we're delivering on our sustainability initiatives. \n It's our track record in these areas that gives us confidence we're positioned to deliver our highest-ever full year operating EBITDA margin between 29.7% and 30.2%, which is more than 100 basis points of expansion from 2023 at the midpoint. Our ability to convert more of each revenue dollar to earnings and free cash flow allows us to raise our prior outlook for both operating EBITDA and free cash flow by $100 million. \n As we progress through 2024, we're maintaining our focus on 3 priorities: disciplined pricing across each line of business, leveraging technology to permanently reduce our cost to serve our customers, and executing on our strategic investments in sustainability growth. John and Devina will cover more details on where we're seeing traction within the cost structure and where we have further runway, so I want to spend a few minutes on the other 2 priorities, our pricing strategy and the progress we're making in expanding our sustainability businesses. \n Beginning with pricing, we're pleased with the results we've seen from embracing a customer lifetime value model. Our teams are able to leverage customer-specific analysis to understand where a customer is on their journey and design actionable strategies that will extend the customer retention, improve profitability or both. We're confident that we found a winning approach to data-driven decision-making that optimizes price to reflect the value of the services we deliver, the strength of the asset network and our leading commitment to environmental sustainability. Our first quarter results again show that we have the ability to leverage price increases to cover costs and grow margin while also reducing customer churn. \n Shifting to our sustainability businesses. During the quarter, we delivered growth projects across the recycling and renewable energy businesses. This includes completing a large recycling upgrade in Germantown, Wisconsin. The updated facility relies on state-of-the-art equipment that reduces labor costs, increases throughput by 20%, up to 60 tons of material per hour, and improves product quality. We have another 9 upgraded facilities scheduled for completion this year, and we'll be opening 3 new recycling facilities and expanding our industry-leading single-stream network even further. \n Additionally, we've completed a new renewable natural gas facility this quarter at our DFW landfill in the Dallas-Fort Worth market, and we remain on track to commission another 4 new renewable natural gas facilities in 2024. We're also excited to announce that WM was just named the official sustainability partner of Major League Baseball. WM's work with MLB is the first collaboration of its kind between an environmental services company and a professional sports league team -- sports team league. With this partnership, we have the opportunity to offer services to all 30 MLB clubs in the United States and Canada. We expect to leverage our expertise to build comprehensive plans to improve the environmental impact of Major League Baseball and its clubs. \n In closing, I want to thank our WM team for all their hard work during the quarter. I'm immensely proud of their dedication and execution, which have helped achieve such strong financial results. And I'll now turn the call over to John to discuss our operational results. Tyler, I think part of that, I'm not sure it's that we're seeing any softening. It's just that we're kind of in uncharted territory here in terms of margin, I mean, which is a good thing, but to have a range that includes -- we've talked about numbers starting with a 3 for a long time, and now we finally have a number that starts with a 3 in our guidance range. So we're just being a little bit cautious about it. We certainly saw the trend that you just mentioned from Q1 to Q2 and on, but as did the field. But we feel like we're being maybe a little cautious as we get into some uncharted territory. I mean, I think the risk there, Devina, was as we discussed it, Bryan, the risk was, with such a strong performance, if we didn't raise guidance, there might have been questions on this call about, so is there something that we're not seeing that you're seeing? Is there something that you had that benefited you? And of course, Devina already answered that. The answer was no. But what we were a little concerned, if we didn't raise margin after such a huge margin performance that, by the way, was on the heels of 2 other quarters, that you might start asking questions about it, are we missing something? And you're not missing anything. We're just improving the margin that much. Jerry, I think there's some -- it's always going to be a combination of headwinds and tailwinds. Tara's here. She can talk about the fact that we have a bit of a tailwind next year when it comes to recycled shutdowns. I mean, this year, we're going to see somewhere in the neighborhood of $30 million, maybe a little less as an impact, a negative impact on us from shutting down these recycled plants while we rebuild them. That drops off pretty significantly next year. So you probably have somewhere in the neighborhood of a $25 million pickup or tailwind next year.\n The other thing that John and I and Devina have all talked a lot about is this kind of reduction in heads but doing it in a low-impact way, so it's just through attrition. And when we think about that, as I look at our actual headcount from '22, it's down over 2,000 people. And none of those people -- we're not -- none of those people were RIF-ed. We're not going through an arbitrary reduction in force. That's just choosing to not replace folks, and we've given about 4 or 5 different categories where that happens.\n But several of those categories are still not complete. One of them John has talked about, which is the shift from rear load to automated side load. Each time you do that, there is a person that is no longer needed on the back of the truck. As you can imagine, we have pretty high turnover there so we just take advantage of that through attrition. Similarly, in Tara's shop and the recycling business, as we rebuild these plants, we're seeing somewhere between a 30% and 40% reduction in labor costs, and so there are some related heads that come out with that.\n So we still, even in '24, have another probably, John, 1,200 total heads that will come out if you combine those 2 categories. And that takes us from 2,000 to 3,200, 3,300. So that's a big, big part of this is that we're doing this in a more labor efficient way, and it really is coming to fruition. So to use a baseball analogy since we just signed a deal with Major League Baseball, Tara, we'll be in the seventh inning? All right, perfect. John, you mentioned also, and John mentioned that in his script that 90% of the roll-off line of business has been rolled out on this [ India ], which is the term for our optimization model. But we haven't rolled out commercial and haven't rolled out residential on that model yet, so we still have a fair amount of room to go there. And all of this is -- it was really 4, 5 years ago, an admission by us, that our routing was not as efficient as it could be if we used -- truly used technology to benefit that. I think that's probably the case across the entire industry. And so 4 or 5 years ago, we decided that, that had to change and now you're seeing the fruits of that. I think we -- look, there's always room for improvement so I would not tell you that we're -- that we've perfected this. But from when I was a price guy back in the early 2000s, it's night and day. I think the team has done a spectacular job using data and analytics to their benefit and making sure that we are looking at the customer who really drives the decision as opposed to driving the decision just purely based on a number that we needed to hit in our price metrics. So I would tell you that we've made a ton of progress there. Are we perfect? We're not, but so much better than we used to be. Well, we did say for price that -- and I mentioned it earlier that we actually exceeded a little bit of our expectations. So we're not changing anything for the year, but your point is well taken, that's -- that we actually ended up a little bit higher than the full year guidance and so that's a positive for us. At this point, we'll leave it where we originally set it, though. I look at it as continuous improvement, Michael. Self-help kind of sounds like I was an alcoholic and I'm coming off the bottle. I know. Just giving you a little bit of a hard time. By the way, Michael, the most -- we've said before, but the most important metric in this move from rear load to ASL is a safety metric. It's not a financial metric. Financials obviously are better, but it's a safety metric. And so as we continue to take a person from the back of the truck, which is the most dangerous place, honestly, in our entire operation, behind the truck, as we continue to move that person inside the cab, that will benefit us significantly. And in commercial? Yes. I think there certainly are always opportunities for us. Over the last couple of years, we've been focused on internal opportunities. We did say that with respect to M&A that we were sticking with our guidance that we've given in the last couple of years of $100 million to $200 million. But that there was some opportunity and the pipeline looked pretty strong. So I do think there's opportunity for us to grow both organically, as we've talked a lot on this call, but also inorganically, and we're just going to make sure it's the right acquisition that we feel like has a good strategic long-term prospect. Okay. Well, thank you all for joining us today. We appreciate your participation, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter."
