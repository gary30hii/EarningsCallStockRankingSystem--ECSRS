During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.\nBill Slater: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\nJim Foote: Thanks, Bill, and thank you to everyone listening in today. I want to begin by recognizing all of CSX's employees for continually responding to the challenges of 2020. Our results are a testament to our amazing people and the strength of our company. The core principles instilled over the last few years allowed us to act decisively with coordinated effort and alignment across the company. Over the course of the year, we reexamined every process from the ground up to identify and eliminate unnecessary steps across the railroad. And as a result, uncovered significant opportunities to build upon the progress made during our transformation. These changes will provide benefits for years to come. Now, let's turn to Slide 5 of the presentation and our fourth quarter financial results. Operating income grew 5% to $1.2 billion and the operating ratio improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 57%. Our reported earnings per share were $0.99, but I want to point out that this figure includes a $0.05 per share charge related to the early retirement of debt. For the full-year, despite lower overall economic activity and historic demand volatility, CSX produced a full-year operating ratio of 58.8%, exceeding our initial guidance of a 59% operating ratio. Moving to Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue declined 2% on 4% higher volumes as intermodal revenue growth was more than offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and declines in coal. Merchandise revenue and volume were flat as revenue growth in chemicals, ag and food, metals and equipment, and fertilizers was offset by declines in other markets and lower fuel surcharges. Intermodal revenue grew 6% on a 11% higher volumes to new quarterly record levels. This performance was driven by a combination of strong demand for transportation services due to inventory replenishments and volume growth from East Coast Works. Coal revenue was down 18% and 9% lower volumes as the coal business continues to be negatively impacted by lower domestic utility demand, industrial production and global benchmark prices. Other revenue was down 6% as increased intermodal storage revenue was more than offer by a higher reserve for freight and transit and lower demurrage charges. Turning to Slide 7, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a new quarterly record low number of personal injuries and full-year record lows for both personal injuries and train accidents. While our efforts to build a culture of safety can be seen in the annual performance trends, we can always be better. We have launched new near miss and workplace hazard reporting programs that encourage employees to report potential safety concerns. We are also working to increase awareness of incidents and trends by conducting joint terminal tours with CSX management and local labor representatives. This proactive approach to reporting and communications, it's helping drive increased employee engagement as we identify and eliminate unsafe practices across the railroad. Turning to Slide 8. We have previously discussed how the use of autonomous car and track inspection technologies is helping us meet our safety goals, and we will continue to invest in new programs to improve safety. However, we have a much broader vision and the increased use of technology in our business. Technology is foundational to our growth. We are actively investing in new technologies across the railroad, but a barely scratching the surface of what is possible. We are making our intermodal yard smarter and more autonomous. We are piloting programs that will further fuel efficiency, such as allowing us to optimize speed across the full trip of a train. And in the field, we're getting rid of paper-based processes and converting to digital ones that allow faster communications that are data capture, it improves safety compliance. As we look to the future, we are upgrading our dispatch system to lay the groundwork for enhanced network performance, through dynamic real-time routing decisions. We see opportunities to implement predictive analytics in our maintenance programs to both reduce mechanical failures and more systematically identify areas of track most in need of investment. Additionally, beyond these significant operating benefits, we are investing to improve our customer experience and create easier and more streamlined processes for our customers to do business with CSX. Every action we take is designed to make CSX smarter, faster and more reliable. Turning to Slide 9. We remain committed to sustainably managing our own business, as well as helping our customers reduce their emissions. In 2020, customer shipping with CSX avoided more than 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. To put this into context, this figure is roughly equivalent to the emissions produced powering all the buildings in New York City for almost a full-year. We remain focused on furthering these environmental benefits, not only by continuing to improve the efficiency of our own operations, but also by providing a reliable alternative to trucking that allows our customers to meet their emissions goals without having to sacrifice the reliability of their supply chain. We have set ambitious long-term goals in order to remain leaders in sustainability. And we are committed to expanding the benefits rail offers as the most sustainable mode of land-based transportation. Let's turn to Slide 10 and look at our operating performance for the quarter. Clearly, the simultaneous rapid increase in both volumes and COVID-related employee absences impacted the network, but overall, the railroad is running well and we were still able to drive incremental efficiencies. Locomotive productivity achieved a new quarterly record for GTMs for available horsepower and we set a new fourth quarter record for fuel efficiency, a 0.94 gallons per thousand gross ton miles. On Slide 11, our improved efficiency is further illustrated, which compares volumes and asset levels against the pre-COVID and prior year periods. As volumes return, our revised operating plan is aligning us to operate at a sustainably higher level of asset utilization. This is reflected both in the sequential trends, where volumes have increased at twice the rate of asset redeployment, as well as double-digit productivity gains we have maintained between year over year volume and asset levels in the second-half. While our team did an excellent job of working during this period to make the network more efficient, our number one priority remains providing our customers a high-quality service product. There is still significant leverage built into the operating plan. But as volumes grow, we have been and will continue to add crews and locomotives as needed to serve our customers well. Turning to Slide 12, our carload trip plan performance was 75% for the quarter and intermodal trip plan was 84%. Like all transportation and logistics companies, we have faced challenges from both the rising number of COVID cases along with broader supply chain disruptions from volatile demand, inventory shortages and imbalanced freight flows. This team has done an admiral job navigating this environment. But we expect these trip plan figures will return to and then exceed our results from the beginning of 2020. While our performance is still at industry leading levels, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. I'll now turn it over to Kevin for a review of the finances.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. After a challenging year, we are all excited to turn the page to 2021. That said we accomplished a lot this past year, which sets us up well, as the economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic. While many markets remain challenged, we did see an improving business environment in the fourth quarter and as a result delivered both volume and operating income growth for the first time in 2020. We manage costs through the year and made sustainable improvements to the train plan which will drive operating leverage as volumes return. We once again delivered a quarterly record operating ratio. Excluding real estate gains, this marked the third quarterly record in 2020, an extraordinary accomplishment by this entire team. This past year, we focused on what we could control. Navigating the uncertain and volatile business environment, while successfully driving efficiencies across the business. Our goal in 2021 and beyond is to leverage the growth ahead of us, by sustaining these efficiency gains and driving further improvement across the business. Looking at the fourth quarter income statement. Revenue was down 2% as continued volume growth and pricing gains in our intermodal business were offset by the ongoing effects of weak coal demand and lower fuel recovery. Merchandise revenue was in line with the fourth quarter of 2019, but we have seen positive momentum as revenue improved 5% sequentially and from the third quarter, above normal seasonality. Total expenses were down 7% in the quarter on a 4% increase in volume, walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was 11% lower, reflecting the benefit of the train plan optimization and an 8% reduction in total headcount. Throughout 2020, our operating team continued to refine the train plan in response to the dynamic volume environment. These improvements enabled significant efficiency in the fourth quarter, as crew starts were down 11% and while overall volumes were up 4%. Lower crew starts in the quarter also translated to fewer active trains and, as a result, reduced the need for locomotives. The smaller fleet drove a 14% reduction in our locomotive labor expense. We were also able to hold the line on the significant reductions made earlier in the year to our engineering contract labor expense, as well as our intermodal terminal workforce, even as volumes continue to increase sequentially. Lifts per man-hour, a key measure of efficiency for our intermodal workforce improved 23% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Moving forward, we are preparing for growth. The current environment remains challenging and unpredictable with COVID related mark offs, significantly impacting pockets of our network. We wish the best for these employees and hope for their speedy recovery. Moving forward, we will hopefully begin to see improvement from current levels. We continue to focus on crew availability and are currently accelerating our first half hiring efforts to be prepared in the event of stronger demand. We expect headcount will likely exceed attrition in the first half of the year to provide flexibility, should demand surprise positively, particularly in the second half. We will manage it closely and adjust accordingly, as we monitor the trajectory of the potential volume recovery. MS&O expense increased 4% or $19 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the $20 million headwind from real estate gains, MS&O expense would have been roughly flat, as efficiency and volume-related savings were offset by inflation and other items. The improvements to our train plan, I mentioned before, also drove savings, including lower crew travel and repositioning costs, as well as lower locomotive materials and contracted service expense. Real estate gains were minimal in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2020, we continue to manage a pipeline of future properties that we will monetize when conditions are favorable. Our base case is for real estate sales activity to be roughly flat. As I've said before, we will also continue to pursue opportunities to leverage our real estate to generate recurring revenue streams. Fuel expense was $77 million favorable, a 36% improvement year-over-year, driven by a 33% decrease in the per gallon price and record fourth quarter fuel efficiency. We continue to invest in technologies that will drive further improvement in fuel efficiency, widening the advantage over truck and demonstrating our continued commitment to sustainability. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $3 million or 1% in the quarter. This reflects a larger asset base as well as the impact of a road and track depreciation study. Depreciation expense is expected to be a $10 million to $20 million headwind in 2021. Equipment rents expense increased $4 million or 5%, as higher days per load across all markets resulted in increased freight car rents. Turning below the line. Interest expense was flat, as higher net debt balances were offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Other income decreased $48 million, reflecting a make-whole charge related to the early redemption of $500 million of long-term notes that were set to mature in 2023. Income tax expense increased $24 million or 11%, due to higher pre-tax income, as well as the cycling of certain state and federal tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019. Closing out the income statement. CSX delivered operating income of $1. 2 billion, reflecting a fourth quarter record 57% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 15. On a full year basis, capital investment was relatively flat even during the pandemic, we remain committed to investments that prioritize the safety and reliability of our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure. This commitment will not change. And by level loading the maintenance spend, we are improving the safety and fluidity of our network without requiring a step-up in core infrastructure spend going forward. Capital allocation remains a focus. And we have a healthy pipeline of high return investments, we expect to invest in this year. In 2020, free cash flow before dividends was $2. 6 billion, down versus 2019, primarily reflecting lower operating income but also impacted by lower proceeds from property sales. Free cash flow generation remains a key focus of this team. Even during 2020's challenging environment, free cash flow conversion, while net income was about 95%. We expect to stay above 90%, even with slightly higher CapEx and an increase in expected cash tax rate. Our cash and short-term investment balance remains strong, ending the quarter at $3.1 billion. Our expectation remains that this balance will normalize over time as we continue to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJim Foote: Great. Thanks a lot Kevin. Concluding with Slide 17, we expect to return to growth in 2021 for both CSX and the U.S. economy. While much debate remains around the pace of this growth as we've transitioned from COVID headwinds to potential stimulus fuel tailwinds, we believe CSX is well-positioned to grow volumes faster than the prevailing GDP growth rate in 2021. Merchandise volumes should outpace industrial production growth as we convert additional truck volumes off the highway and onto CSX. We expect intermodal volumes to grow even faster than merchandise as the business continues to benefit from the ongoing inventory restocking and a tight truck market. And following an extremely challenging year, we expect the coal business to begin recovering from 2020 trough levels. As volumes increase, we will drive incremental operating leverage by efficiently absorbing the additional cars and containers into our revised train plan. We still have significant opportunity to add volumes onto the existing trains and we'll have train starts as needed to maintain high levels of customer service. We project full year CapEx of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. This spend reflects ongoing investments in our core infrastructure, combined with several high-return growth investments for technology and sales and marketing initiatives. We will continue to evaluate attractive growth investment opportunities as they arise. But from a network perspective, we still have ample line of road and terminal capacity. Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. We will repurchase shares through our ongoing buyback program and we will look to be opportunistic with share repurchases as we utilize our roughly $6 billion of buyback authority. The actions taken in 2020 have positioned CSX for success and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared to handle the expected growth in 2021. This past year has proved that although we have accomplished great things during our transformation, our team is still finding opportunities to push this company to new heights. I enter this year as excited as I have ever been for what the future holds for CSX. Thank you and I'll now turn it back to Bill for questions. As you may have noted at the beginning of the call, Mark Wallace is unfortunately not joining us today as he's dealing with a non-COVID personal health issue. The rest of the team will do its best to answer any marketing questions you may have.\nBill Slater: Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now conduct our question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. Well, Jim, I guess maybe we can start there, unfortunate for Mark, he's not here, but you guys do sound like you have some confidence that merchandise, I think you've said, will grow in excess of industrial production and intermodal even better than your merchandise outcomes. So, I guess, are there any specific examples you can give us where you're winning in the network and delivering this new service product that we've heard about for a couple of years? Now how's that translating into confidence this year?\nJim Foote: Well, in many respects, the conversion of trucks up the highway back onto the rail system has been -- we've talked about it for many years where it's our existing customers today, where we're doing a lot of work with them already in their boxcar fleet. And so we know them very well, but we've never really had an opportunity to take a look at their book of business from what they're doing on the other -- on the doors on the other side of the plant, so to speak, where they're sending it out in truck. And now that our service product has become more reliable, we've been able to capture more and more that wallet share. And that applies whether it's in force products, whether it's in pulp board, whether it's in metals, whether it's in chemicals, you name it, we've been able to do that. And I think that's clearly the strategy that we will continue to pursue, along with looking at ways through our transflow opportunities, where we can reach customers' business that before we didn't have the capability to handle because we didn't focus on kind of the last-mile business if we didn't directly connect to a customer's location. So it's a combination of different factors that spread out really across the entire spectrum of merchandise, and again principally because our service now is as reliable as a truck. And we - obviously, maybe it's the easy way, but let's go to our customers that we already know and do business with and shake the tree there. And there is a ton of opportunity for us. And again, similarly, in our intermodal franchise, where we're getting more businesses, we're looking at lanes that before we couldn't compete in because we had somewhat of a disjointed network, and we've worked hard to rationalize and improve the service on the network and that's bringing us additional business. So we've been building on this for a number of years, and we expect it to continue to pay benefits in 2021.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon. Jim, maybe you could just talk a bit about the missed business opportunity, given COVID. Kevin kind of threw out some thoughts that there was missed opportunity. Can you quantify your thoughts looking back and maybe what that means as how fast you bring employees back into 2021?\nJim Foote: In terms of missed opportunities, we have \u2013 we, CSX are no different than anybody else in the country. And our employees have been impacted by the virus to the same degree as everyone else, if not more, in the transportation sector, because they're essential workers and they're out there on the frontline in and out every single day, making sure the goods get across the country and we can take care of people that are -- have the luxury to sit home and ride this thing out. So if we've missed any opportunities, it's been as the surge of traffic came back in the third quarter, just about the time the virus began to tick up. And then clearly, it took off with the Thanksgiving holiday. So we're aware of that. We're prepared for that. And maybe we've missed something along the way. I think what Kevin was more and more concerned was and Kevin is not be able to express his opinions on this. We think that based upon all the work we've done for the company to make sure that we can grow this business. And with the potential for a rebound in the economy and with the potential for maybe stimulus and with the potential for maybe additional transportation spend by the government, we don't want to miss out on something if it comes along, we want to be ready to handle it. So we're planning, we're preparing. We're making sure -- clearly, we have track capacity. Clearly, we have assets in terms of locomotives, et cetera. What we want to make sure is, we have the employees. And this is not like we can go hire some guy off the street and put them to work the next day. It takes five, six months to train these people to get them ready. So we're aware of the curve that we want to make sure that we're managing to the curve. And so, I think that's what Kevin was referring to, in any missed opportunity, was to make sure that we're prepared to handle growth when it comes.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. \nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, I guess, with the dynamic of intermodal growth outpacing merchandise growth this year, do you think yields can be up in 2021 versus 2020? And then if you can just also talk about the magnitude of OR improvement? How should we think about OR improvement, given the benefits of higher volume, but then obviously, some of the adverse mix that comes with the intermodal outpacing merchandise?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think, as I mentioned last quarter, we had the greatest contribution from our Intermodal business, which has traditionally been viewed as a least profitable segment of our business. But yes, we put up a record OR. I think we again proved that in the fourth quarter. You saw the intermodal business, obviously, having the strongest growth. And again, we were able to deliver record OR performance As we go into 2021 as with any year, there's normal inflation costs that you have to offset and overcome as you want to improve your margins going into next year. We have labor inflation a little bit higher than what we saw in 2020. We have health and welfare costs ticking up a little bit more than what we saw last year. But really inflation, when I look over the long-term average, it's probably a little bit under that long-term average, so not a huge significant headwind. But really, the variable here is going to be the growth. I'm very confident if growth exceeds our expectations that we'll drop that through at a very attractive incremental margin. Our goal here is to be prepared for the growth to grow operating income. That's really the goal of what we're talking about around here. It's exciting to talk about and prepare for growth. And so that's what we're looking at. I mentioned in the first-half of the year, we'll accelerate our hiring to make sure we're prepared for whatever environment comes in the second-half. And Jamie will quickly adjust accordingly if things change on us, which as we know, this has been a dynamic environment and we just want to be ahead of the curve and be prepared for it and be able to deliver. I think we all say, shame on us, if we can't deliver the growth when it comes. And so that's what we're talking about here internally.\nAmit Mehrotra: Could you just answer the yield question in terms of whether you think yields will be up year-over-year in 2021?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think when you look at the first half of the year, we'll have some fuel surcharge. Fuel will still be a headwind really in the first quarter, will start -- that will start to moderate as you get in the second quarter. So, second half of the year, you'll see a little bit less fuel surcharge headwind. Coal in the first half of the year, probably on a yield basis, will be a little bit of a headwind. Obviously, that market\u2019s pretty dynamic, particularly on the export side. But see some support going in the second half of the year. So, I would say, definitely expect second half to be improved over first half, but that always goes back to mix as well as we see some of our higher RPU business, whether it's chemicals or other areas, see continued strength, that certainly helps the dynamic there. But the coal dynamic should moderate first half of the year and really not be as much of a headwind going forward.\nAmit Mehrotra : Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good afternoon and great job on the quarter. Without specifically focusing on where the OR can go in 2021. I sort of wanted to ask a longer-term question. I mean, it sort of seems feasible to do a 55 OR this year. But, I mean, it just seems like you guys are pushing the boundaries of what we thought might have been either remotely possible for an Eastern rail. So I would just love to hear your thoughts on how you view the potential for the longer-term profitability of the business. I mean, obviously, you guys are gaining share. And Jim, you highlighted a number of efficiencies that will come in the future from technology investments. So any thought there? And then just sort of lastly, Jim, if you could sort of tell us what you think about the difference between a long-haul and a short-haul railroad as it comes down to, it's a long-term profitability and if there are truly already any structural differences? Thank you.\nJim Foote: Great, Allison. Good one question. So, a couple -- three years ago, it was just only a couple of three years ago when we were in New York talking about how we were going to take this wore out, beat up, run down railroad and have a 60% operating ratio in a couple of three years, and everybody said, you guys are crazy, can't be done. And now I think you said you want double nickels here win next year. We're trying to grow operating income and earnings per share, so that we can reward our shareholders and not just get singularly focused on these operating ratio. So the operating ratio pretty much will be what it is. Obviously, you saw what we can do when we get our hands dirty and we get focused on what needs to be done in order to run the company better. I truly believe, as Jamie and his team get in collaboration with Mark and the sales and marketing team, collaborate on how we need to get this company running more -- even much, much, much more reliably and faster in the future in order to provide a better quality product to our customers. The necessary result, the ultimate result of all of that is that we take a lot of crazy unnecessary activities out of the system that we do today, and that drives down the cost. So without focusing on a specific reduction in the operating ratio, I firmly believe that we will continue to drive efficiency, but as we \u2013 and we'll do that as we focus on \u2013 and we'll focus \u2013 as we focused on driving \u2013 building a better product for our customers. In terms of in terms of short-haul railroads with \u2013 versus long-haul railroads with \u2013 in the operating ratio. Again, every railroad is slightly different. Every railroad has its nuances. Used to \u2013 we used to have some really, really, really nice long-haul routes across Western Canada back in the day when I used to work there. And it was very nice to ride along and take a look at the moose and some greenfields and a little bit of this, a little bit of that, go for a couple of thousand miles. But there weren't any customers. Here, we're like winding around and maybe got a little shorter haul, a little more challenges. And in \u2013 we're stopping all the time because we've got customers all over the place. So they come \u2013 it comes with what it is. This is \u2013 there's a lot of business activity in the east that we have the opportunity here to take advantage of. And that's a good thing. And another part of my history goes back to my days at the Chicago Northwestern when we built the line into the Powder River Basin coal fields subsidiary called Western Railroad properties, which is about 200 miles long, hit an operating ratio that started with a four handle. So every piece of \u2013 every railroad property is different. Every railroad property is unique. Our goal is to have the best quality product and do it in the most efficient way. And if we do those two things, the thing that happens is we make a lot of money doing it.\nAllison Landry: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could give a sense about -- I think, Kevin, you said you're going to add headcount above the pace of attrition. I know there's a lead time to have T&Y, get them recruited and get them trained up and on the system. So I would assume you have pretty good visibility to what that number is. If you look at the next quarter or two and wanted to see if you could give us a sense is that sequentially 1% increase or 3%, or just kind of magnitude? Is it a big step up, or is it something that's pretty gradual and is that something we should think about in terms of our margin modeling in first half of the year, or is it just kind of small, so it doesn't really affect how you do with incrementals or margins?\nKevin Boone: No. This is \u2013 and maybe I'll hand it over to Jamie to talk a little bit about his strategy and what he's really planning for here. But no, these aren't in order of magnitude, huge step-up in our hiring process. A lot of it to get ahead of the attrition rates that we see coming ahead in 2021. And really, I think we're pretty confident that, again, we're going to have the operating leverage that we've continued to deliver. So I wouldn't expect headcount to go up more than the volumes that we're going to see and the revenue increases, and we'll adjust the model accordingly as I think we have more visibility, hopefully, going forward on where volumes are trending. We've seen a lot of volatility in every market out there. And hopefully, the volatility starts to diminish here a bit as we move to the second half of the year. Jamie?\nJim Foote: Yes, thanks. Look, if I was to look at percentages, when you think about it, our attrition rate is somewhere around 8% per year, so what we want to do is kind of front-load that attrition rate, keep a good eye on our discussions with Mark and his team to make sure we're ahead of that business that might be coming our way as we progress through the year, which then allows us to backfill the rest of that attrition towards the back end of the year. If the business doesn't come, we'll be in a situation where we can at least attrit out to the end of the year and go from there. So, as Jim said, it takes four to six months to make a conductor. So, we don't get ahead of this now and the business comes along, we're going to be leaving it on the ground, and that's the last thing we want to do.\nTom Wadewitz: So, the headcount increases sequentially early in the year. And then if the business is in there, the attrition could kick in and it could fall back off. Is that essentially what you're saying?\nJim Foote: Absolutely. That's how we're setting it up.\nTom Wadewitz: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. Wanted to ask about comp for employee. Kevin, any color you can provide on what you're expecting there over the course of 2021? And then maybe for Jamie, I was wondering if we could get an update on the number of locomotives in storage today and what you're anticipating for that utilization rate going forward?\nKevin Boone: Yes, I'll take the comp per employee. Look, as I talked about in my opening remarks, we're going to see a little bit of more labor inflation this year. We'll see the management increase take effect here, January 1, which is a little bit different than what we've seen in previous years. So, that will be effective in the first quarter. But overall, I think historically, we talked about this 3% increase and without knowing what really incentive comp can move around quarter-to-quarter. All those things, I think a 3% kind of range is a good starting point.\nJim Foote: And look, on the asset side, in particular, locomotives, we started this back in 2017 with almost 4,000 locomotives, our fleets down $21.50, I think, today, right around that area. So, we've got hundreds of locomotives still in storage ready to pull out when needed. But we're also continuing to invest in our locomotive fleet. I mean our CapEx coming up this year. We're going to continue to rebuild locomotives. We've got 67 in the plan this year, and continuing to do that as we go forward. It's really important that we continue to invest in the assets that we have. And that allows us to put trip optimizer, distributed power, fuel savings, as well as reliability. So, we're comfortable with the assets that we have now. We just want to continue to invest in rebuilding what we have going forward.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks afternoon guys. So, Kevin, any color you can give us on M S&O costs that you expect for the year? I know it's volatile, but any color there? And then on the OR, I know we're not getting guidance, but almost always the full year OR is better than fourth quarter. Is there anything wrong with that line of thinking right now?\nKevin Boone: The first quarter, better than the fourth quarter.\nScott Group: No. Meaning, if you look at a full year, it's almost always better than the fourth quarter you just had. And the fourth quarter\u2026\nKevin Boone: Yeah. Again, I think we gave relative revenue guidance because there is a little bit of uncertainty, I think, as you get into the second half, hopefully, some of these initiatives that Jim talked about will take hold and we'll see the economy strengthened through the back half of the year. I think we're real comfortable just saying that we're pretty confident in the incremental margins that we've been able to deliver, and we'll continue to do that, particularly if we get stronger revenue growth than we expect there. So that's the opportunity. On the MS&O, when you look at the fourth quarter, really, we're able to deliver what we thought we're going to do when we guided in the third quarter. Real estate sales going into 2021 will be flat, so not a real big factor or driver on those costs on a year-over-year basis. We do expect inflation to hit us in 2021 there. But again, it's an area where we have a lot of focus, and we'll continue to try to find opportunities to take out costs. So I think expect some normal inflation impact to that line item, but nothing real impactful there moving into 2021. It will move also with volume. So if volume is a little bit higher than what we expect. You would see some variable costs move up with that as well.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Yeah, hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, one last question about service. We think about the second half of the year, obviously, service was a little bit more challenge still quite good, but down from where you were in the first half of the year, and when you think about sort of headcount and maybe resources. Is there a level, I guess, number one, on the service, or a level where you feel like you're comfortable or maybe you need to address it to move the needle-moving back up? And then second, when you think about maybe a little bit of the front-load from a headcount perspective, does that have an impact on the service, or would you expect that to have an impact on the services as you move into the first half of the year?\nJim Foote: Yeah. Let me just make a general comment and then Jamie can answer you into details about where we are in terms of headcount. I think the railroads are not unique in the second half of the year. This phenomena with everyone trying to keep up with this unprecedented volume is creating issues whether it be in foreign ports, whether it be in ocean vessels, whether it be in the West Coast ports, the East Coast ports, the railroads, the trucks, logistics service providers, you name it. Everybody is dealing with a situation where volumes are unprecedented and volatile. At the same time, when we have hundreds, literally hundreds of employees are sick or in quarantine. In one day, it's on the west side of the railroad. The next day, it's on the east side of the rail. The next say, it's in the north side of the rail, next day it\u2019s in Florida. And so for us to be doing the job from a service standpoint right now, I don't think anybody is saying, they're having problems because the railroads are screwed up. We're doing a really, really, really good job of managing our way through this. And I'll let Jamie talk in some more detail about what it is we're doing.\nJamie Foote:  I think, Jim, really nailed it with respect to some of the pockets we're seeing and why some of the levels aren't where they were historically. But you really look at some of the stuff that we have gained though as well. When you look at \u2013 to a 19% all-time record train length increase year-over-year, the fuel efficiency, everything else that we've been able to keep and maintain and continue to move forward as we talk about 2021. I can tell you today, as we see -- Jim said, hundreds and hundreds of employees are off, that's correct. And as we start to see 100 employees less, let's say, today than we were a few weeks ago, yes we're starting to feel that we're getting even more fluid. So as those numbers come down, we feel like we have the right number of people out there, if we -- if everyone returned to work. Now I wish, I could predict where the next pocket was going to be and try to send people that way, but it's difficult to do that. So yes, we're going to hit some bumps and bruises, I think, over the next quarter or so. On some of our service levels, but we are pushing. And is there a limit where we're happy? No, absolutely not. We've got -- if anyone wants to ask the question, is there anything left? What else are you going to continue to do, it's normally a question we get asked. Well, our dwell and velocity isn't where it needs to be. That's an opportunity. So as we continue to maintain all the hard work that we've done with the new plan, and the team that I've got out there working hard day in and day out on dwell and velocity and what's going on in the terminals, we're going to get that much better. And as business comes back and as we do some hiring, it helps us move the new commodities that we have come online. But really, what we have today is just a matter of dealing with the pockets that are out there. I can tell you, it is a daily exercise in trying to understand how some terminals we work around 40% of our employees being off on COVID. It doesn't just normally hit a small percentage. We do have it across the property. But we have some pockets where 40% of our employees are gone for a period of time. We've got a great team that moves into there, helps out. We work ourselves through it. We work around it, which is great about the network we have as we can do that, and continue to move the product. Look, we will see our numbers continue to improve as we move forward. But again, it's -- sometimes it's a daily exercise depending on where we're having our COVID issues.\nScott Group: Got it. Thanks for the color guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: Yes, good afternoon. Kevin, you talked about your excess cash balance and looking to normalize it overtime, is that something you're targeting for this year or could that be more gradual? Just any thoughts on how you want to manage your liquidity and balance sheet with the cash flow you expect to generate this year would be helpful? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think, look, I would expect something lower by the time we exit this year. So yes, I think that's probably a this year event. We'll watch it closely here. Certainly, as we get more comfortable with the trajectory of the economy and those things, we'll have those discussions internally here on what makes sense. We always want to be opportunistic. So we'll be there opportunistically in the stock as well. So it gives us a lot of flexibility. We're going to generate a lot of cash this year as well. So it's a good position to be in. It's a position of strength. And we'll do the best we can.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good evening. Thanks for taking the question. Jamie, maybe I'll take you up on the dwell and velocity one. They have deteriorated for while here. Obviously, volumes have been quite volatile. They have longer trains to help offset that challenge. It doesn't seem to be a headwind financially now, but we've also seen cars online come up quite a bit. So maybe you can dig in a little bit deeper and give us a sense as to what has been the challenge outside of labor and what you see sort of the opportunities, maybe a time frame as to seeing some improvement. And then, Jimmy, if you can comment on the growth opportunities you're seeing for the truck conversion side. That doesn't sound like any of the service challenges now or in recent quarters are really affecting anything, but maybe if you can just clarify that for us as well, if the customers are just needing capacity and you have it, and it's really just tough out there for everybody.\nJamie Boychuk: Okay. I'll try to take a stab at -- you're hard to hear, but let me try to work down with respect to where we're sitting with some of our metrics. So, yes, our dwell and our velocity definitely has been impacted here over the past couple -- probably, a couple of months, but we've seen probably more of a deterioration really over the past month, if you take a look at some of our numbers. And again, a lot of that's COVID related. But for us, it's really important to show that as an opportunity as well. As we continue to move things faster and we get our dwell to where we know it can be and will be. Those are costs that are going to continue to come out as we look at our plan. Cars online, our target, we're a little bit above where our target -- where we really want it to be. But you got to think, when we started this back in 2017, we were over 150,000 cars online. Now, we're somewhere around 100,000, maybe 120,000 depending on where you're looking at it. We have done some things differently on that. There was a time, I would say, a year ago where we were shooting for a 90% fill rate, because we didn't necessarily understand whether the fill rate was correct? Whether the customers were ordering and not ordering. Mark and his team have done an unbelievable job working with us to understand that, that fill rate now, pushing it to 100%, gives us that extra business that Jim has been talking about, about knocking on our customers' doors to say, hey, why are you trucking when you got rail service, give it to us and allow us that reliability. That means at some point, you're going to have to bring on some cars online, as you take a look at fulfilling 100% fill rate. So that's what we're pushing towards in our model. We're comfortable with that. We're keeping a good eye on what those cars look like as they move around. And if anything, the opportunity, as we look at the car fleet we have, now as we start picking up that velocity, we're going to get more loads out of those cars that are out there, which is more opportunity for us to be able to spin the customer cars. Some of the highest numbers that we have year-over-year are private cars. So that's an opportunity there for customers to spin their cars faster and give us four or five more loads a year as we get quicker. So, yes, it's opportunity, opportunity, opportunity as we move forward with the plan that we put in.\nJim Foote: Yes. And by doing all those things correctly in a coordinated fashion between operations and sales and marketing, that's what's driving this business from the highway onto the rail.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Jamie, I was wondering if you could kind of help us understand that rate of resource addition in relation to volume growth. I think you guys are laying out a picture that says somewhere in the mid-single digits on volume. And I'm not asking you to confirm that as a volume guide. I'm just trying to get a sense for, if we're going to be at that level of volume growth, what level of resource do you need to add into the network from today's levels to kind of keep pace with that at the service level you want to provide?\nJamie Boychuk: Look, when we talk about hard assets with respect to locomotives, we're in a good spot. We're going to need to use some more locomotives as some volume starts to come back. Yes. When you look at bulk business, definitely, those are per train starts. When you look at our car fleet, I'm comfortable that as our dwell continues to come down as we move forward, we'll need less boxcars. But we're going to make sure that we hit that fulfillment rate of 100%, right? That's a 10% difference when you really think about 90% was a target a year-or-so ago. Now it's 100% as we move forward with our customers, showing the reliability of being there with the car supply we say we're going to be. Yes, you're going to see a bit of an increase. But where we're at right now is a good spot. As we move faster, as I mentioned, we'll get that many more loads out of the cars that are out there, which is going to help that growth as we continue to move forward. And I think we've really touched on the people side of things. Front-loading is the right thing to do. It gives us that four to six months to do that hiring practice and deal with the attrition that we see out there and prepare us for what's going to happen towards the second half.\nJim Foote: Yes, David, the hiring is really offsetting the attrition that we expect through the full year. But really front-end loading that so we can get ahead of it and react to any volume upside that could occur in the second half.\nDavid Vernon: Yes. I'm just trying to point, do we need to be at this 2019 to \u2013 can we \u2013 could we accommodate a 5% volume growth with the current headcount level, or does it need to be a little bit higher than that? And what's the proportion of which the headcount would need to be added back?\nKevin Boone: Well, I think a lot of this, I think, is going to give us the ability to hit the hot pockets where we were low on crews right now and it's really redistributing Jamie, correct me if I'm wrong, \u2013 redistributing a lot of the employees to where we were going to need and where we see the growth coming.\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. It's based off of \u2013 obviously, we look at our attrition rate and where it's at and where we expect those employees to attrit out. But this is working very close with the marketing team. This is very \u2013 as Jim mentioned earlier, the closer that Mark and myself and our teams work together, we know and have an idea where this business growth is going to come from. Could it throw us a curveball? Sure, it could. But you want to \u2013 as it stands right now, we're preparing in those areas that we need to, and we're going to make sure that we hire in those \u2013 to make sure we can capture that growth. And look at cars online, really, when you look at year-over-year, the percentage is 12%. But really, we're down 4% full year versus prior full year. So we're not talking about a big percentage points here. And it's really important that we give the reliability of getting that box card to 100% fulfillment, if we want those customers convert over.\nDavid Vernon: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good evening everyone. Thanks for confirming the view on coal improving from the 2020 trough levels. I wanted to get your views on how much of that is anticipation of the domestic market versus the export market? And as it relates to the latter, we're seeing shortages in certain regions of the world because of the bitter winter weather and some trade issues. Have you seen any uptick in your export coal opportunities given some of those issues?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think when you look at our coal business; fourth quarter was -- showed a little bit of strength versus previous three. So, we're exiting the year at a little bit better position than what we saw, call it, the middle of the year here. Going into next year, probably the strength that we anticipate will really be on the domestic side with a little bit of the utility stockpiles below normal levels. So, we see some opportunity there. You see the same benchmark prices on the export side that we see. They stabilize, which is a good sign. They're still well below the levels that we saw pre-pandemic, whether that's an opportunity from here, we hope so. I think the risk/reward is probably a little bit more balanced than it has been in previous years or particularly coming into 2020. So, you're probably referencing the China, Australia, spat they have on the coal side right now, not helping the global prices right now and so not really helping us. So, hopefully, that gets resolved, and we'll see some maybe net price upside here going forward, but that's a very difficult market for us to predict. On the thermal side, if you look at our business today in the fourth quarter, really, that export business is 75% med and 25% thermal. If you get some of these polar vortex impacting some of the global markets and get a cold wave here. Maybe that's an opportunity because we're delivering very little to Europe and other areas today. So, we're going into the year cautiously optimistic. I don't see a huge upside case, but see a little bit of stability and strength off of the fourth quarter.\nJon Chappell: Sounds great. Thanks Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes hi. Just one quick question. To the extent you have it, do you have the -- your economic thoughts that sort of underpin the commentary you made on volume, in other words, volumes greater than GDP, merchandise greater than industrial production. What's your economic guys saying around those two measures?\nKevin Boone: Well, as I said, there's -- there are a lot of different views on what the underlying number is going to be. And so right now, we're not -- we're trying to find what is the most reliable number for us to look at. And also at the same time, as you know, everybody is adjusting their numbers and to a large degree, from -- they're adjusting them down. So, our guys don't necessarily have -- our guys have a -- I'm sure they have -- they have an independent view, but it's not something that we're going to put out there as what we think right now is something that we're willing to bet the pharma, and so to speak, and how we're going to run the company. We're trying to look at all the different viewpoints and as we move further into 2021, hopefully, things get clearer and clearer for us as we progress.\nJordan Alliger: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Hey, gentlemen, my best to Mark, hope he feels better. I wanted to talk a little bit about your trip plan compliance. It looks like things are going in the right direction on the carload side. Talk a little bit about what you guys are doing there to improve that? And then is there really anything that the railroad can do right now to materially move the intermodal trip plan compliance, or is this all just, sort of, congestion needs to work through some of the ports and some of the inland facilities?\nJim Foote: Let me start with the look at the trip plans on the intermodal side. Look, we have -- we considered probably on both ends, the most stringent trip plans out there with respect to always making sure that we measure both loads and empties, whether that's intermodal or on the merchandise side. And I'd like to say our times are probably some of the most stringent times out there where, on the intermodal side, you're arriving to the minute. Over the past couple of months or a month or so, UPS peak was amazing. It was a big, big quarter. I don't think that's a surprise. And as we felt some pressure at different ports in different areas, we got the opportunity to move even more UPS traffic than we expected to. So some of our international traffic may have -- that isn't as time-sensitive, may have taken a little longer to get off the port than we normally would to make sure we move the time sensitive traffic. But going forward, I fully look at our numbers with respect to the intermodal side, 90% above is where we should be getting. I mean, we're shooting for above 95% on that, and I'm confident that our team is there. And we're starting to see some of those numbers hit already as we've moved past some of that UPS peak. On the carload side, again, you missed by two hours on the carload side, that's it. It's failed, whether it's a loader or empty, and our connections are tight from terminal to terminal. And if you have some of those COVID pockets, we're 40% of your terminals off, and it takes you an extra six or eight or 10 hours to get a car to a terminal, that\u2019s a failure. We're not willing to change our standards and our metrics with respect to where they sit to getting to that last mile. So we're going to work through this, which we have. We've seen some improvement on the numbers. Not as quick as I would like to see some of those continue to move forward. But we do have the best metrics with respect to those who look at trip plans out there today. So we're confident that moving forward, we're going to see that number get up into the 80s. And our target will continue to be to push forward with that, which will allow that reliability for Mark and his team to go up there and continue to sell this product that we've built.\nJason Seidl: That's great color, and I'm glad to hear things are moving in the right direction on the numbers, and everyone be safe out there. Appreciate the time as always.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. So just to, kind of, wind up here, the -- am I expecting a bit of a tone shift from the OR here. I think over time, you guys have, kind of, clearly mentioned that you are going to be pursuing growth to a great extent going forward. But kind of as we think of that 3 to 5 year or algorithm going forward, again, you're starting to sound a little bit more like the Canadian rails who are saying, hey, we're going to -- OR is not the only thing as a standalone, we're going to be looking at growth and growing EBIT dollars here. So are you targeting sticking to a high 50s OR, but pushing the top line much higher from here?\nJamie Foote: Well, we -- again, we've never said that we are singularly focused on one thing only, and that's trying to get the operating ratio down. And just in simplistic terms, if you want at a 50 operating ratio, we'd have a 50 operating ratio. We do it like quickly. I'm not sure what would be left to the company in the process.  But \u2013 so it's always a balance between trying to do things as efficiently as you possibly can. While you're delivering a good product to the customer, so you can grow the business. And that's always from day one, since I walked in the door here being the plan. And it just takes a while to get the railroad to run right because you can start to be able to generate some new business. So the algorithm going forward is the algorithm that we've had in place for the last 3 going on 4 years, focused on delivering a really high-quality, good, reliable product to the customer, which allows you to get more business. And if you do that, you drive a whole bunch of unnecessary costs out of the company and you increase efficiency. When you do that, you make a lot of money and you make a lot of money, shareholders are happy. That's our simple business plan.\nRavi Shanker: Great. And maybe as a quick follow-up. We have a new administration this morning. Are there any kind of 2 or 3 things you're looking for from DC something you're watching out for either as a tailwind or a headwind?\nJamie Foote: Government stability that too much to ask for. I would be \u2013 that would be a good start. So let's give them a couple of weeks to figure out whether or not we're going to have debt, and then we can start figuring out, if there's any significant real change in anybody's agenda. We're used to working with not only on the federal level. But we operate in 22, 23 states. Some of them are led by a Democratic Governor and some are led by a Republican Governor. So we're used to dealing with all kinds of philosophies in viewpoints as it relates to government relations with business. And so, it's not new to us. We'll just figure out what to do and how to interact, and then we'll get along fine with everybody.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nWalter Spracklin: Well, thanks so much. Hi, good evening. Just to follow-up on that question with regards to Washington. And looking back, a swing in favor, swing of power in favor of the Democrat has not been a good thing from a railroad regulatory standpoint. And now that your ORs are trending where they are, Jim, do you see any risk that regulators start to put close attention on the returns you're getting now and introduce new risk of changes or more leniency or favoritism towards the customer here?\nJamie Foote: No, not necessarily. I mean, again, there's a mix -- there's a remix. There's a mix on the STB that goes back and forth in terms of whether it's -- now, I guess it's two-three versus what it was before, maybe two-three, versus maybe what it was at one point in time. So, again, this is something we're always dealing with. We're not unique in the sense that we're a regulated -- or we have a regulator. And so, it's not like every airline railroad, telephone company, TV company, you name it, anybody that's got a regulator, all of a sudden is worried about the end of days. We just adapt, and we figure out what it is their concerns are. And we work appropriately with them. And we've been doing this for a couple of hundred years and doing it successfully.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. Understood. And if I could, just a clarification question for Kevin here. On the question of yield, I know you answered that kind of on a segmented basis. If I lump it all together, am I right in interpreting what you said, that yield is going to be negative in the early part of the year and possibly turn positive in the back half. Is that the right way to look at yield? Because it's been so negative this year, it will obviously have a pretty big impact, depending on which direction we go on the magnitude of the yield here.\nKevin Boone: Yes. Like I said, the revenue -- or the fuel surcharge will be a headwind in the first quarter. That will weigh on the yield similarly to what we saw in the fourth quarter here. That will moderate in the second quarter and then I think you'll see some improvement. I always have to caveat it with mix matters, right? And depending on what markets, hopefully, the strong markets, like our chemical business and others, continue to have some upside, and that will obviously be a huge impact to our yield performance. If the coal export market strengthens, as you know, our contracts are structured to participate in the commodity prices, if they strengthen. So that would be also an opportunity for us into the back half of the year. Offsetting that, I think, we are still very bullish on, as you heard us talk about on the intermodal side, it's a really good business for us. It happens to have a lower RPU, but we make good money there. And so we would -- Jamie is ready to handle more growth there, and we have a great team going after more opportunities. So, although, it's equal, where we see it today, which will change probably tomorrow. Yes, a little bit of headwind in the first quarter, probably strengthening into the back half of the year.\nWalter Spracklin : Okay. Appreciate the time. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ross from Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Ross: Thank you. Love the enthusiasm, operator. Kevin, I wanted to follow-up on your last comment there about intermodal, specifically related to intermodal pricing. Is the expectation for better than normal intermodal pricing, given what's going on in the truckload market, or is it going to be more of a cost recovery, low single-digit type yield improvement story?\nKevin Boone: Well, we don't see real-time -- some of our partners see in terms of price. We'll generally see a lag there. There's also inflation adjusters that occur, they want a lag basis as well. So, again, it kind of fits with my commentary around probably second half, hopefully showing some improvement over the first half. Unfortunately, in strong markets, we don't get to reprice our entire book of business. Today, these things happen over time. We'll need the markets to remain strong and supportive. And so that yes, I think we're somewhat optimistic, but there's a lot of \u2013 time will tell. What happens going forward, if the economy can strengthen in the back half of the year that certainly will help the discussions our sales and marketing team are having. So they're out there selling the business hard right now.\nDavid Ross: Good. Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session and concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call.

            "name": "Jamie Boychuk",
            "content": "Okay. I'll try to take a stab at -- you're hard to hear, but let me try to work down with respect to where we're sitting with some of our metrics. So, yes, our dwell and our velocity definitely has been impacted here over the past couple -- probably, a couple of months, but we've seen probably more of a deterioration really over the past month, if you take a look at some of our numbers. And again, a lot of that's COVID related. But for us, it's really important to show that as an opportunity as well. As we continue to move things faster and we get our dwell to where we know it can be and will be. Those are costs that are going to continue to come out as we look at our plan. Cars online, our target, we're a little bit above where our target -- where we really want it to be. But you got to think, when we started this back in 2017, we were over 150,000 cars online. Now, we're somewhere around 100,000, maybe 120,000 depending on where you're looking at it. We have done some things differently on that.

So, yes, it's opportunity, opportunity, opportunity as we move forward with the plan that we put in. Look, when we talk about hard assets with respect to locomotives, we're in a good spot. We're going to need to use some more locomotives as some volume starts to come back. Yes. When you look at bulk business, definitely, those are per train starts. When you look at our car fleet, I'm comfortable that as our dwell continues to come down as we move forward, we'll need less boxcars. But we're going to make sure that we hit that fulfillment rate of 100%, right? That's a 10% difference when you really think about 90% was a target a year-or-so ago. Now it's 100% as we move forward with our customers, showing the reliability of being there with the car supply we say we're going to be. Yes, you're going to see a bit of an increase. But where we're at right now is a good spot. As we move faster, as I mentioned, we'll get that many more loads out of the cars that are out there, which is going to help that growth as we continue to move forward. And I think we've really touched on the people side of things. Front-loading is the right thing to do. It gives us that four to six months to do that hiring practice and deal with the attrition that we see out there and prepare us for what's going to happen towards the second half. Yes. It's based off of \u2013 obviously, we look at our attrition rate and where it's at and where we expect those employees to attrit out. But this is working very close with the marketing team. This is very \u2013 as Jim mentioned earlier, the closer that Mark and myself and our teams work together, we know and have an idea where this business growth is going to come from. Could it throw us a curveball? Sure, it could. But you want to \u2013 as it stands right now, we're preparing in those areas that we need to, and we're going to make sure that we hire in those \u2013 to make sure we can capture that growth. And look at cars online, really, when you look at year-over-year, the percentage is 12%. But really, we're down 4% full year versus prior full year. So we're not talking about a big percentage points here. And it's really important that we give the reliability of getting that box card to 100% fulfillment, if we want those customers convert over."

            "name": "Jim Foote",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you to everyone listening in today. I want to begin by recognizing all of CSX's employees for continually responding to the challenges of 2020. Our results are a testament to our amazing people and the strength of our company. The core principles instilled over the last few years allowed us to act decisively with coordinated effort and alignment across the company. Over the course of the year, we reexamined every process from the ground up to identify and eliminate unnecessary steps across the railroad. And as a result, uncovered significant opportunities to build upon the progress made during our transformation. These changes will provide benefits for years to come. Now, let's turn to Slide 5 of the presentation and our fourth quarter financial results. Operating income grew 5% to $1.2 billion and the operating ratio improved 300 basis points to a new fourth quarter record of 57%. Our reported earnings per share were $0.99, but I want to point out that this figure includes a $0.05 per share charge related to the early retirement of debt. For the full-year, despite lower overall economic activity and historic demand volatility, CSX produced a full-year operating ratio of 58.8%, exceeding our initial guidance of a 59% operating ratio. Moving to Slide 6. Fourth quarter revenue declined 2% on 4% higher volumes as intermodal revenue growth was more than offset by lower fuel surcharge revenue and declines in coal. Merchandise revenue and volume were flat as revenue growth in chemicals, ag and food, metals and equipment, and fertilizers was offset by declines in other markets and lower fuel surcharges. Intermodal revenue grew 6% on a 11% higher volumes to new quarterly record levels. This performance was driven by a combination of strong demand for transportation services due to inventory replenishments and volume growth from East Coast Works. Coal revenue was down 18% and 9% lower volumes as the coal business continues to be negatively impacted by lower domestic utility demand, industrial production and global benchmark prices. Other revenue was down 6% as increased intermodal storage revenue was more than offer by a higher reserve for freight and transit and lower demurrage charges. Turning to Slide 7, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the fourth quarter, we achieved a new quarterly record low number of personal injuries and full-year record lows for both personal injuries and train accidents. While our efforts to build a culture of safety can be seen in the annual performance trends, we can always be better. We have launched new near miss and workplace hazard reporting programs that encourage employees to report potential safety concerns. We are also working to increase awareness of incidents and trends by conducting joint terminal tours with CSX management and local labor representatives. This proactive approach to reporting and communications, it's helping drive increased employee engagement as we identify and eliminate unsafe practices across the railroad. Turning to Slide 8. We have previously discussed how the use of autonomous car and track inspection technologies is helping us meet our safety goals, and we will continue to invest in new programs to improve safety. However, we have a much broader vision and the increased use of technology in our business. Technology is foundational to our growth. We are actively investing in new technologies across the railroad, but a barely scratching the surface of what is possible. We are making our intermodal yard smarter and more autonomous. We are piloting programs that will further fuel efficiency, such as allowing us to optimize speed across the full trip of a train. And in the field, we're getting rid of paper-based processes and converting to digital ones that allow faster communications that are data capture, it improves safety compliance. As we look to the future, we are upgrading our dispatch system to lay the groundwork for enhanced network performance, through dynamic real-time routing decisions. We see opportunities to implement predictive analytics in our maintenance programs to both reduce mechanical failures and more systematically identify areas of track most in need of investment. Additionally, beyond these significant operating benefits, we are investing to improve our customer experience and create easier and more streamlined processes for our customers to do business with CSX. Every action we take is designed to make CSX smarter, faster and more reliable. Turning to Slide 9. We remain committed to sustainably managing our own business, as well as helping our customers reduce their emissions. In 2020, customer shipping with CSX avoided more than 10 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. To put this into context, this figure is roughly equivalent to the emissions produced powering all the buildings in New York City for almost a full-year. We remain focused on furthering these environmental benefits, not only by continuing to improve the efficiency of our own operations, but also by providing a reliable alternative to trucking that allows our customers to meet their emissions goals without having to sacrifice the reliability of their supply chain. We have set ambitious long-term goals in order to remain leaders in sustainability. And we are committed to expanding the benefits rail offers as the most sustainable mode of land-based transportation. Let's turn to Slide 10 and look at our operating performance for the quarter. Clearly, the simultaneous rapid increase in both volumes and COVID-related employee absences impacted the network, but overall, the railroad is running well and we were still able to drive incremental efficiencies. Locomotive productivity achieved a new quarterly record for GTMs for available horsepower and we set a new fourth quarter record for fuel efficiency, a 0.94 gallons per thousand gross ton miles. On Slide 11, our improved efficiency is further illustrated, which compares volumes and asset levels against the pre-COVID and prior year periods. As volumes return, our revised operating plan is aligning us to operate at a sustainably higher level of asset utilization. This is reflected both in the sequential trends, where volumes have increased at twice the rate of asset redeployment, as well as double-digit productivity gains we have maintained between year over year volume and asset levels in the second-half. While our team did an excellent job of working during this period to make the network more efficient, our number one priority remains providing our customers a high-quality service product. There is still significant leverage built into the operating plan. But as volumes grow, we have been and will continue to add crews and locomotives as needed to serve our customers well. Turning to Slide 12, our carload trip plan performance was 75% for the quarter and intermodal trip plan was 84%. Like all transportation and logistics companies, we have faced challenges from both the rising number of COVID cases along with broader supply chain disruptions from volatile demand, inventory shortages and imbalanced freight flows. This team has done an admiral job navigating this environment. But we expect these trip plan figures will return to and then exceed our results from the beginning of 2020. While our performance is still at industry leading levels, we hold ourselves to a higher standard. I'll now turn it over to Kevin for a review of the finances. Great. Thanks a lot Kevin. Concluding with Slide 17, we expect to return to growth in 2021 for both CSX and the U.S. economy. While much debate remains around the pace of this growth as we've transitioned from COVID headwinds to potential stimulus fuel tailwinds, we believe CSX is well-positioned to grow volumes faster than the prevailing GDP growth rate in 2021. Merchandise volumes should outpace industrial production growth as we convert additional truck volumes off the highway and onto CSX. We expect intermodal volumes to grow even faster than merchandise as the business continues to benefit from the ongoing inventory restocking and a tight truck market. And following an extremely challenging year, we expect the coal business to begin recovering from 2020 trough levels. As volumes increase, we will drive incremental operating leverage by efficiently absorbing the additional cars and containers into our revised train plan. We still have significant opportunity to add volumes onto the existing trains and we'll have train starts as needed to maintain high levels of customer service. We project full year CapEx of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. This spend reflects ongoing investments in our core infrastructure, combined with several high-return growth investments for technology and sales and marketing initiatives. We will continue to evaluate attractive growth investment opportunities as they arise. But from a network perspective, we still have ample line of road and terminal capacity. Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. We will repurchase shares through our ongoing buyback program and we will look to be opportunistic with share repurchases as we utilize our roughly $6 billion of buyback authority. The actions taken in 2020 have positioned CSX for success and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure that we are prepared to handle the expected growth in 2021. This past year has proved that although we have accomplished great things during our transformation, our team is still finding opportunities to push this company to new heights. I enter this year as excited as I have ever been for what the future holds for CSX. Thank you and I'll now turn it back to Bill for questions. As you may have noted at the beginning of the call, Mark Wallace is unfortunately not joining us today as he's dealing with a non-COVID personal health issue. The rest of the team will do its best to answer any marketing questions you may have. Well, in many respects, the conversion of trucks up the highway back onto the rail system has been -- we've talked about it for many years where it's our existing customers today, where we're doing a lot of work with them already in their boxcar fleet. And so we know them very well, but we've never really had an opportunity to take a look at their book of business from what they're doing on the other -- on the doors on the other side of the plant, so to speak, where they're sending it out in truck. And now that our service product has become more reliable, we've been able to capture more and more that wallet share. And that applies whether it's in force products, whether it's in pulp board, whether it's in metals, whether it's in chemicals, you name it, we've been able to do that. And I think that's clearly the strategy that we will continue to pursue, along with looking at ways through our transflow opportunities, where we can reach customers' business that before we didn't have the capability to handle because we didn't focus on kind of the last-mile business if we didn't directly connect to a customer's location. So it's a combination of different factors that spread out really across the entire spectrum of merchandise, and again principally because our service now is as reliable as a truck. And we - obviously, maybe it's the easy way, but let's go to our customers that we already know and do business with and shake the tree there. And there is a ton of opportunity for us. And again, similarly, in our intermodal franchise, where we're getting more businesses, we're looking at lanes that before we couldn't compete in because we had somewhat of a disjointed network, and we've worked hard to rationalize and improve the service on the network and that's bringing us additional business. So we've been building on this for a number of years, and we expect it to continue to pay benefits in 2021. In terms of missed opportunities, we have \u2013 we, CSX are no different than anybody else in the country. And our employees have been impacted by the virus to the same degree as everyone else, if not more, in the transportation sector, because they're essential workers and they're out there on the frontline in and out every single day, making sure the goods get across the country and we can take care of people that are -- have the luxury to sit home and ride this thing out. So if we've missed any opportunities, it's been as the surge of traffic came back in the third quarter, just about the time the virus began to tick up. And then clearly, it took off with the Thanksgiving holiday. So we're aware of that. We're prepared for that. And maybe we've missed something along the way. I think what Kevin was more and more concerned was and Kevin is not be able to express his opinions on this. We think that based upon all the work we've done for the company to make sure that we can grow this business. And with the potential for a rebound in the economy and with the potential for maybe stimulus and with the potential for maybe additional transportation spend by the government, we don't want to miss out on something if it comes along, we want to be ready to handle it. So we're planning, we're preparing. We're making sure -- clearly, we have track capacity. Clearly, we have assets in terms of locomotives, et cetera. What we want to make sure is, we have the employees. And this is not like we can go hire some guy off the street and put them to work the next day. It takes five, six months to train these people to get them ready. So we're aware of the curve that we want to make sure that we're managing to the curve. And so, I think that's what Kevin was referring to, in any missed opportunity, was to make sure that we're prepared to handle growth when it comes. Great, Allison. Good one question. So, a couple -- three years ago, it was just only a couple of three years ago when we were in New York talking about how we were going to take this wore out, beat up, run down railroad and have a 60% operating ratio in a couple of three years, and everybody said, you guys are crazy, can't be done. And now I think you said you want double nickels here win next year. We're trying to grow operating income and earnings per share, so that we can reward our shareholders and not just get singularly focused on these operating ratio. So the operating ratio pretty much will be what it is. Obviously, you saw what we can do when we get our hands dirty and we get focused on what needs to be done in order to run the company better. I truly believe, as Jamie and his team get in collaboration with Mark and the sales and marketing team, collaborate on how we need to get this company running more -- even much, much, much more reliably and faster in the future in order to provide a better quality product to our customers. The necessary result, the ultimate result of all of that is that we take a lot of crazy unnecessary activities out of the system that we do today, and that drives down the cost. So without focusing on a specific reduction in the operating ratio, I firmly believe that we will continue to drive efficiency, but as we \u2013 and we'll do that as we focus on \u2013 and we'll focus \u2013 as we focused on driving \u2013 building a better product for our customers. In terms of in terms of short-haul railroads with \u2013 versus long-haul railroads with \u2013 in the operating ratio. Again, every railroad is slightly different. Every railroad has its nuances. Used to \u2013 we used to have some really, really, really nice long-haul routes across Western Canada back in the day when I used to work there. And it was very nice to ride along and take a look at the moose and some greenfields and a little bit of this, a little bit of that, go for a couple of thousand miles. But there weren't any customers. Here, we're like winding around and maybe got a little shorter haul, a little more challenges. And in \u2013 we're stopping all the time because we've got customers all over the place. So they come \u2013 it comes with what it is. This is \u2013 there's a lot of business activity in the east that we have the opportunity here to take advantage of. And that's a good thing. And another part of my history goes back to my days at the Chicago Northwestern when we built the line into the Powder River Basin coal fields subsidiary called Western Railroad properties, which is about 200 miles long, hit an operating ratio that started with a four handle. So every piece of \u2013 every railroad property is different. Every railroad property is unique. Our goal is to have the best quality product and do it in the most efficient way. And if we do those two things, the thing that happens is we make a lot of money doing it. Yes, thanks. Look, if I was to look at percentages, when you think about it, our attrition rate is somewhere around 8% per year, so what we want to do is kind of front-load that attrition rate, keep a good eye on our discussions with Mark and his team to make sure we're ahead of that business that might be coming our way as we progress through the year, which then allows us to backfill the rest of that attrition towards the back end of the year. If the business doesn't come, we'll be in a situation where we can at least attrit out to the end of the year and go from there. So, as Jim said, it takes four to six months to make a conductor. So, we don't get ahead of this now and the business comes along, we're going to be leaving it on the ground, and that's the last thing we want to do. Absolutely. That's how we're setting it up. And look, on the asset side, in particular, locomotives, we started this back in 2017 with almost 4,000 locomotives, our fleets down $21.50, I think, today, right around that area. So, we've got hundreds of locomotives still in storage ready to pull out when needed. But we're also continuing to invest in our locomotive fleet. I mean our CapEx coming up this year. We're going to continue to rebuild locomotives. We've got 67 in the plan this year, and continuing to do that as we go forward. It's really important that we continue to invest in the assets that we have. And that allows us to put trip optimizer, distributed power, fuel savings, as well as reliability. So, we're comfortable with the assets that we have now. We just want to continue to invest in rebuilding what we have going forward. Yeah. Let me just make a general comment and then Jamie can answer you into details about where we are in terms of headcount. I think the railroads are not unique in the second half of the year. This phenomena with everyone trying to keep up with this unprecedented volume is creating issues whether it be in foreign ports, whether it be in ocean vessels, whether it be in the West Coast ports, the East Coast ports, the railroads, the trucks, logistics service providers, you name it. Everybody is dealing with a situation where volumes are unprecedented and volatile. At the same time, when we have hundreds, literally hundreds of employees are sick or in quarantine. In one day, it's on the west side of the railroad. The next day, it's on the east side of the rail. The next say, it's in the north side of the rail, next day it's in Florida. And so for us to be doing the job from a service standpoint right now, I don't think anybody is saying, they're having problems because the railroads are screwed up. We're doing a really, really, really good job of managing our way through this. And I'll let Jamie talk in some more detail about what it is we're doing. Yes. And by doing all those things correctly in a coordinated fashion between operations and sales and marketing, that's what's driving this business from the highway onto the rail. Yes, David, the hiring is really offsetting the attrition that we expect through the full year. But really front-end loading that so we can get ahead of it and react to any volume upside that could occur in the second half. Let me start with the look at the trip plans on the intermodal side. Look, we have -- we considered probably on both ends, the most stringent trip plans out there with respect to always making sure that we measure both loads and empties, whether that's intermodal or on the merchandise side. And I'd like to say our times are probably some of the most stringent times out there where, on the intermodal side, you're arriving to the minute. Over the past couple of months or a month or so, UPS peak was amazing. It was a big, big quarter. I don't think that's a surprise. And as we felt some pressure at different ports in different areas, we got the opportunity to move even more UPS traffic than we expected to. So some of our international traffic may have -- that isn't as time-sensitive, may have taken a little longer to get off the port than we normally would to make sure we move the time sensitive traffic. But going forward, I fully look at our numbers with respect to the intermodal side, 90% above is where we should be getting. I mean, we're shooting for above 95% on that, and I'm confident that our team is there. And we're starting to see some of those numbers hit already as we've moved past some of that UPS peak. On the carload side, again, you missed by two hours on the carload side, that's it. It's failed, whether it's a loader or empty, and our connections are tight from terminal to terminal. And if you have some of those COVID pockets, we're 40% of your terminals off, and it takes you an extra six or eight or 10 hours to get a car to a terminal, that's a failure. We're not willing to change our standards and our metrics with respect to where they sit to getting to that last mile. So we're going to work through this, which we have. We've seen some improvement on the numbers. Not as quick as I would like to see some of those continue to move forward. But we do have the best metrics with respect to those who look at trip plans out there today. So we're confident that moving forward, we're going to see that number get up into the 80s. And our target will continue to be to push forward with that, which will allow that reliability for Mark and his team to go up there and continue to sell this product that we've built."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. After a challenging year, we are all excited to turn the page to 2021. That said we accomplished a lot this past year, which sets us up well, as the economy recovers from the impact of the pandemic. While many markets remain challenged, we did see an improving business environment in the fourth quarter and as a result delivered both volume and operating income growth for the first time in 2020. We manage costs through the year and made sustainable improvements to the train plan which will drive operating leverage as volumes return. We once again delivered a quarterly record operating ratio. Excluding real estate gains, this marked the third quarterly record in 2020, an extraordinary accomplishment by this entire team. This past year, we focused on what we could control. Navigating the uncertain and volatile business environment, while successfully driving efficiencies across the business. Our goal in 2021 and beyond is to leverage the growth ahead of us, by sustaining these efficiency gains and driving further improvement across the business. Looking at the fourth quarter income statement. Revenue was down 2% as continued volume growth and pricing gains in our intermodal business were offset by the ongoing effects of weak coal demand and lower fuel recovery. Merchandise revenue was in line with the fourth quarter of 2019, but we have seen positive momentum as revenue improved 5% sequentially and from the third quarter, above normal seasonality. Total expenses were down 7% in the quarter on a 4% increase in volume, walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was 11% lower, reflecting the benefit of the train plan optimization and an 8% reduction in total headcount. Throughout 2020, our operating team continued to refine the train plan in response to the dynamic volume environment. These improvements enabled significant efficiency in the fourth quarter, as crew starts were down 11% and while overall volumes were up 4%. Lower crew starts in the quarter also translated to fewer active trains and, as a result, reduced the need for locomotives. The smaller fleet drove a 14% reduction in our locomotive labor expense. We were also able to hold the line on the significant reductions made earlier in the year to our engineering contract labor expense, as well as our intermodal terminal workforce, even as volumes continue to increase sequentially. Lifts per man-hour, a key measure of efficiency for our intermodal workforce improved 23% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Moving forward, we are preparing for growth. The current environment remains challenging and unpredictable with COVID related mark offs, significantly impacting pockets of our network. We wish the best for these employees and hope for their speedy recovery. Moving forward, we will hopefully begin to see improvement from current levels. We continue to focus on crew availability and are currently accelerating our first half hiring efforts to be prepared in the event of stronger demand. We expect headcount will likely exceed attrition in the first half of the year to provide flexibility, should demand surprise positively, particularly in the second half. We will manage it closely and adjust accordingly, as we monitor the trajectory of the potential volume recovery. MS&O expense increased 4% or $19 million in the fourth quarter. Adjusting for the $20 million headwind from real estate gains, MS&O expense would have been roughly flat, as efficiency and volume-related savings were offset by inflation and other items. The improvements to our train plan, I mentioned before, also drove savings, including lower crew travel and repositioning costs, as well as lower locomotive materials and contracted service expense. Real estate gains were minimal in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2020, we continue to manage a pipeline of future properties that we will monetize when conditions are favorable. Our base case is for real estate sales activity to be roughly flat. As I've said before, we will also continue to pursue opportunities to leverage our real estate to generate recurring revenue streams. Fuel expense was $77 million favorable, a 36% improvement year-over-year, driven by a 33% decrease in the per gallon price and record fourth quarter fuel efficiency. We continue to invest in technologies that will drive further improvement in fuel efficiency, widening the advantage over truck and demonstrating our continued commitment to sustainability. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $3 million or 1% in the quarter. This reflects a larger asset base as well as the impact of a road and track depreciation study. Depreciation expense is expected to be a $10 million to $20 million headwind in 2021. Equipment rents expense increased $4 million or 5%, as higher days per load across all markets resulted in increased freight car rents. Turning below the line. Interest expense was flat, as higher net debt balances were offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Other income decreased $48 million, reflecting a make-whole charge related to the early redemption of $500 million of long-term notes that were set to mature in 2023. Income tax expense increased $24 million or 11%, due to higher pre-tax income, as well as the cycling of certain state and federal tax benefits recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019. Closing out the income statement. CSX delivered operating income of $1. 2 billion, reflecting a fourth quarter record 57% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 15. On a full year basis, capital investment was relatively flat even during the pandemic, we remain committed to investments that prioritize the safety and reliability of our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure. This commitment will not change. And by level loading the maintenance spend, we are improving the safety and fluidity of our network without requiring a step-up in core infrastructure spend going forward. Capital allocation remains a focus. And we have a healthy pipeline of high return investments, we expect to invest in this year. In 2020, free cash flow before dividends was $2. 6 billion, down versus 2019, primarily reflecting lower operating income but also impacted by lower proceeds from property sales. Free cash flow generation remains a key focus of this team. Even during 2020's challenging environment, free cash flow conversion, while net income was about 95%. We expect to stay above 90%, even with slightly higher CapEx and an increase in expected cash tax rate. Our cash and short-term investment balance remains strong, ending the quarter at $3.1 billion. Our expectation remains that this balance will normalize over time as we continue to invest in the business and return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Yes. I think, as I mentioned last quarter, we had the greatest contribution from our Intermodal business, which has traditionally been viewed as a least profitable segment of our business. But yes, we put up a record OR. I think we again proved that in the fourth quarter. You saw the intermodal business, obviously, having the strongest growth. And again, we were able to deliver record OR performance As we go into 2021 as with any year, there's normal inflation costs that you have to offset and overcome as you want to improve your margins going into next year. We have labor inflation a little bit higher than what we saw in 2020. We have health and welfare costs ticking up a little bit more than what we saw last year. But really inflation, when I look over the long-term average, it's probably a little bit under that long-term average, so not a huge significant headwind. But really, the variable here is going to be the growth. I'm very confident if growth exceeds our expectations that we'll drop that through at a very attractive incremental margin. Our goal here is to be prepared for the growth to grow operating income. That's really the goal of what we're talking about around here. It's exciting to talk about and prepare for growth. And so that's what we're looking at. I mentioned in the first-half of the year, we'll accelerate our hiring to make sure we're prepared for whatever environment comes in the second-half. And Jamie will quickly adjust accordingly if things change on us, which as we know, this has been a dynamic environment and we just want to be ahead of the curve and be prepared for it and be able to deliver. I think we all say, shame on us, if we can't deliver the growth when it comes. And so that's what we're talking about here internally. Yes. I think when you look at the first half of the year, we'll have some fuel surcharge. Fuel will still be a headwind really in the first quarter, will start -- that will start to moderate as you get in the second quarter. So, second half of the year, you'll see a little bit less fuel surcharge headwind. Coal in the first half of the year, probably on a yield basis, will be a little bit of a headwind. Obviously, that market's pretty dynamic, particularly on the export side. But see some support going in the second half of the year. So, I would say, definitely expect second half to be improved over first half, but that always goes back to mix as well as we see some of our higher RPU business, whether it's chemicals or other areas, see continued strength, that certainly helps the dynamic there. But the coal dynamic should moderate first half of the year and really not be as much of a headwind going forward. No. This is \u2013 and maybe I'll hand it over to Jamie to talk a little bit about his strategy and what he's really planning for here. But no, these aren't in order of magnitude, huge step-up in our hiring process. A lot of it to get ahead of the attrition rates that we see coming ahead in 2021. And really, I think we're pretty confident that, again, we're going to have the operating leverage that we've continued to deliver. So I wouldn't expect headcount to go up more than the volumes that we're going to see and the revenue increases, and we'll adjust the model accordingly as I think we have more visibility, hopefully, going forward on where volumes are trending. We've seen a lot of volatility in every market out there. And hopefully, the volatility starts to diminish here a bit as we move to the second half of the year. Jamie? Yes, I'll take the comp per employee. Look, as I talked about in my opening remarks, we're going to see a little bit of more labor inflation this year. We'll see the management increase take effect here, January 1, which is a little bit different than what we've seen in previous years. So, that will be effective in the first quarter. But overall, I think historically, we talked about this 3% increase and without knowing what really incentive comp can move around quarter-to-quarter. All those things, I think a 3% kind of range is a good starting point. The first quarter, better than the fourth quarter. Yeah. Again, I think we gave relative revenue guidance because there is a little bit of uncertainty, I think, as you get into the second half, hopefully, some of these initiatives that Jim talked about will take hold and we'll see the economy strengthened through the back half of the year. I think we're real comfortable just saying that we're pretty confident in the incremental margins that we've been able to deliver, and we'll continue to do that, particularly if we get stronger revenue growth than we expect there. So that's the opportunity. On the MS&O, when you look at the fourth quarter, really, we're able to deliver what we thought we're going to do when we guided in the third quarter. Real estate sales going into 2021 will be flat, so not a real big factor or driver on those costs on a year-over-year basis. We do expect inflation to hit us in 2021 there. But again, it's an area where we have a lot of focus, and we'll continue to try to find opportunities to take out costs. So I think expect some normal inflation impact to that line item, but nothing real impactful there moving into 2021. It will move also with volume. So if volume is a little bit higher than what we expect. You would see some variable costs move up with that as well. Yes. I think, look, I would expect something lower by the time we exit this year. So yes, I think that's probably a this year event. We'll watch it closely here. Certainly, as we get more comfortable with the trajectory of the economy and those things, we'll have those discussions internally here on what makes sense. We always want to be opportunistic. So we'll be there opportunistically in the stock as well. So it gives us a lot of flexibility. We're going to generate a lot of cash this year as well. So it's a good position to be in. It's a position of strength. And we'll do the best we can. Well, I think a lot of this, I think, is going to give us the ability to hit the hot pockets where we were low on crews right now and it's really redistributing Jamie, correct me if I'm wrong, \u2013 redistributing a lot of the employees to where we were going to need and where we see the growth coming. Yes. I think when you look at our coal business; fourth quarter was -- showed a little bit of strength versus previous three. So, we're exiting the year at a little bit better position than what we saw, call it, the middle of the year here. Going into next year, probably the strength that we anticipate will really be on the domestic side with a little bit of the utility stockpiles below normal levels. So, we see some opportunity there. You see the same benchmark prices on the export side that we see. They stabilize, which is a good sign. They're still well below the levels that we saw pre-pandemic, whether that's an opportunity from here, we hope so. I think the risk/reward is probably a little bit more balanced than it has been in previous years or particularly coming into 2020. So, you're probably referencing the China, Australia, spat they have on the coal side right now, not helping the global prices right now and so not really helping us. So, hopefully, that gets resolved, and we'll see some maybe net price upside here going forward, but that's a very difficult market for us to predict. On the thermal side, if you look at our business today in the fourth quarter, really, that export business is 75% med and 25% thermal. If you get some of these polar vortex impacting some of the global markets and get a cold wave here. Maybe that's an opportunity because we're delivering very little to Europe and other areas today. So, we're going into the year cautiously optimistic. I don't see a huge upside case, but see a little bit of stability and strength off of the fourth quarter. Well, as I said, there's -- there are a lot of different views on what the underlying number is going to be. And so right now, we're not -- we're trying to find what is the most reliable number for us to look at. And also at the same time, as you know, everybody is adjusting their numbers and to a large degree, from -- they're adjusting them down. So, our guys don't necessarily have -- our guys have a -- I'm sure they have -- they have an independent view, but it's not something that we're going to put out there as what we think right now is something that we're willing to bet the pharma, and so to speak, and how we're going to run the company. We're trying to look at all the different viewpoints and as we move further into 2021, hopefully, things get clearer and clearer for us as we progress. Yes. Like I said, the revenue -- or the fuel surcharge will be a headwind in the first quarter. That will weigh on the yield similarly to what we saw in the fourth quarter here. That will moderate in the second quarter and then I think you'll see some improvement. I always have to caveat it with mix matters, right? And depending on what markets, hopefully, the strong markets, like our chemical business and others, continue to have some upside, and that will obviously be a huge impact to our yield performance. If the coal export market strengthens, as you know, our contracts are structured to participate in the commodity prices, if they strengthen. So that would be also an opportunity for us into the back half of the year. Offsetting that, I think, we are still very bullish on, as you heard us talk about on the intermodal side, it's a really good business for us. It happens to have a lower RPU, but we make good money there. And so we would -- Jamie is ready to handle more growth there, and we have a great team going after more opportunities. So, although, it's equal, where we see it today, which will change probably tomorrow. Yes, a little bit of headwind in the first quarter, probably strengthening into the back half of the year. Well, we don't see real-time -- some of our partners see in terms of price. We'll generally see a lag there. There's also inflation adjusters that occur, they want a lag basis as well. So, again, it kind of fits with my commentary around probably second half, hopefully showing some improvement over the first half. Unfortunately, in strong markets, we don't get to reprice our entire book of business. Today, these things happen over time. We'll need the markets to remain strong and supportive. And so that yes, I think we're somewhat optimistic, but there's a lot of \u2013 time will tell. What happens going forward, if the economy can strengthen in the back half of the year that certainly will help the discussions our sales and marketing team are having. So they're out there selling the business hard right now."

            "content": "I think, Jim, really nailed it with respect to some of the pockets we're seeing and why some of the levels aren't where they were historically. But you really look at some of the stuff that we have gained though as well. When you look at \u2013 to a 19% all-time record train length increase year-over-year, the fuel efficiency, everything else that we've been able to keep and maintain and continue to move forward as we talk about 2021. I can tell you today, as we see -- Jim said, hundreds and hundreds of employees are off, that's correct. And as we start to see 100 employees less, let's say, today than we were a few weeks ago, yes we're starting to feel that we're getting even more fluid. So as those numbers come down, we feel like we have the right number of people out there, if we -- if everyone returned to work. Now I wish, I could predict where the next pocket was going to be and try to send people that way, but it's difficult to do that. So yes, we're going to hit some bumps and bruises, I think, over the next quarter or so. On some of our service levels, but we are pushing. And is there a limit where we're happy? No, absolutely not. We've got -- if anyone wants to ask the question, is there anything left? What else are you going to continue to do, it's normally a question we get asked. Well, our dwell and velocity isn't where it needs to be. That's an opportunity. So as we continue to maintain all the hard work that we've done with the new plan, and the team that I've got out there working hard day in and day out on dwell and velocity and what's going on in the terminals, we're going to get that much better. And as business comes back and as we do some hiring, it helps us move the new commodities that we have come online. But really, what we have today is just a matter of dealing with the pockets that are out there. I can tell you, it is a daily exercise in trying to understand how some terminals we work around 40% of our employees being off on COVID. It doesn't just normally hit a small percentage. We do have it across the property. But we have some pockets where 40% of our employees are gone for a period of time. We've got a great team that moves into there, helps out. We work ourselves through it. We work around it, which is great about the network we have as we can do that, and continue to move the product. Look, we will see our numbers continue to improve as we move forward. But again, it's -- sometimes it's a daily exercise depending on where we're having our COVID issues. Well, we -- again, we've never said that we are singularly focused on one thing only, and that's trying to get the operating ratio down. And just in simplistic terms, if you want at a 50 operating ratio, we'd have a 50 operating ratio. We do it like quickly. I'm not sure what would be left to the company in the process.  But \u2013 so it's always a balance between trying to do things as efficiently as you possibly can. While you're delivering a good product to the customer, so you can grow the business. And that's always from day one, since I walked in the door here being the plan. And it just takes a while to get the railroad to run right because you can start to be able to generate some new business. So the algorithm going forward is the algorithm that we've had in place for the last 3 going on 4 years, focused on delivering a really high-quality, good, reliable product to the customer, which allows you to get more business. And if you do that, you drive a whole bunch of unnecessary costs out of the company and you increase efficiency. When you do that, you make a lot of money and you make a lot of money, shareholders are happy. That's our simple business plan. Government stability that too much to ask for. I would be \u2013 that would be a good start. So let's give them a couple of weeks to figure out whether or not we're going to have debt, and then we can start figuring out, if there's any significant real change in anybody's agenda. We're used to working with not only on the federal level. But we operate in 22, 23 states. Some of them are led by a Democratic Governor and some are led by a Republican Governor. So we're used to dealing with all kinds of philosophies in viewpoints as it relates to government relations with business. And so, it's not new to us. We'll just figure out what to do and how to interact, and then we'll get along fine with everybody. No, not necessarily. I mean, again, there's a mix -- there's a remix. There's a mix on the STB that goes back and forth in terms of whether it's -- now, I guess it's two-three versus what it was before, maybe two-three, versus maybe what it was at one point in time. So, again, this is something we're always dealing with. We're not unique in the sense that we're a regulated -- or we have a regulator. And so, it's not like every airline railroad, telephone company, TV company, you name it, anybody that's got a regulator, all of a sudden is worried about the end of days. We just adapt, and we figure out what it is their concerns are. And we work appropriately with them. And we've been doing this for a couple of hundred years and doing it successfully."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CSX Corporation Q3 2020 earnings call. As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.\nBill Slater: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer, Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\nJim Foote: Thanks Bill and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. The last six months have truly been surreal. On last quarter's call, we discussed the largest and most rapid sequential volume declines in CSX's history. Now, just three months later, record sequential increases. Think about that. Volume declines and increases twice as steep as the largest moves we experienced in the great recession in a span of just a few months. Managing this historic volatility is incredibly difficult and I am extremely proud of the dedicated men and women of CSX as they continue to deliver against these challenges. Their hard work allowed us to efficiently absorb the record rebound in volumes while maintaining high level of service. This level of execution requires a commitment and coordination of the entire organization. Throughout this period, it has been inspiring to see CSX employees band together to reassess every aspect of the business and figure out where we can be even better. We are already seeing the benefits of these efforts in this quarter's results and will continue to do so in years to come. Now let's go to slide five for an overview of our financial results. Second quarter EPS declined 11% to $0.96 and our operating ratio of 56.9% remained in line with last year's record results. Maintaining this record efficiency level despite the combined headwinds from the pandemic, significantly weaker coal markets and approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from lower real estate gains is truly impressive. Moving to slide six. Third quarter revenue declined 11% on 3% lower volumes, due primarily to reduced industrial activity as a result of the pandemic. Merchandise revenue declined 7% on 5% lower volumes with all end markets experiencing volume declines. Intermodal revenue was flat on 7% higher volumes as growth in both domestic and international volumes from inventory restocking and a tightening truck market were mostly offset by declines in fuel surcharge revenues. Coal revenue decreased 36% on 27% lower volumes as the coal business continues to be negatively impacted by reduced electrical demand, lower industrial production and lower global benchmark prices. Other revenue was down 12% due to lower affiliate revenue and declines in demurrage charges. Turning to slide seven. We cannot achieve any of our long term goals without first operating safely. In the third quarter, we realized new quarterly record lows for both train accidents and personal injuries as well as a new quarterly record for low personal injury frequency rate. While CSX continues to lead the industry in safety metrics, we can never be satisfied if even one of our employees gets injured while at work. The team is working to be even better by identifying and eliminating unsafe practices and conditions across the railroad. We continue to increase employee training and engagement with the goal of improving critical rules compliance. Turning to slide eight. Our safety focus is part of CSX's broader commitment to ESG and driving positive social impact. Rail is the most sustainable mode of land transportation and we are working hard every day to further these inherent benefits and ensure CSX is the most sustainable railroad. We made great strides in reducing our emissions and fuels consumption, including setting another fuel efficiency record this quarter by consuming only 0.93 gallons of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles. And we have also set ambitious new long term emissions targets to continue this positive momentum. Earlier this year, we were the first U.S. Class I railroad to have an emissions reduction target approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative, setting a goal of reducing emissions intensity 37% by 2030. In addition to improving our emissions profile, we are focused on helping our customers meet their own emissions reduction targets. Not only does every shipment on CSX consume 20% less fuel than it did a few years ago, but our best-in-class service product uniquely positions CSX to help customers further reduce emissions by converting freight off the highway and onto CSX without sacrificing the reliability of their supply chain. We are honored by the recognition received today, including recently being named one of the Top 20 Most Sustainably Managed Companies in the World by the Wall Street Journal, but continuously push ourselves to be even better for our employees, our customers and the communities we serve. On slide nine, let's review our operating performance. Despite the challenges presented by record volume increases, the railroad continues to run at a high-level. Planned changes enacted in the second quarter drove strong productivity gains across the system. We further balanced the network and set a new quarterly record of 93 distributed power trains per day, averaging over 100 distributed power trains per day for the last two months of the quarter. Yard productivity also improved by blocking cars further upstream, reducing touches in the yards and finding new ways to be more dynamically share work between yard and local trains. Slide 10, these productivity gains are further highlighted, which compares current volume and asset levels against the pre-COVID levels from March 1. In total, volumes ended the third quarter above the pre-COVID levels, while asset counts were lower across the board. Looking at train starts, we are currently handling 3% more volumes with 11% fewer starts than we required on March. On a year-over-year basis, train starts were down 15% in the third quarter compared to a 3% lower volume. Additionally, since the May trough, we were growing volume twice as fast as we have increased the train starts required to serve this growth. No matter how you frame these results, the strong operating leverage highlights the durable nature of the changes made last quarter and is a testament to the team's success in taking advantage of the challenging volume environment to pull forward lasting efficiencies. I am sure you might have some questions for Jamie on this later in the call. Let's turn to slide 11 and our hourly trip plan performance. Carload trip plan performance of 73% and intermodal of 74% slightly trailed previous quarters due primarily to the timing lag at the beginning of the quarter when we began to step up to handle the surge in volumes. Trip plan performance improved throughout the quarter and we exited the third quarter near 80% trip plan performance level for carload and 90% level for intermodal. I will now hand it over to Kevin to review the financial results.\nKevin Boone: Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. What a year it's been so far. Just three months ago, we were reviewing second quarter results, where we experienced record declines in customer business activity. We rapidly adapted and focused on driving efficiencies and structural changes that would serve us well as volumes returned. As you can see from our third quarter results, CSX was able to deliver, generating very strong operating leverage on a sequential volume increase of over 20%. As we sit here today, we are positioned for growth with a strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile. We also made the strategic decision to continue to invest in our infrastructure at levels exceeding plan. As we leverage these efficiencies, we took advantage of slow business activity. This will position us well to absorb future volume as growth returns. As you can see in the income statement, revenue was down 11% in the quarter. And volume growth at intermodal was offset by economic headwinds and merchandise combined with weak coal demand. While merchandise and coal markets remain challenged, revenues improved sequentially each month through the quarter. Partially offsetting the ongoing revenue headwinds, overall expense was down 11% on a 3% decline in volume. Walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was 10% lower, reflecting significant efficiency improvements and lower volume-related costs. As Jim highlighted, we took the opportunity during this pandemic to make structural changes to the train plan. As a result, crew starts were down 15% year-over-year, compared to a 3% decline in volume. These improvements were made across the line of road, yard and local train plans. Fewer crew starts results in fewer active trains. The active locomotive count was down 14% year-over-year in the quarter. The smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and fuel and freight and car repair efficiencies helped drive a 19% reduction in the mechanical workforce. You will recall, the overtime was a key cost lever for us in the second quarter. As volumes recover, we can flex back up using overtime where it makes sense, without adding headcount. Even with a small increase in overtime expense versus second quarter, we still reduced overtime year-over-year across all operating departments, by a total of 15%. We were also able to maintain significant reductions made in the second quarter through our engineering contract labor expense in our intermodal terminal workforce, even as volumes increased sequentially. You will note, the average headcount was roughly flat versus the second quarter, as the increase in the team headcount was offset by the impact of our management restructuring as well as the cycling of the emergency reserve boards from last quarter. MS&O expense decreased 7% in the third quarter, despite cycling some significant prior year impacts that nets to $40 million in headwinds. These include $65 million in real estate gains as well as non-railroad asset impairment. Adjusting for these impacts, MS&O would be down 15%. With fewer active locomotives and ongoing freight car repair efficiencies, locomotive support costs were down 24% and car material expense was 36% lower in the quarter. In addition, as volumes grow, we are absorbing it and driving efficiencies at our intermodal terminals with cost per container down over 25% year-over-year. We are focused on reducing cost across all areas, including optimization of utility contracts to reflect current consumption levels and increased use of efficient lighting, minimizing the use of external and contracted labor where possible and leveraging technology to reduce redundancies. These and other initiatives will continue to help control costs, as volume returns. Real estate gains were minimal in the third quarter and we continue to expect minimal sales activity in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2020, we continue to manage a pipeline of future properties that we will monetize when conditions are favorable. As I have mentioned before, I am also excited about additional opportunities to leverage our real estate and generate recurring revenue streams. Fuel expense was $104 million favorable, a 47% improvement year-over-year, driven by a 36% decrease in the per gallon price, lower volume, recycling of prior-year net expense related to non-recurring state fuel tax matters and record fuel efficiency. Ongoing fuel efficiency gains are enabled by a relentless focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software, combined with train handling rules compliance. Looking at other expenses. Depreciation increased $10 million or 3% in the quarter. Equipment rents expense increased $3 million or 4% due to higher intermodal related equipment cost and inflation. Turning below the line. Interest expense was essentially flat. Its higher net debt balances were mostly offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Income tax expense decreased $37 million or 14%, primarily resulting from lower pre-tax income. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.1 billion, reflecting a 56.9% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 15. On a year-to-date basis, capital investment is roughly flat. We remain committed to investments that prioritize the safety and reliability of our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure. We use this opportunity to negotiate better materials and outside service costs, utilize track time to drive efficiencies and reinvestment savings into the network to take advantage of the lower train activity levels. We have spent a lot of time evaluating our non-infrastructure related capital and have made progress prioritizing high return projects, while also eliminating projects that are no longer needed long term. Capital allocation remains a focus as we identify and prioritize investments that will drive high returns in the future. Through the third quarter, free cash flow before dividends was $1.9 billion down 30% versus prior year, reflecting lower operating income, but also including impacts from lower proceeds from property dispositions. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Even amidst a challenging environment, free cash flow conversion on net income remains nearly 100%. Our cash and short term investment balance remained strong, ending the quarter at $2.9 billion. As I have referenced previously, I expect this balance to normalize below $1 billion over time. As you saw with our announcement today of another $5 billion share repurchase program, we remain committed to ongoing return of capital with flexibility to remain opportunistic. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJim Foote: Great. Thanks a lot, Kevin. Concluding on slide 16, we are continually assessing the pace of economic activity and we will respond to the prevailing environment by delivering customers the highest levels of service and reliability in the most efficient manner. We were encouraged by the speed at which volumes recovered from the trough, particularly the strength in the intermodal market. Fourth quarter volumes to-date are up year-over-year and we all hope for continued positive economic momentum. As for capital expenditures, we still expect to be at the low-end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. This ability to confidently invest in our business throughout the cycle is a direct result of our industry leading free cash flow profile and is a testament to the work done to transform this company. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. We recently affirmed this commitment by expanding our recent purchase program by $5 billion bringing our total buyback authority to more than $6 billion. We entered into this pandemic period in a position of strength and confident that CSX would emerge a stronger company. I am proud to say that by staying true to our core values of operating safely, operating efficiently and helping our customers succeed by providing high level of service, we are a better company today. Thank you. And I will now turn you back Dollar Bill.\nBill Slater: Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAllison Landry: Thank you. Jim, so you talked about the trip plan compliance improving throughout the quarter and it sounds like it ended at least fairly close to where you were in the past few quarters. But what is the take from here to get those numbers up further? And then maybe, specifically if you could address on the carload side, where do you think you need to be ultimately to start to chip away at the opportunity to convert the merchandize volume from the highway? And then do you think this is something that could start to accrue in 2021? Or is this more of a 2022 and beyond story? Thank you.\nJim Foote: Well, Allison, it's a perfect question. Let me just say and then I will turn it over to Jamie and Mark to follow-up, in terms of trip plan compliance. The surge of volumes was a challenge, but we are going to get back. Number one, we are going to get back to where we were and we are going to get back to where we were as quickly as we can. And then we are going to get better and we are going to get better and we are going to get better and we are going to get better. And Jamie can talk about some of the details associated with that.\nJamie Boychuk: Absolutely. Look, as we continue to analyze the plan and we made our changes throughout the last few months, we wanted to make sure that everything we gained with respect to our train footage and train tonnage, road starts, that we didn't lose any momentum on that side. And as Jim had said, the traffic was really, at times it was all over the place and it was coming at different bubbles. We weren't sure exactly where it was going to end up. Working really close with Mark and his team, we were able to pull off some pretty amazing results, making some large reductions. If you take a look at just our train, year-over-year, our train length is up 13%, our train tonnage is up 12%. We are able to do that with like 350 less locomotives. So there's a lot of assets that we were able to pull out as we were making these changes and really, it's about exercising our people and getting them up to speed on running a network that's a little bit different than what we were used to, making that 18% reduction in road starts and longer trains, heavier trains. In some areas, some of the execution wasn't perfect, maybe what we were used to at the time. If I take a look at some of the areas, where we missed on our trip plans, it was only within a few hours. It wasn't like it was days. And really for us, service is all about reliability. So it's really important for us to get that reliability to the customer and we are working on it each and every day and we will continue to push that forward. And I will let Mark comment on the other.\nMark Wallace: Yes. It's a great question, Allison. And everything Jamie and his team are doing to continue to deliver great service for our customers is really helping us win share in the marketplace with our customers. As we sit down and we open up their books and look for opportunities to gain share in lanes where maybe they haven't traditionally used our rails, they have been more truck focused or in some lanes in order for us to gain more of their wallet share, we are seeing a number of these wins even during Q2 and Q3. So as the service continues to get better and it will, we are going to find more of those opportunities. We are excited by them. We are growing a lot. We have seen a lot of good wins in forest products and metals and even in bulk markets like ag. We are seeing some great truck conversion wins. So the team is focused on it. We are identifying them. And thanks to the service product that Jamie and his team are delivering to us, that's making those opportunities easier with those conversations with our customers.\nAllison Landry: Thank you guys for the great color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hi. It's actually Brandon with Barclays, unless there has been a big M&A transaction on the bank side. But Jim, I just wanted to ask you, there is a narrative out there with a lot of investor focus at other railroads and with the sectors doing really well. But you guys have already gone through your PSR and if you look at your former employer, obviously some pretty big valuations north of the border. So I guess what do you want investors to measure against the next few years to hopefully regain some of that relative valuation premium to reflect your cash flow today?\nJim Foote: Well, we don't measure ourselves necessarily against the other railroads. I guess if they thought we have already gone through, but that's only because we are so far ahead of them right now, all they see is our tail lights. And so yes, we are benchmarking against what we think are excellent operating companies out there and also looking at how we can continue to expand our services and help Mark out in any way he can possibly do to continue to grow our profile and grow our revenue base. And that's what this company has been about since the first day I got here. You can't really sell anything until you got a good product and we have created a fantastic and excellent product. And now we are going to continue to sell it.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Our next question is from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. First of all, I am glad Brandon is still at Barclays. I got worried there for a second. Congrats guys, Jim, Kevin, Jamie and everybody on the strong operating results. I was hoping you could give us maybe some high level thoughts as we enter into 2021, specifically about the point at which you guys just have to add back costs more meaningfully given the recovery in revenue. It's obviously pretty amazing to see close to a 20% sequential increase in revenue and headcount be flat to down, MSO to be down pretty materially sequentially. If you can just talk about the runway on that type of performance in terms of the revenue versus cost performance and just how incremental margins can trend relative to the 80% that you guys achieved in the third quarter? Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Hi. Amit, it's Kevin here. We are not going to get in to the 2021 guidance at this point. But, when we think about --\nAmit Mehrotra: No. I am not asking for 2021 guidance.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I got it.\nAmit Mehrotra: It's more like the mismatch. Okay. Yes. Go ahead.\nKevin Boone: Yes. When we think about, to your point, incremental margins, clearly what we were able to do here in the third quarter versus second quarter shows the power, the leverage we have in the model. Certainly, if we see volume increase at a good pace next year, we will have to add some headcount. That will be a good new story. It won't be one for one. Maybe I will let Jamie talk to that a little bit, but we are preparing for that. We are preparing for growth around here. But we have done a lot of things structurally, when you look at our management workforce, you look at our G&A cost, that will certainly leverage in the next year. So a lot of work that we have accelerated next year that I would fully anticipate that we take advantage of going forward. The fortunate part is, through this pandemic we invested in our network. We have a lot of capacity. I think that actually differentiates us in the market today from what we have heard out there. So we have the ability to grow and grow at the volumes there. And so that's what we are all talking about right now as we look out to 2021, what that might look like? How do we resource for it? But still keeping an eye and capturing all the things that we have done over the last six to seven months and not losing those great efforts that we were able to achieve.\nAmit Mehrotra: So it sounds like -- yes, I am sorry.\nJim Foote: As Kevin noted, I mean we have got a network that we can still bring on 20% to 30%. We are quite comfortable with continuing to bring on business, as we move forward. But I mean, look at the plan. The plan itself is running well. We continue to analyze it. We continue to execute and we will analyze and execute and continue to work very close with Mark's team with all new business opportunities that are out there. We have got a number of locomotives in storage that we can pull out. We are going to be doing some hiring. We have got some hiring classes out there with some T&E employees. And I think it's important that we stay ahead of what we see coming forward as well as working very close with our union groups and making sure that we are hand in hand with supplying the service that we said we would. And look, I have said it time and time again and I think we have proved it. We don't bring on assets unless they earn their keep and we sweat them. So that's what we are going to continue to do is to stick on the same model that we have been working towards.\nAmit Mehrotra: Is the comment on 20% to 30% volume growth, a capital, a CapEx comment in terms of not needing to add CapEx? Or is that also a comment about not needing to add a significant amount of OpEx to -- yes, go ahead?\nKevin Boone: As I said, Amit, look on the CapEx side, we have got a great plant out there. We have got long sidings. We have got a double-track. We have got a good mainline. We have got good yards. So yes, absolutely, we can continue to absorb business on our mainline as Mark and his team brings it off.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon. And congrats on the really strong results. Great to see. Maybe I don't know, Jim or Mark, if you could just talk a little bit about pricing? What you are seeing in the marketplace? Obviously, your competitor is focused on and region focused on yielding up. Yet you still seem to be taking share. Maybe you could talk us through a little bit because obviously with down 8% on our revenue for car, it's tough to see on the mix impacts overall. You can talk a bit about what's going on in pricing and business wins?\nMark Wallace: Hi Ken, hope you are doing well. So let's go back on the different markets. Merchandise RPU down 2%, fuel surcharge was a 3% headwind this quarter, to that intermodal RPU down 6%, fuel surcharge 4% and coal RPU down 12%, fuel surcharge was 3% headwind. The rest obviously, the delta there mix and price for coal most of that was due to price just given some of the export benchmarks that we saw and the softness in the domestic utility markets. Now, obviously mix continue to play an overall driver of RPU. This quarter like it always does, there was a negative mix overall. We saw that in metals and equipment and chemicals. There was positive mix in some like coal, export coal. We had favorability due to the thermal exports declining faster than the net exports. And minerals also saw some larger declines in shorter haul Northern aggregate business. That was just basically giving some of the budget cuts and some of the project cuts, because of COVID-19. So mix is always a bit of an issue for us, as you know. We are probably, Ken, going to see continued 7% to 8% gap between volume and revenue going forward into the Q4. I would expect that to sequentially improve into Q1 and beyond. Pricing, our pricing philosophy has not changed and price continues to be a main focus for the team as we deliver on sustainable and profitable growth. We are partnering with our customers to create solutions to help them grow and price to the value of the service product that Jim and his team are delivering. And I said it before and I will say it again, we are not sacrificing price for volume.\nKen Hoexter: Wonderful. I appreciate the thoughts. Thanks Mark.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. Mark, I have got, I guess, a question for you or a question, if you will. How are you thinking about, I guess, you had kind of two different dynamic where the consumer and retail side has been super strong and trucking and intermodal tight and industrial has been kind of slower rebounding. What's your thought on industrial view? Are you optimistic that you are seeing signs of that picking up? And what is the customer seeing in the industrial side? Are they seeing a lot of tightness in truck that really encourages conversion to rail? Or are they not seeing such a tight market, given that the industrial side maybe hasn't improved like the retail and consumer side? Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Yes. So it's a great question. And so we are seeing a tight, obviously it's a tight truck market out there. Things are, on the intermodal side, clearly there is capacity has been constrained, replenishments have been going on. There has been some driver shortages in several markets like Southern California, Chicago, et cetera. We have seen some good pick up in some truck conversions with our intermodal businesses, as Jim highlighted. Our intermodal trip plan performance has been quite good. Our service has been quite good. So we are happy with that and I think that will continue obviously. The consumer is still very, very strong. We expect a robust peak season around Thanksgiving time usually when we see that e-commerce peak to Christmas time. We expect that to be very strong. Actually, it has been strong through the pandemic. Just as people have been staying at home and ordering stuff online. But we expect it to pick up even more robustly going forward, as we approach Thanksgiving. So looking for that to continue through Christmas. And then overall intermodal, we are quite happy with the business and speaking with our customers, we expect that to continue deep into Q1. So good side there. I think on the merchandise side, on the industrial side, the tighter truck market obviously has allowed us to sit down with our customers and have different conversations. They are looking in these tight times now and their business levels are down to save some cost. Obviously transportation costs, for them, is a significant headwind. And so as we all know, the 12% to 15% discount that rail offers given with our good service product has allowed us to go and sit down with our customers and they can't get trucks. The truck market is tight. The spot rates are up. And so we are seeing conversions there. And we hope that continues and hopefully that traffic that comes to us remain sticky even post things do improve and the truck market eases up a little bit. If we are able to show the power of rail and keep performing like we know we can, hopefully a lot of that traffic will stick on CSX going forward.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thank you. Operator The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So Kevin, on the MS&O costs, I know they are lumpy, but anything unusual or one-time-ish in this quarter? Any thoughts on how to think about MS&O in the fourth quarter, up or down? And then I was just wondering with the buyback, any thoughts on timing? Are you guys considering an ASR? And does this change your leverage targets in anyway? Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Yes. Let's start with the MS&O. No, I wouldn't call anything extraordinary unusual in the third quarter. Usually what's unusual or what the analysts like yourselves like to call out with the real estate, which was almost de minimis in the quarter. So nothing there and obviously we had a year-over-year headwind, when you look at real estate gains. We had some significant gains last year and didn't have that this year. When we look to fourth quarter, we always have seasonality. This is around a number of areas in our business. When I look at engineering, the extra costs related to the winter, vacations start, the capital teams once they go on vacation, on to vacations, start to hit OE expense. We have G&A seasonality in the fourth quarter. So I would expect some year-over-year improvement in MS&O into the fourth quarter when you exclude the real estate from last year there. So we will see an uptick in MS&O sequentially, but still year-over-year improvement excluding the real estate gains from last year. What was the follow-up question?\nScott Group: Just about the buyback and timing and leverage targets and all that.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think we are going to evaluate the buyback program. Jim and I talk closely. I think as we get more visibility, stability in the markets here, as we get more clarity around the pandemic and the implications there. Clearly $2.9 billion of cash is not what we need to operate our business. So I would expect that to trend down in the next year. So you could expect us to be back in the market.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for taking the question. Kevin, one more for you. How are you viewing the opportunities in the land portfolio with gains pretty much minimal here for the rest of the year? And maybe if you can elaborate on some of those recurring revenue streams that you are evaluating? As you look at this book of business, are there more ways to grow in the future and convert traffic off the halfway with maybe leveraging some of that land for the industrial development projects?\nKevin Boone: Absolutely. We are in great conversations. I actually just had the opportunity to hire a new head of our real estate group. I am very, very excited about what she is going to drive here at the company. She has hit the ground running here over the last few weeks. But she is working really closely with Mark's team on the industrial development side and identifying areas where we might be able to locate whether it's warehousing, other opportunities, whether it's us investing in those assets or partnering with others that know how to do it. So it's a great opportunity for us. In terms of the real estate sales, I mentioned it on my prepared remarks, we have a great pipeline. These things, we are going to sell when the time is right, when we can maximize value. But there is still a robust pipeline. It will probably be lumpy from here. But I am pretty excited about what we have in store over the next few years there. These things tend to take time to get to a close, but we are working pretty hard on that area. And then just on the recurring revenue side, it's something that I have asked the team to really focus on over the next six months. Whether it's electronic billboards, whether it's more fiber, anything we can do to leverage our real estate portfolio. These are great, great opportunities. And once you sign these contracts, they continue. You get revenue every year after year. So, it's really, we are one of the largest landowners in the Eastern United States. We should leverage that as much as we can. And so, I have challenged the team to go out and do that. And I think they are doing a good job so far.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thanks, Kevin. Appreciate the update on that.\nOperator: Next question is from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon guys. On slide 10, you have an interesting chart on operating leverage. And it really shows how much the resources have flattened out even as volume has continued to improve kind of coming out of August and into September and October. Conceptually, is there a point with volume growth that you feel like there will be a step function higher in some of these resources? Or can you continue to maintain, do you feel like you have capacity with the resources that are operating right now even as volumes are kind of ticking up, Jim, as you mentioned here in the fourth quarter?\nJim Foote: Well, clearly, it's a two-part question, which I think Jamie answered a second ago. We have got a ton of capacity and availability to bring on more business from a physical infrastructure perspective without spending any capital to do that. But you are not going to grow the business forever without having to add additional employees, mainly because we have tons of locomotives in storage and all of that. So the question is, with your operating performance. When you get to the point where your train length gets to the point where long enough or heavy enough where you need to split that train. And when you split at train, you need to have the additional employees to utilize in order to be able to operate it. And so we are moving in to a new level now. But what you have seen over the last few years and what was highlighted in great detail in the last few months is, today we can do things from a staffing perspective the railroads and the peers couldn't do. Listen, I have been doing this a long time. If you would had this kind of traffic surge across the rail network in North America four, five years ago, we would be now talking about gridlock across all the major cities in the country and we wouldn't be doing anything. And now with the common mindset of how you run a railroad, we are able to respond, we are able to pivot, we are nimble, we can add capacity, we can shrink capacity, we can right size our business and we can do that much more effectively and much more logically and thoughtfully. And God, I hope we get to the day sooner the better. But we got to start hiring more and more people because the business is growing and growing and growing and Mark is just not going to mile of the park every single day. But in the meantime, we are not going to add back assets, as Jamie said, when we don't need them. But the minute we do, we talk about that on here five times a day, the minute we do, we will put them on so we can move the freight.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I want to go back to an earlier question. Can you refresh us on your comfort level with leverage, given some of the uncertainty on either tax policy, economy, et cetera? With that buyback, what are the guardrails of the upper ends that you are watching for to perhaps tap the brakes once you start buying stock again?\nKevin Boone: Look, as I talked about, we have $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. So I have got to get through that before we ever even would think about leverage. Plus, we are generating significant amount of cash at this point. So when you look at the algorithm that we can create with that and it's quite compelling where we are on the leverage standpoint, we are in a great position. We didn't go under stress during this significant decline in the second quarter. We had access to capital, which is what we always want to have with our strong investment grade rating. So that's important. And you want to be at a point where you can always have the ability to be opportunistic. And so I think where we are today allows for that flexibility. If the opportunity arises, we can react and leverage the opportunity when it's there. So, I think we are quite comfortable today with where we are.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. So headed into this year, you had talked about some irregular year-over-year headwinds. Kevin, I know you had called out D&A, lower gains on sale, real estate sales, other revenue. I know you are not giving guidance on 2021, but just from a high level, are there any unique items like that that we should be modeling? Or do you think next year, it's more of a clean year where we should see the underlying operating leverage of the business play out?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean, we will obviously get more into that on the next call here. But depreciation would be a similar headwind to what we have right now. But I would also point out our depreciation relative to our CapEx is probably the smallest gap in the industry right there. So probably not the step-up that we saw this year on the depreciation side. We don't have any significant life study that created a headwind this year. Real estate taxes will continue to be a headwind in the next year, probably around the same level it was. Maybe a little bit less of a headwind going into next year. Inflation, we think inflation remains relatively modest. No significant pick up there, which is good. Outside of that, as we get into it on the next call, we will highlight any other things that come up.\nJustin Long: Okay. And based on your comment about D&A being pretty close to CapEx, it sounds like your expectation for 100% free cash flow conversion isn't going to change in the near term?\nKevin Boone: We are very focused on our free cash flow conversion.\nJustin Long: Okay. I will leave it at that. Thanks for the time.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Ross with Stifel. Your line is open.\nDavid Ross: Good morning, gentlemen. Lots of good stuff to talk about. But I want to talk about one of the lingering pains in terms of coal. What's the latest on inventory levels and outlook? I think Kevin your recent comments at an industry conference about maybe getting flat to up comps in 2021. So any more color on coal would be helpful.\nKevin Boone: Yes. Sure, David. So you want to just stick to domestic coal? Or are you interested in export as well?\nDavid Ross: Give it all for me.\nKevin Boone: All right. Perfect. We will start with domestic. That's the largest part of our coal business. So the stockpiles right now, to your question, are at or below sort of averages, both in the North and in the South. We have seen a good summer for burn. It was kind of hot both in North and South. So the stockpiles did diminish a bit. Gas prices, net gas prices, we saw them creep up to $2.50 or so. They came back down. Now they are back up to the mid to high twos. We would like to see them above $2.80, really the economics work for the utilities to start to burn more coal. I am really encouraged by sort of the November contract and the forward curve into 2021, as we see it above $3, which is quite encouraging. So hopefully that continues and we can expect to move more coal going into the new year and in Q4, in the back half of Q4. On the export side, starting with met. Met, right now, it's actually about 75% of our export portfolio. It used to be about 60%. It was about 60/40, 65/35. But now it's about 75% met, 25% thermal. Most of that met is going to Europe, about 55%, 30% to Asia. The benchmarks, as you know, have been challenged. We saw some restocking in the quarter in India and Brazil. Unfortunately the Chinese quotas on Australian coal have been a headwind as that's keeping the benchmark prices low and it's offsetting some of the outputs for our U.S. coal. So we have had some issues there coupled with monsoon season and obviously the COVID situation has really impacted industrial production worldwide. But mostly, the met side of the business has really been a price story, more than a volume story. Different on the thermal side, it's really been a volume story. Our thermal coal, about 75% of that thermal coal goes to Asia, mostly India, some to Morocco as well. No longer any coal going to Europe, which used to be a big outlet for us. But we have no thermal coal going to Europe these days. API2 has been a headwind. It was under $60 for the quarter. India, the COVID situation in India has really impacted a lot of the volumes there. However, things are picking up and we should see some increased volumes in the fourth quarter and we will see what happens as the COVID situation plays itself out going into next year. At the beginning of the year, we provided some guidance on our export coal. We said we were going to be somewhere around 30, low 30s million tons for 2020. My best guess right now is, we will be right at 30 million tons for the year.\nDavid Ross: That's helpful around the world color. Thank you very much.\nKevin Boone: Yes. No problem.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. I know you have talked about sort of the lasting efficiencies and the structural changes. Maybe I missed it a little. But I was wondering, if you could perhaps give some further example of what some of these changes are that has allowed metrics such as cars processed per hour do so well? Or even frankly, just keeping headcount flat while volumes sort of surged here sequentially? So I know you talked about the structural changes. I am assuming that with the operating plan and things along those lines. But to the extent you can provide some additional color around that would be great?\nKevin Boone: Thanks for the question, Jordan. I guess some of the easiest ways I can put it is, we are constantly analyzing the plan. So this is, when you think about the cars switched per man hour, I go out with a number of my team members and we take a look at different terminals and we question what we do and how we do it and change the way we do things. Just because that's the way it's always been done, doesn't mean that's how you do it. And those are kind of the guidelines when you think of scheduling railroading. So some yards you may have switched cars one way. We have been able to find different ways of switching cars that made it more efficient. And I mean that's an ongoing process that we are always going through. When you think about a network as complicated as CSX can be, we have hundreds of terminals and yards and different areas where we switch boxcars. We probably have some of the greatest opportunity to make those changes and continue to make those changes as we move forward. And then when you think about the service plan with respect to growing our train size. Well, we said it earlier that we were blessed when we got here 3.5 years ago that we have a plant that was built beyond what it needed to be. And it wasn't necessarily being run in a PSR method. So we have been able to increase our train sizes, move traffic better. And when you think about our train miles, we have reduced our train miles significantly, just by moving traffic in a better pattern. So as we continue to find those opportunities and they are still out there, we still find them each and every day. The team is evolving every day with respect to how our plan works and how scheduled railroading continues to develop those different efficiencies, there is more and more opportunities we continue forward just to find those opportunities to move things better, quicker and more reliable for our customer.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. I know you spent a lot of time on the sustainable operations and you have the slide, you added the ESG recognition. Mark, as you are talking to customers and when we think about this, is this just a nice to have for us right now, maybe some investors open up a new investor base? Or is this really starting to move the needle in your conversations with the customers as it relates to their total freight wallet? Or are those conversations still just service price?\nMark Wallace: Excellent question. No, I think ESG has really gone from a talking point to having a real world impact now, especially with our customers. And so several of our customers in several negotiations, sitting down and really peeling back and showing them everything that we have done at CSX over the last number of years. We have been a leader in this ESG space for a very long time. And as Jim said in his opening remarks, we are very proud of our leadership position there and being recognized by the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Sustainability Index and others and we are opening up having those discussions with customers and showing them that clearly our safety performance is a big discussion there as well. And I can tell you, one of the major, major contracts that came up for bid this year, one of the big factors was they really want us the business was around ESG and safety. And Jamie and I spent a lot of time with this customer talking about these things and it's having a real impact. I would tell you also, as customers look and especially some of the big shippers out there, retail shippers, as they look to their efficiency targets and their targets to emission targets, taking trucks off the highway, given all the efficiencies that Jim talked about are real. And if they can move more traffic on CSX and take trucks off the highway, that clearly leads to them achieving a lot of their efficiency metrics. And so real world impact, real world negotiations and it's paying off specifically in many deals that we have looked at this year.\nJon Chappell: That's great to hear. Thanks for the insights, Mark.\nMark Wallace: Absolutely.\nOperator: Next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hi guys. Thanks for taking the time. Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal and what you have seen in the pipeline over the next three years is going to put you guys in less of a position to maybe take what the truck market gives you and more of a position to maybe improve the product, either at an infrastructure level or channel level as you think about what you guys are investing in the intermodal side? what is it that's in the pipeline that you are excited about that's going to get you maybe a little bit better than market growth in that market?\nMark Wallace: Yes. So let me talk about the market and then I will ask Jamie to talk about some of the efficiencies that they are working on in the terminals, because his group has the intermodal terminals. And so listen, we really like, we love the intermodal business. We think there is a lot of growth. And as I have said before, this intermodal space is one where we can continue to grow faster than the economy repeatedly every year. And so we are doing a lot of different things, working on a lot of new different products with customers, looking to take more share off the highway, really talk about the benefits of intermodal. We have lot of customers out there and we are working with them and the different shippers on the benefits of converting that freight. E-commerce is obviously having a very big impact on our business. And we like that business and we think it's going to continue to grow here in the future. And so we are thinking differently about things that we need to do going forward and position ourselves to capture a lot of that e-commerce growth in the future. With that, Jamie, do you want to talk about the efficiencies in the terminals?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. Our terminals, again, we have got terminals that were, I think, probably over built for the time when they were built and we are actually getting to utilize them to a maximum. I have got an unbelievable intermodal team led by Marcelo Estrada and Scott Marshall and their team. They have been able to, over a number of years here, put automated cranes and technology with XGate, allowing truck drivers to flow freely in and out of our terminals, giving us opportunities to use GPS cranes to operate autonomously in some areas. So we have been able to bring our dwell times down over the past couple of years from up over 24, 26 hours down to 15 to 14 hours in some circumstances of origin dwell. That's significant. When you turn your traffic over in these terminals, you gain space. You are able to handle more. And the traffic volume just come our way. We haven't hit a bottleneck. We are definitely inviting more and more come through the gate and looking forward to it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good evening everyone. Kevin, maybe, just to start off with you. You obviously have the high quality problem of apparently having more cash than you know what to do with. So maybe you can share some of your thoughts on the M&A environment. You have seen some of your peers going to make investments in infrastructure assets, both rail-related and adjacent. So do you have any opportunities out there on this? And kind of do you expect to move on that anytime soon? And Jim, maybe as a follow-up on the ESG question. Obviously very exciting and very encouraging to see that come up so much. But do you get the sense that shippers are looking to move from truck to rail on a structural basis? Or are they seeing rail as somewhat of a stop gap until we get to electrified trucks? I am trying to figure out how do you make these ESG gains sticky.\nJamie Boychuk: All right, let me answer the second question first. Absolutely, it's significant. It's a significant change when major, major customers, users of the logistics supply chain globally begin to make public commitments to reducing their carbon footprint. To be able to walk in the door and say, I can help you do that. In fact, I might even be able to make you get to your targets about it like a decade early because I am 75% cleaner than all these trucks you got running around out there and I am just as reliable. The good news was that we couldn't do that if there was ESG 10 years ago or whatever, we weren't reliable enough, you wouldn't be able to have this kind of conversation. So the timing of our service offering coming together with a real, not just PR, but a real commitment globally to people that want to be able to do this is creating a lot of opportunity for us in all lines of our business and we want to be as environmentally responsible as we can be. And so to the extent we move coal, people don't like that, but to the extent that we can be a huge player in other lines of business and be a facilitator for improvements from a client perspective, that's a great news for us. I will let Kevin follow up a little bit. But on the M&A issue. We have got a tremendous amount, as I said earlier, I can't remember what's the reason for the question was, but from an M&A perspective, as it relates to rail, to the extent that we now have a common focus and a common purpose across the rail network as individual entities, it is opening up great opportunities for us to work together to further become more effective and efficient as we interchange traffic with one another, as we do business with one another, as we understand our systems and we get to exchange for information with one another better than we did before, all with the sole purpose of being able to grow the business on a network basis, it creates the capabilities for the individual companies to achieve a lot of the benefits and the synergies, that before everybody thought, well, the only way you can do that is go out and spend a couple of hundred billion dollars to buy some other railroad. You know, we don't look like it. We are much, much smarter than what we used to be. And so we are eagerly pursuing all of those kinds of opportunities today with the sole purpose because it makes us better competitors individually, as individual railroad companies and as an industry.\nKevin Boone: Yes. And just add to that, Ravi, I think you are right in terms of our cash position today. We are in a position of strength. It gives us a lot of opportunity for us to invest in our business. It's been exciting as we have gone through our capital program, we are still going through that for next year and the years ahead, we are finding some really good opportunities on some really high return investments. And so that's going to be the first priority for our cash going forward. But as we sit here today, I would point out, we just finished a quarter where, if you look at it, intermodal for the first time, contributed the most to our revenue profile and coal was the least in our history. So on a percentage of our revenue, coal was the least it has ever been and intermodal has been the best and we did 56.9%. Here we are in a position of strength. It gives us a lot of opportunity to invest in our railroad. And we will look at anything that will strengthen our franchise over the next few years. So I am excited about looking at those opportunities and driving value for us.\nRavi Shanker: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin: Hi. Thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone. So, I want to turn, Mark, if I could to ask you about volume visibility. I know when the pandemic really hit in March, that visibility tightened up quite a bit and was difficult to see directionally which way volumes were going, other than down in the early period. And then Jim you mentioned, obviously the big rebound. Mark when you look at and speak to your customers now, how would you characterize that visibility? I know you touched a little bit on coal, you touched on intermodal with some of the opportunities there. Can you go through a few of the others and just directionally indicate whether that visibility is improving as you go into 2021? Or is it really a coin toss here as to which direction it goes kind of on a broad segment-by-segment basis.\nMark Wallace: No. Thanks, Walter, great question. I think clearly the visibility we had when the bottom fell out sort of in Q2 when the economy shut down, they didn't send notes to us or emails to us and saying, we are closing. It was kind of overnight, things just tanked. As things are coming back, our job has been, even while the pandemic was going on, the sales and marketing team were working from home, we needed a priority to stay close to our customers, check in on Zoom and Teams and all the fancy video conferencing technology. Everyone had laptops and computers at home and phones and we made it a priority for them to stay close and really figure out to the best of what they could tell us and then we can relay that information to Jamie and team. But it was a challenge for them to even know. Things were so dynamic, things were changing so rapidly. It was very tough to pinpoint them. And when the volumes came back, it was a snap back literally within days and weeks. And so it was very hard. Our auto business was effectively, you know, you would open up the morning revenue report and it was zeros and then a week later boom, the plants are reopening. And they said, we are going to one shift for probably for a month and then we will tell you when we are going to go to two. And then a couple of days later, they say, look, we are going two or three right away and it was like go wide. So we had to react pretty quickly to that and it was a challenge. Two weeks ago, we had our fifth customer engagement forum. We did it usually customers come here to Jacksonville for a day or so where we talk to them about what's going on in their markets and their business and share ideas. We did this by Zoom meeting and we spent a lot of time. Jim was there, myself and Jamie and really listening to a lot of their questions and their views on what we think is probably is going to happen, likely to happen. And I would say, most are cautiously optimistic as we head into the back half of Q4 and into 2021. There is visibility on some markets. And clearly intermodal, we know what's happening there and we have got some pretty good visibility. We talk to our channel partners in the ports and our international steamship lines and clearly they are seeing a lot of strength in those markets and the best visibility they have now is, we see continued strength and replenishment beyond Chinese New Year and deep into Q1, as I said earlier. So from that perspective, good. Coal I talked about a little bit earlier and while we started to clearly the markets are dynamic there and we will see what happens with natural gas domestically. But the world markets clearly have an impact on our export business. And for merchandise, I mean, lot of people are watching what's going on? There still remains many risks, right. The pandemic, what's going to happen with the pandemic. There is other geopolitical factors that we are monitoring extremely closely. The election is coming up in a couple of weeks. Government stimulus, as I said, the effects of the pandemic and on their workers and everyone is watching that. I mean we are heading into the fall and into the winter and people are concerned if the cases spike again, will they be able to continue producing. And then the health of the overall economy and what's that going to look like as we head into the end of the year and into next year. So visibility is murky. It's been a challenging year, probably something that none of us have ever seen in our careers before. But our job is to continue to stay close and provide as much clarity as we can to Jamie and the team so that we are prepared to handle the freight when it comes back.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. That's great color. I appreciate it, Mark.\nOperator: Our last question is from Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: Yes. Thank you, operator. And guys, I appreciate the opportunity to back clean-up here. Jim, you mentioned something that intrigued me. You mentioned about railroads now working more together than they have in the past. I was wondering, if you can give us some examples of what you guys are doing now? And also, do you see more of that in the future as some of your other partners go more through the life cycle of PSR?\nJim Foote: Jamie might be able to jump in with a little bit. Exactly. Again, we basically or have had a group of individuals that work together for years and years and years and built this model that more efficiently and effectively and reliably runs a railroad company. And they are now in one way, shape or another, having a significant influence on how those companies operate. And we think of ourselves, obviously, as standalone entities. But we want to work together from an industry perspective so that we can grow the business. It's not about forcing unnatural gateways to move traffic farther and out of routes or maybe you can make an extra $12.50 per car by hauling something 500 miles longer. And at the end of the day, when you have business practices like that, you drive all business off the railroad and it moves by truck. So at the end of the day with a narrow focus like that, you are shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, cut and cut and cut and cut and shrink and shrink. So we are all about growing the business and to grow the business by working together as a network, 50% of the business originates on somebody else or terminates on somebody else. So I am not an island. And so I think that's the MO going forward and it's not a foreign concept. When you talk to the other railroad executives, whether it's me or it's Jamie or it's Mark or whether it's anybody else in the organization, there is a much greater sense of urgency and a much greater focus on customer service than I think there has been in the past. And hopefully that not only continues, but hopefully we will begin to get better and better and better at that, so we can become more relevant in the transportation market place and grow what today, the overall share of our transportation spend is very, very small. So we want to get bigger.\nJamie Boychuk: Just, I would say, Jim nailed it down. When you have a partner that thinks like you and acts like you, it sure makes it a whole lot easier to do business with them. Always, we had issues over the years with interchange points. Traffic will get locked up there. Customers didn't have visibility between railroad and railroad. So as we continue to have partners around us, who are getting better and better at what they do, it makes a big difference for our customers and it helps to grow the industry. So it's exciting to work with some of the western roads, who are really starting to come around and work with us. And of course, the Canadians know the game. So it makes a big difference when we can all flow together.\nJason Seidl: Well, I appreciate the color and time as always, gentlemen. Thank you.\nOperator: And this does conclude today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation on today's call. And you may now disconnect your lines.\nJim Foote: Thank you, everyone, for participating.",

            "content": "Absolutely. Look, as we continue to analyze the plan and we made our changes throughout the last few months, we wanted to make sure that everything we gained with respect to our train footage and train tonnage, road starts, that we didn't lose any momentum on that side. And as Jim had said, the traffic was really, at times it was all over the place and it was coming at different bubbles. We weren't sure exactly where it was going to end up. Working really close with Mark and his team, we were able to pull off some pretty amazing results, making some large reductions. If you take a look at just our train, year-over-year, our train length is up 13%, our train tonnage is up 12%. We are able to do that with like 350 less locomotives. So there's a lot of assets that we were able to pull out as we were making these changes and really, it's about exercising our people and getting them up to speed on running a network that's a little bit different than what we were used to, making that 18% reduction in road starts and longer trains, heavier trains. In some areas, some of the execution wasn't perfect, maybe what we were used to at the time. If I take a look at some of the areas, where we missed on our trip plans, it was only within a few hours. It wasn't like it was days. And really for us, service is all about reliability. So it's really important for us to get that reliability to the customer and we are working on it each and every day and we will continue to push that forward. And I will let Mark comment on the other. Yes. Our terminals, again, we have got terminals that were, I think, probably over built for the time when they were built and we are actually getting to utilize them to a maximum. I have got an unbelievable intermodal team led by Marcelo Estrada and Scott Marshall and their team. They have been able to, over a number of years here, put automated cranes and technology with XGate, allowing truck drivers to flow freely in and out of our terminals, giving us opportunities to use GPS cranes to operate autonomously in some areas. So we have been able to bring our dwell times down over the past couple of years from up over 24, 26 hours down to 15 to 14 hours in some circumstances of origin dwell. That's significant. When you turn your traffic over in these terminals, you gain space. You are able to handle more. And the traffic volume just come our way. We haven't hit a bottleneck. We are definitely inviting more and more come through the gate and looking forward to it. All right, let me answer the second question first. Absolutely, it's significant. It's a significant change when major, major customers, users of the logistics supply chain globally begin to make public commitments to reducing their carbon footprint. To be able to walk in the door and say, I can help you do that. In fact, I might even be able to make you get to your targets about it like a decade early because I am 75% cleaner than all these trucks you got running around out there and I am just as reliable. The good news was that we couldn't do that if there was ESG 10 years ago or whatever, we weren't reliable enough, you wouldn't be able to have this kind of conversation. So the timing of our service offering coming together with a real, not just PR, but a real commitment globally to people that want to be able to do this is creating a lot of opportunity for us in all lines of our business and we want to be as environmentally responsible as we can be. And so to the extent we move coal, people don't like that, but to the extent that we can be a huge player in other lines of business and be a facilitator for improvements from a client perspective, that's a great news for us. I will let Kevin follow up a little bit. But on the M&A issue. We have got a tremendous amount, as I said earlier, I can't remember what's the reason for the question was, but from an M&A perspective, as it relates to rail, to the extent that we now have a common focus and a common purpose across the rail network as individual entities, it is opening up great opportunities for us to work together to further become more effective and efficient as we interchange traffic with one another, as we do business with one another, as we understand our systems and we get to exchange for information with one another better than we did before, all with the sole purpose of being able to grow the business on a network basis, it creates the capabilities for the individual companies to achieve a lot of the benefits and the synergies, that before everybody thought, well, the only way you can do that is go out and spend a couple of hundred billion dollars to buy some other railroad. You know, we don't look like it. We are much, much smarter than what we used to be. And so we are eagerly pursuing all of those kinds of opportunities today with the sole purpose because it makes us better competitors individually, as individual railroad companies and as an industry. Just, I would say, Jim nailed it down. When you have a partner that thinks like you and acts like you, it sure makes it a whole lot easier to do business with them. Always, we had issues over the years with interchange points. Traffic will get locked up there. Customers didn't have visibility between railroad and railroad. So as we continue to have partners around us, who are getting better and better at what they do, it makes a big difference for our customers and it helps to grow the industry.

            "name": "Jim Foote",
            "content": "Thanks Bill and thank you to everyone for joining today's call. The last six months have truly been surreal. On last quarter's call, we discussed the largest and most rapid sequential volume declines in CSX's history. Now, just three months later, record sequential increases. Think about that. Volume declines and increases twice as steep as the largest moves we experienced in the great recession in a span of just a few months. Managing this historic volatility is incredibly difficult and I am extremely proud of the dedicated men and women of CSX as they continue to deliver against these challenges. Their hard work allowed us to efficiently absorb the record rebound in volumes while maintaining high level of service. This level of execution requires a commitment and coordination of the entire organization. Throughout this period, it has been inspiring to see CSX employees band together to reassess every aspect of the business and figure out where we can be even better. We are already seeing the benefits of these efforts in this quarter's results and will continue to do so in years to come. Now let's go to slide five for an overview of our financial results. Second quarter EPS declined 11% to $0.96 and our operating ratio of 56.9% remained in line with last year's record results. Maintaining this record efficiency level despite the combined headwinds from the pandemic, significantly weaker coal markets and approximately 250 basis points of unfavorable margin impact from lower real estate gains is truly impressive. Moving to slide six. Third quarter revenue declined 11% on 3% lower volumes, due primarily to reduced industrial activity as a result of the pandemic. Merchandise revenue declined 7% on 5% lower volumes with all end markets experiencing volume declines. Intermodal revenue was flat on 7% higher volumes as growth in both domestic and international volumes from inventory restocking and a tightening truck market were mostly offset by declines in fuel surcharge revenues. Coal revenue decreased 36% on 27% lower volumes as the coal business continues to be negatively impacted by reduced electrical demand, lower industrial production and lower global benchmark prices. Other revenue was down 12% due to lower affiliate revenue and declines in demurrage charges. Turning to slide seven. We cannot achieve any of our long term goals without first operating safely. In the third quarter, we realized new quarterly record lows for both train accidents and personal injuries as well as a new quarterly record for low personal injury frequency rate. While CSX continues to lead the industry in safety metrics, we can never be satisfied if even one of our employees gets injured while at work. The team is working to be even better by identifying and eliminating unsafe practices and conditions across the railroad. We continue to increase employee training and engagement with the goal of improving critical rules compliance. Turning to slide eight. Our safety focus is part of CSX's broader commitment to ESG and driving positive social impact. Rail is the most sustainable mode of land transportation and we are working hard every day to further these inherent benefits and ensure CSX is the most sustainable railroad. We made great strides in reducing our emissions and fuels consumption, including setting another fuel efficiency record this quarter by consuming only 0.93 gallons of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles. And we have also set ambitious new long term emissions targets to continue this positive momentum. Earlier this year, we were the first U.S. Class I railroad to have an emissions reduction target approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative, setting a goal of reducing emissions intensity 37% by 2030. In addition to improving our emissions profile, we are focused on helping our customers meet their own emissions reduction targets. Not only does every shipment on CSX consume 20% less fuel than it did a few years ago, but our best-in-class service product uniquely positions CSX to help customers further reduce emissions by converting freight off the highway and onto CSX without sacrificing the reliability of their supply chain. We are honored by the recognition received today, including recently being named one of the Top 20 Most Sustainably Managed Companies in the World by the Wall Street Journal, but continuously push ourselves to be even better for our employees, our customers and the communities we serve. On slide nine, let's review our operating performance. Despite the challenges presented by record volume increases, the railroad continues to run at a high-level. Planned changes enacted in the second quarter drove strong productivity gains across the system. We further balanced the network and set a new quarterly record of 93 distributed power trains per day, averaging over 100 distributed power trains per day for the last two months of the quarter. Yard productivity also improved by blocking cars further upstream, reducing touches in the yards and finding new ways to be more dynamically share work between yard and local trains. Slide 10, these productivity gains are further highlighted, which compares current volume and asset levels against the pre-COVID levels from March 1. In total, volumes ended the third quarter above the pre-COVID levels, while asset counts were lower across the board. Looking at train starts, we are currently handling 3% more volumes with 11% fewer starts than we required on March. On a year-over-year basis, train starts were down 15% in the third quarter compared to a 3% lower volume. Additionally, since the May trough, we were growing volume twice as fast as we have increased the train starts required to serve this growth. No matter how you frame these results, the strong operating leverage highlights the durable nature of the changes made last quarter and is a testament to the team's success in taking advantage of the challenging volume environment to pull forward lasting efficiencies. I am sure you might have some questions for Jamie on this later in the call. Let's turn to slide 11 and our hourly trip plan performance. Carload trip plan performance of 73% and intermodal of 74% slightly trailed previous quarters due primarily to the timing lag at the beginning of the quarter when we began to step up to handle the surge in volumes. Trip plan performance improved throughout the quarter and we exited the third quarter near 80% trip plan performance level for carload and 90% level for intermodal. I will now hand it over to Kevin to review the financial results. Great. Thanks a lot, Kevin. Concluding on slide 16, we are continually assessing the pace of economic activity and we will respond to the prevailing environment by delivering customers the highest levels of service and reliability in the most efficient manner. We were encouraged by the speed at which volumes recovered from the trough, particularly the strength in the intermodal market. Fourth quarter volumes to-date are up year-over-year and we all hope for continued positive economic momentum. As for capital expenditures, we still expect to be at the low-end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. This ability to confidently invest in our business throughout the cycle is a direct result of our industry leading free cash flow profile and is a testament to the work done to transform this company. We also remain committed to returning excess cash flow to shareholders. We recently affirmed this commitment by expanding our recent purchase program by $5 billion bringing our total buyback authority to more than $6 billion. We entered into this pandemic period in a position of strength and confident that CSX would emerge a stronger company. I am proud to say that by staying true to our core values of operating safely, operating efficiently and helping our customers succeed by providing high level of service, we are a better company today. Thank you. And I will now turn you back Dollar Bill. Well, Allison, it's a perfect question. Let me just say and then I will turn it over to Jamie and Mark to follow-up, in terms of trip plan compliance. The surge of volumes was a challenge, but we are going to get back. Number one, we are going to get back to where we were and we are going to get back to where we were as quickly as we can. And then we are going to get better and we are going to get better and we are going to get better and we are going to get better. And Jamie can talk about some of the details associated with that. Well, we don't measure ourselves necessarily against the other railroads. I guess if they thought we have already gone through, but that's only because we are so far ahead of them right now, all they see is our tail lights. And so yes, we are benchmarking against what we think are excellent operating companies out there and also looking at how we can continue to expand our services and help Mark out in any way he can possibly do to continue to grow our profile and grow our revenue base. And that's what this company has been about since the first day I got here. You can't really sell anything until you got a good product and we have created a fantastic and excellent product. And now we are going to continue to sell it. As Kevin noted, I mean we have got a network that we can still bring on 20% to 30%. We are quite comfortable with continuing to bring on business, as we move forward. But I mean, look at the plan. The plan itself is running well. We continue to analyze it. We continue to execute and we will analyze and execute and continue to work very close with Mark's team with all new business opportunities that are out there. We have got a number of locomotives in storage that we can pull out. We are going to be doing some hiring. We have got some hiring classes out there with some T&E employees. And I think it's important that we stay ahead of what we see coming forward as well as working very close with our union groups and making sure that we are hand in hand with supplying the service that we said we would. And look, I have said it time and time again and I think we have proved it. We don't bring on assets unless they earn their keep and we sweat them. So that's what we are going to continue to do is to stick on the same model that we have been working towards. Well, clearly, it's a two-part question, which I think Jamie answered a second ago. We have got a ton of capacity and availability to bring on more business from a physical infrastructure perspective without spending any capital to do that. But you are not going to grow the business forever without having to add additional employees, mainly because we have tons of locomotives in storage and all of that. So the question is, with your operating performance. When you get to the point where your train length gets to the point where long enough or heavy enough where you need to split that train. And when you split at train, you need to have the additional employees to utilize in order to be able to operate it. And so we are moving in to a new level now. But what you have seen over the last few years and what was highlighted in great detail in the last few months is, today we can do things from a staffing perspective the railroads and the peers couldn't do. Listen, I have been doing this a long time. If you would had this kind of traffic surge across the rail network in North America four, five years ago, we would be now talking about gridlock across all the major cities in the country and we wouldn't be doing anything. And now with the common mindset of how you run a railroad, we are able to respond, we are able to pivot, we are nimble, we can add capacity, we can shrink capacity, we can right size our business and we can do that much more effectively and much more logically and thoughtfully. And God, I hope we get to the day sooner the better. But we got to start hiring more and more people because the business is growing and growing and growing and Mark is just not going to mile of the park every single day. But in the meantime, we are not going to add back assets, as Jamie said, when we don't need them. But the minute we do, we talk about that on here five times a day, the minute we do, we will put them on so we can move the freight. Jamie might be able to jump in with a little bit. Exactly. Again, we basically or have had a group of individuals that work together for years and years and years and built this model that more efficiently and effectively and reliably runs a railroad company. And they are now in one way, shape or another, having a significant influence on how those companies operate. And we think of ourselves, obviously, as standalone entities. But we want to work together from an industry perspective so that we can grow the business. It's not about forcing unnatural gateways to move traffic farther and out of routes or maybe you can make an extra $12.50 per car by hauling something 500 miles longer. And at the end of the day, when you have business practices like that, you drive all business off the railroad and it moves by truck. So at the end of the day with a narrow focus like that, you are shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, cut and cut and cut and cut and shrink and shrink. So we are all about growing the business and to grow the business by working together as a network, 50% of the business originates on somebody else or terminates on somebody else. So I am not an island. And so I think that's the MO going forward and it's not a foreign concept. When you talk to the other railroad executives, whether it's me or it's Jamie or it's Mark or whether it's anybody else in the organization, there is a much greater sense of urgency and a much greater focus on customer service than I think there has been in the past. And hopefully that not only continues, but hopefully we will begin to get better and better and better at that, so we can become more relevant in the transportation market place and grow what today, the overall share of our transportation spend is very, very small. So we want to get bigger. Thank you, everyone, for participating."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. What a year it's been so far. Just three months ago, we were reviewing second quarter results, where we experienced record declines in customer business activity. We rapidly adapted and focused on driving efficiencies and structural changes that would serve us well as volumes returned. As you can see from our third quarter results, CSX was able to deliver, generating very strong operating leverage on a sequential volume increase of over 20%. As we sit here today, we are positioned for growth with a strong balance sheet and free cash flow profile. We also made the strategic decision to continue to invest in our infrastructure at levels exceeding plan. As we leverage these efficiencies, we took advantage of slow business activity. This will position us well to absorb future volume as growth returns. As you can see in the income statement, revenue was down 11% in the quarter. And volume growth at intermodal was offset by economic headwinds and merchandise combined with weak coal demand. While merchandise and coal markets remain challenged, revenues improved sequentially each month through the quarter. Partially offsetting the ongoing revenue headwinds, overall expense was down 11% on a 3% decline in volume. Walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was 10% lower, reflecting significant efficiency improvements and lower volume-related costs. As Jim highlighted, we took the opportunity during this pandemic to make structural changes to the train plan. As a result, crew starts were down 15% year-over-year, compared to a 3% decline in volume. These improvements were made across the line of road, yard and local train plans. Fewer crew starts results in fewer active trains. The active locomotive count was down 14% year-over-year in the quarter. The smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and fuel and freight and car repair efficiencies helped drive a 19% reduction in the mechanical workforce. You will recall, the overtime was a key cost lever for us in the second quarter. As volumes recover, we can flex back up using overtime where it makes sense, without adding headcount. Even with a small increase in overtime expense versus second quarter, we still reduced overtime year-over-year across all operating departments, by a total of 15%. We were also able to maintain significant reductions made in the second quarter through our engineering contract labor expense in our intermodal terminal workforce, even as volumes increased sequentially. You will note, the average headcount was roughly flat versus the second quarter, as the increase in the team headcount was offset by the impact of our management restructuring as well as the cycling of the emergency reserve boards from last quarter. MS&O expense decreased 7% in the third quarter, despite cycling some significant prior year impacts that nets to $40 million in headwinds. These include $65 million in real estate gains as well as non-railroad asset impairment. Adjusting for these impacts, MS&O would be down 15%. With fewer active locomotives and ongoing freight car repair efficiencies, locomotive support costs were down 24% and car material expense was 36% lower in the quarter. In addition, as volumes grow, we are absorbing it and driving efficiencies at our intermodal terminals with cost per container down over 25% year-over-year. We are focused on reducing cost across all areas, including optimization of utility contracts to reflect current consumption levels and increased use of efficient lighting, minimizing the use of external and contracted labor where possible and leveraging technology to reduce redundancies. These and other initiatives will continue to help control costs, as volume returns. Real estate gains were minimal in the third quarter and we continue to expect minimal sales activity in the fourth quarter. Looking beyond 2020, we continue to manage a pipeline of future properties that we will monetize when conditions are favorable. As I have mentioned before, I am also excited about additional opportunities to leverage our real estate and generate recurring revenue streams. Fuel expense was $104 million favorable, a 47% improvement year-over-year, driven by a 36% decrease in the per gallon price, lower volume, recycling of prior-year net expense related to non-recurring state fuel tax matters and record fuel efficiency. Ongoing fuel efficiency gains are enabled by a relentless focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software, combined with train handling rules compliance. Looking at other expenses. Depreciation increased $10 million or 3% in the quarter. Equipment rents expense increased $3 million or 4% due to higher intermodal related equipment cost and inflation. Turning below the line. Interest expense was essentially flat. Its higher net debt balances were mostly offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Income tax expense decreased $37 million or 14%, primarily resulting from lower pre-tax income. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.1 billion, reflecting a 56.9% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 15. On a year-to-date basis, capital investment is roughly flat. We remain committed to investments that prioritize the safety and reliability of our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure. We use this opportunity to negotiate better materials and outside service costs, utilize track time to drive efficiencies and reinvestment savings into the network to take advantage of the lower train activity levels. We have spent a lot of time evaluating our non-infrastructure related capital and have made progress prioritizing high return projects, while also eliminating projects that are no longer needed long term. Capital allocation remains a focus as we identify and prioritize investments that will drive high returns in the future. Through the third quarter, free cash flow before dividends was $1.9 billion down 30% versus prior year, reflecting lower operating income, but also including impacts from lower proceeds from property dispositions. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Even amidst a challenging environment, free cash flow conversion on net income remains nearly 100%. Our cash and short term investment balance remained strong, ending the quarter at $2.9 billion. As I have referenced previously, I expect this balance to normalize below $1 billion over time. As you saw with our announcement today of another $5 billion share repurchase program, we remain committed to ongoing return of capital with flexibility to remain opportunistic. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Hi. Amit, it's Kevin here. We are not going to get in to the 2021 guidance at this point. But, when we think about -- Yes. I got it. Yes. When we think about, to your point, incremental margins, clearly what we were able to do here in the third quarter versus second quarter shows the power, the leverage we have in the model. Certainly, if we see volume increase at a good pace next year, we will have to add some headcount. That will be a good new story. It won't be one for one. Maybe I will let Jamie talk to that a little bit, but we are preparing for that. We are preparing for growth around here. But we have done a lot of things structurally, when you look at our management workforce, you look at our G&A cost, that will certainly leverage in the next year. So a lot of work that we have accelerated next year that I would fully anticipate that we take advantage of going forward. The fortunate part is, through this pandemic we invested in our network. We have a lot of capacity. I think that actually differentiates us in the market today from what we have heard out there. So we have the ability to grow and grow at the volumes there. And so that's what we are all talking about right now as we look out to 2021, what that might look like? How do we resource for it? But still keeping an eye and capturing all the things that we have done over the last six to seven months and not losing those great efforts that we were able to achieve. As I said, Amit, look on the CapEx side, we have got a great plant out there. We have got long sidings. We have got a double-track. We have got a good mainline. We have got good yards. So yes, absolutely, we can continue to absorb business on our mainline as Mark and his team brings it off. Yes. Let's start with the MS&O. No, I wouldn't call anything extraordinary unusual in the third quarter. Usually what's unusual or what the analysts like yourselves like to call out with the real estate, which was almost de minimis in the quarter. So nothing there and obviously we had a year-over-year headwind, when you look at real estate gains. We had some significant gains last year and didn't have that this year. When we look to fourth quarter, we always have seasonality. This is around a number of areas in our business. When I look at engineering, the extra costs related to the winter, vacations start, the capital teams once they go on vacation, on to vacations, start to hit OE expense. We have G&A seasonality in the fourth quarter. So I would expect some year-over-year improvement in MS&O into the fourth quarter when you exclude the real estate from last year there. So we will see an uptick in MS&O sequentially, but still year-over-year improvement excluding the real estate gains from last year. What was the follow-up question? Yes. I think we are going to evaluate the buyback program. Jim and I talk closely. I think as we get more visibility, stability in the markets here, as we get more clarity around the pandemic and the implications there. Clearly $2.9 billion of cash is not what we need to operate our business. So I would expect that to trend down in the next year. So you could expect us to be back in the market. Absolutely. We are in great conversations. I actually just had the opportunity to hire a new head of our real estate group. I am very, very excited about what she is going to drive here at the company. She has hit the ground running here over the last few weeks. But she is working really closely with Mark's team on the industrial development side and identifying areas where we might be able to locate whether it's warehousing, other opportunities, whether it's us investing in those assets or partnering with others that know how to do it. So it's a great opportunity for us. In terms of the real estate sales, I mentioned it on my prepared remarks, we have a great pipeline. These things, we are going to sell when the time is right, when we can maximize value. But there is still a robust pipeline. It will probably be lumpy from here. But I am pretty excited about what we have in store over the next few years there. These things tend to take time to get to a close, but we are working pretty hard on that area. And then just on the recurring revenue side, it's something that I have asked the team to really focus on over the next six months. Whether it's electronic billboards, whether it's more fiber, anything we can do to leverage our real estate portfolio. These are great, great opportunities. And once you sign these contracts, they continue. You get revenue every year after year. So, it's really, we are one of the largest landowners in the Eastern United States. We should leverage that as much as we can. And so, I have challenged the team to go out and do that. And I think they are doing a good job so far. Look, as I talked about, we have $3 billion of cash on our balance sheet. So I have got to get through that before we ever even would think about leverage. Plus, we are generating significant amount of cash at this point. So when you look at the algorithm that we can create with that and it's quite compelling where we are on the leverage standpoint, we are in a great position. We didn't go under stress during this significant decline in the second quarter. We had access to capital, which is what we always want to have with our strong investment grade rating. So that's important. And you want to be at a point where you can always have the ability to be opportunistic. And so I think where we are today allows for that flexibility. If the opportunity arises, we can react and leverage the opportunity when it's there. So, I think we are quite comfortable today with where we are. Yes. I mean, we will obviously get more into that on the next call here. But depreciation would be a similar headwind to what we have right now. But I would also point out our depreciation relative to our CapEx is probably the smallest gap in the industry right there. So probably not the step-up that we saw this year on the depreciation side. We don't have any significant life study that created a headwind this year. Real estate taxes will continue to be a headwind in the next year, probably around the same level it was. Maybe a little bit less of a headwind going into next year. Inflation, we think inflation remains relatively modest. No significant pick up there, which is good. Outside of that, as we get into it on the next call, we will highlight any other things that come up. We are very focused on our free cash flow conversion. Yes. Sure, David. So you want to just stick to domestic coal? Or are you interested in export as well? All right. Perfect. We will start with domestic. That's the largest part of our coal business. So the stockpiles right now, to your question, are at or below sort of averages, both in the North and in the South. We have seen a good summer for burn. It was kind of hot both in North and South. So the stockpiles did diminish a bit. Gas prices, net gas prices, we saw them creep up to $2.50 or so. They came back down. Now they are back up to the mid to high twos. We would like to see them above $2.80, really the economics work for the utilities to start to burn more coal. I am really encouraged by sort of the November contract and the forward curve into 2021, as we see it above $3, which is quite encouraging. So hopefully that continues and we can expect to move more coal going into the new year and in Q4, in the back half of Q4. On the export side, starting with met. Met, right now, it's actually about 75% of our export portfolio. It used to be about 60%. It was about 60/40, 65/35. But now it's about 75% met, 25% thermal. Most of that met is going to Europe, about 55%, 30% to Asia. The benchmarks, as you know, have been challenged. We saw some restocking in the quarter in India and Brazil. Unfortunately the Chinese quotas on Australian coal have been a headwind as that's keeping the benchmark prices low and it's offsetting some of the outputs for our U.S. coal. So we have had some issues there coupled with monsoon season and obviously the COVID situation has really impacted industrial production worldwide. But mostly, the met side of the business has really been a price story, more than a volume story. Different on the thermal side, it's really been a volume story. Our thermal coal, about 75% of that thermal coal goes to Asia, mostly India, some to Morocco as well. No longer any coal going to Europe, which used to be a big outlet for us. But we have no thermal coal going to Europe these days. API2 has been a headwind. It was under $60 for the quarter. India, the COVID situation in India has really impacted a lot of the volumes there. However, things are picking up and we should see some increased volumes in the fourth quarter and we will see what happens as the COVID situation plays itself out going into next year. At the beginning of the year, we provided some guidance on our export coal. We said we were going to be somewhere around 30, low 30s million tons for 2020. My best guess right now is, we will be right at 30 million tons for the year. Yes. No problem. Thanks for the question, Jordan. I guess some of the easiest ways I can put it is, we are constantly analyzing the plan. So this is, when you think about the cars switched per man hour, I go out with a number of my team members and we take a look at different terminals and we question what we do and how we do it and change the way we do things. Just because that's the way it's always been done, doesn't mean that's how you do it. And those are kind of the guidelines when you think of scheduling railroading. So some yards you may have switched cars one way. We have been able to find different ways of switching cars that made it more efficient. And I mean that's an ongoing process that we are always going through. When you think about a network as complicated as CSX can be, we have hundreds of terminals and yards and different areas where we switch boxcars. We probably have some of the greatest opportunity to make those changes and continue to make those changes as we move forward. And then when you think about the service plan with respect to growing our train size. Well, we said it earlier that we were blessed when we got here 3.5 years ago that we have a plant that was built beyond what it needed to be. And it wasn't necessarily being run in a PSR method. So we have been able to increase our train sizes, move traffic better. And when you think about our train miles, we have reduced our train miles significantly, just by moving traffic in a better pattern. So as we continue to find those opportunities and they are still out there, we still find them each and every day. The team is evolving every day with respect to how our plan works and how scheduled railroading continues to develop those different efficiencies, there is more and more opportunities we continue forward just to find those opportunities to move things better, quicker and more reliable for our customer. Yes. And just add to that, Ravi, I think you are right in terms of our cash position today. We are in a position of strength. It gives us a lot of opportunity for us to invest in our business. It's been exciting as we have gone through our capital program, we are still going through that for next year and the years ahead, we are finding some really good opportunities on some really high return investments. And so that's going to be the first priority for our cash going forward. But as we sit here today, I would point out, we just finished a quarter where, if you look at it, intermodal for the first time, contributed the most to our revenue profile and coal was the least in our history. So on a percentage of our revenue, coal was the least it has ever been and intermodal has been the best and we did 56.9%. Here we are in a position of strength. It gives us a lot of opportunity to invest in our railroad. And we will look at anything that will strengthen our franchise over the next few years. So I am excited about looking at those opportunities and driving value for us."

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Yes. It's a great question, Allison. And everything Jamie and his team are doing to continue to deliver great service for our customers is really helping us win share in the marketplace with our customers. As we sit down and we open up their books and look for opportunities to gain share in lanes where maybe they haven't traditionally used our rails, they have been more truck focused or in some lanes in order for us to gain more of their wallet share, we are seeing a number of these wins even during Q2 and Q3. So as the service continues to get better and it will, we are going to find more of those opportunities. We are excited by them. We are growing a lot. We have seen a lot of good wins in forest products and metals and even in bulk markets like ag. We are seeing some great truck conversion wins. So the team is focused on it. We are identifying them. And thanks to the service product that Jamie and his team are delivering to us, that's making those opportunities easier with those conversations with our customers. Hi Ken, hope you are doing well. So let's go back on the different markets. Merchandise RPU down 2%, fuel surcharge was a 3% headwind this quarter, to that intermodal RPU down 6%, fuel surcharge 4% and coal RPU down 12%, fuel surcharge was 3% headwind. The rest obviously, the delta there mix and price for coal most of that was due to price just given some of the export benchmarks that we saw and the softness in the domestic utility markets. Now, obviously mix continue to play an overall driver of RPU. This quarter like it always does, there was a negative mix overall. We saw that in metals and equipment and chemicals. There was positive mix in some like coal, export coal. We had favorability due to the thermal exports declining faster than the net exports. And minerals also saw some larger declines in shorter haul Northern aggregate business. That was just basically giving some of the budget cuts and some of the project cuts, because of COVID-19. So mix is always a bit of an issue for us, as you know. We are probably, Ken, going to see continued 7% to 8% gap between volume and revenue going forward into the Q4. I would expect that to sequentially improve into Q1 and beyond. Pricing, our pricing philosophy has not changed and price continues to be a main focus for the team as we deliver on sustainable and profitable growth. We are partnering with our customers to create solutions to help them grow and price to the value of the service product that Jim and his team are delivering. And I said it before and I will say it again, we are not sacrificing price for volume. Yes. So it's a great question. And so we are seeing a tight, obviously it's a tight truck market out there. Things are, on the intermodal side, clearly there is capacity has been constrained, replenishments have been going on. There has been some driver shortages in several markets like Southern California, Chicago, et cetera. We have seen some good pick up in some truck conversions with our intermodal businesses, as Jim highlighted. Our intermodal trip plan performance has been quite good. Our service has been quite good. So we are happy with that and I think that will continue obviously. The consumer is still very, very strong. We expect a robust peak season around Thanksgiving time usually when we see that e-commerce peak to Christmas time. We expect that to be very strong. Actually, it has been strong through the pandemic. Just as people have been staying at home and ordering stuff online. But we expect it to pick up even more robustly going forward, as we approach Thanksgiving. So looking for that to continue through Christmas. And then overall intermodal, we are quite happy with the business and speaking with our customers, we expect that to continue deep into Q1. So good side there. I think on the merchandise side, on the industrial side, the tighter truck market obviously has allowed us to sit down with our customers and have different conversations. They are looking in these tight times now and their business levels are down to save some cost. Obviously transportation costs, for them, is a significant headwind. And so as we all know, the 12% to 15% discount that rail offers given with our good service product has allowed us to go and sit down with our customers and they can't get trucks. The truck market is tight. The spot rates are up. And so we are seeing conversions there. And we hope that continues and hopefully that traffic that comes to us remain sticky even post things do improve and the truck market eases up a little bit. If we are able to show the power of rail and keep performing like we know we can, hopefully a lot of that traffic will stick on CSX going forward. Excellent question. No, I think ESG has really gone from a talking point to having a real world impact now, especially with our customers. And so several of our customers in several negotiations, sitting down and really peeling back and showing them everything that we have done at CSX over the last number of years. We have been a leader in this ESG space for a very long time. And as Jim said in his opening remarks, we are very proud of our leadership position there and being recognized by the Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Sustainability Index and others and we are opening up having those discussions with customers and showing them that clearly our safety performance is a big discussion there as well. And I can tell you, one of the major, major contracts that came up for bid this year, one of the big factors was they really want us the business was around ESG and safety. And Jamie and I spent a lot of time with this customer talking about these things and it's having a real impact. I would tell you also, as customers look and especially some of the big shippers out there, retail shippers, as they look to their efficiency targets and their targets to emission targets, taking trucks off the highway, given all the efficiencies that Jim talked about are real. And if they can move more traffic on CSX and take trucks off the highway, that clearly leads to them achieving a lot of their efficiency metrics. And so real world impact, real world negotiations and it's paying off specifically in many deals that we have looked at this year. Absolutely. Yes. So let me talk about the market and then I will ask Jamie to talk about some of the efficiencies that they are working on in the terminals, because his group has the intermodal terminals. And so listen, we really like, we love the intermodal business. We think there is a lot of growth. And as I have said before, this intermodal space is one where we can continue to grow faster than the economy repeatedly every year. And so we are doing a lot of different things, working on a lot of new different products with customers, looking to take more share off the highway, really talk about the benefits of intermodal. We have lot of customers out there and we are working with them and the different shippers on the benefits of converting that freight. E-commerce is obviously having a very big impact on our business. And we like that business and we think it's going to continue to grow here in the future. And so we are thinking differently about things that we need to do going forward and position ourselves to capture a lot of that e-commerce growth in the future. With that, Jamie, do you want to talk about the efficiencies in the terminals? No. Thanks, Walter, great question. I think clearly the visibility we had when the bottom fell out sort of in Q2 when the economy shut down, they didn't send notes to us or emails to us and saying, we are closing. It was kind of overnight, things just tanked. As things are coming back, our job has been, even while the pandemic was going on, the sales and marketing team were working from home, we needed a priority to stay close to our customers, check in on Zoom and Teams and all the fancy video conferencing technology. Everyone had laptops and computers at home and phones and we made it a priority for them to stay close and really figure out to the best of what they could tell us and then we can relay that information to Jamie and team. But it was a challenge for them to even know. Things were so dynamic, things were changing so rapidly. It was very tough to pinpoint them. And when the volumes came back, it was a snap back literally within days and weeks. And so it was very hard. Our auto business was effectively, you know, you would open up the morning revenue report and it was zeros and then a week later boom, the plants are reopening. And they said, we are going to one shift for probably for a month and then we will tell you when we are going to go to two. And then a couple of days later, they say, look, we are going two or three right away and it was like go wide. So we had to react pretty quickly to that and it was a challenge. Two weeks ago, we had our fifth customer engagement forum. We did it usually customers come here to Jacksonville for a day or so where we talk to them about what's going on in their markets and their business and share ideas. We did this by Zoom meeting and we spent a lot of time. Jim was there, myself and Jamie and really listening to a lot of their questions and their views on what we think is probably is going to happen, likely to happen. And I would say, most are cautiously optimistic as we head into the back half of Q4 and into 2021. There is visibility on some markets. And clearly intermodal, we know what's happening there and we have got some pretty good visibility. We talk to our channel partners in the ports and our international steamship lines and clearly they are seeing a lot of strength in those markets and the best visibility they have now is, we see continued strength and replenishment beyond Chinese New Year and deep into Q1, as I said earlier. So from that perspective, good. Coal I talked about a little bit earlier and while we started to clearly the markets are dynamic there and we will see what happens with natural gas domestically. But the world markets clearly have an impact on our export business. And for merchandise, I mean, lot of people are watching what's going on? There still remains many risks, right. The pandemic, what's going to happen with the pandemic. There is other geopolitical factors that we are monitoring extremely closely. The election is coming up in a couple of weeks. Government stimulus, as I said, the effects of the pandemic and on their workers and everyone is watching that. I mean we are heading into the fall and into the winter and people are concerned if the cases spike again, will they be able to continue producing. And then the health of the overall economy and what's that going to look like as we head into the end of the year and into next year. So visibility is murky. It's been a challenging year, probably something that none of us have ever seen in our careers before. But our job is to continue to stay close and provide as much clarity as we can to Jamie and the team so that we are prepared to handle the freight when it comes back."

During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Chief Investor Relations Officer for CSX Corporation.\nBill Slater: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\nJim Foote: Thanks, Bill, and thank you to everyone for joining our call this afternoon. Wow where do I start talking about this quarter. This was the most disrupted quarter I have experienced in my career with both the fastest decline in volumes followed by one of the most rapid increase in volumes in the company's history. Reacting to those extreme swings while dealing with the pandemic has been and continues to be challenging. CSX employees have been absolutely amazing in their response and I want to thank them for the hard work and dedication to keep the rail road running well. And I would be remiss if I didn't extend special recognition to our employees and their families who have fallen ill from the virus. Our thoughts are with them. In difficult times strong companies adapt and that's exactly what we have done. Despite all that has been accomplished to date and CSX's transformation we are still finding opportunities to be better, faster and more reliable. The actions taken over the past months will not only make CSX more efficient but more importantly they will allow us to be better delivering service to our customers in the future. Turning to the presentation, on slide 5 is an overview of our financial results which Kevin will discuss later. Due to the economic impact of the pandemic second quarter EPS declined 40% to $0.65 while the operating ratio increased to 63.3%. On slide 6 you could see that all business lines were negatively affected by the pandemic. Second quarter revenue declined by 26% year-over-year on 20% lower volumes. Sequentially the volume decline was the largest in CSX's history and almost twice as severe as any quarter during the 2009 recession. Merchandise revenue and volume declined 22% with the largest headwind coming from the automotive plant shutdowns. Automotive volumes declined 71% in the quarter including six consecutive weeks where volumes were down more than 90% each week. Intermodal revenue declined 18% on 11% lower volumes as both the international and domestic businesses were impacted by lower consumer and industrial demand. Coal revenue decreased 48% on 44% lower volumes. Both the domestic and export markets were negatively impacted by weak demand, from the combination of reduced power consumption, low natural gas prices and export benchmark prices. Other revenue declined 19 % due to lower affiliate revenue and declines in demerged charges and intermodal storage revenues. Turning to slide 7. Safety remains my top priority. Even though we had an all-time low number of train accidents in the quarter, the frequency rates for both train accidents and personal injuries increased due to the lower level of volumes. While CSX continues to lead the industry year-to-date in safety we must do better. We will never be satisfied with our performance if any of our employees get injured while at work and we are undertaking a comprehensive safety engagement initiative this quarter focused on strengthening critical rules compliance and systemically identifying and eliminating unsafe acts. Moving to slide 8, let's review our operating performance for the quarter. Despite the challenging operating environment the railroad continued to run at a high level. The operating team successfully implemented significant plan changes while maintaining fluidity and driving efficiencies across the railroad. In addition to these service design changes we also drove increased yard productivity setting a new record for cars handled per hour worked. Additionally, CSX continues to lead the U.S. class 1 railroads in fuel efficiency setting a new quarterly operating record of 0.96 gallons of fuel per thousand gross ton miles. Fuel efficiency along with ESG more broadly are priorities for our team. We are focused on leveraging the inherent benefits railroads have as the most sustainable mode of land-based transportation and are working hard to make sure CSX is building on these benefits to continue leading the industry in safety and sustainability. The topics of ESG and driving positive social impact are critically important to CSX, our customers and the communities we serve and we look forward to providing additional detail and key initiatives in our sustainability report to be released later this month. Slide 9 clearly highlights the unique operating challenges faced during the quarter. As volumes dropped more than 25% and then bounced back nearly 20% since Memorial Day. The team acted decisively to adjust the network for the changing volumes reducing total train starts roughly in line with volume declines and realizing line of road efficiencies even greater than the volume declines. These results reflect the strength of our operating model and the ingenuity of our team. In addition to consolidating trains across the network, they found new opportunities to integrate auto and unit trained business into the merchandise and intermodal networks as well as other unique service changes to be more efficiently leverage yard and local operations. When volumes began to recover late in the quarter we started recalling employees and added train starts to meet demand but we are confident that many of the changes we made during this period are durable and make CSX a stronger company. Slide 10 shows our hourly trip plan performance in the quarter. Car load trip plan performance of 80.5 was consistent with first quarter results and intermodal performance remained high at 94%. Volume has been volatile but we are working closely with our customers to ensure they are appropriately resourced and prepared to handle incremental volume when it comes. I will now turn over to Kevin for more detail on the quarter.\nKevin Boone: Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. The second quarter of 2020 represented the most significant revenue drop in the company's history. [indiscernible] with an $800 million revenue decline our company clearly responded. From a cost perspective our focus through this period was to accelerate initiatives that will deliver sustainable, structural cost reductions that position us to leverage growth as the economy recovers. As a leadership team we were deliberate in our strategy, focused on avoiding the pitfalls of making short-term cost decisions to the detriment of growing the business profitably as the economy rebounds from the pandemic. As you can see on slide 12 total expense was down 19% in the face of a 20% decline in volume. This includes the impact of approximately 60 million of unique headwinds we faced in the quarter which included lower real estate gains, severance costs related to a management restructuring, specific COVID-19 related costs, higher depreciation and property tax as well as equipment impairments in the quarter. Excluding these items costs would have been down 22% year-over-year. I frequently get asked a question especially over the last three months how much of your cost base is fixed versus variable and naturally everyone wants to hear how variable it is when volumes are declining and how fixed it is when volumes are on the rise. The reality is very little of our expense just falls out with lower volume. Action and a lot of hard work is required. It's a balance to ensure we variabilize the cost structure while maintaining service levels. In the second quarter we successfully identified creative solutions to help drive efficiency on a long-term basis. Some of these efforts will show up near term while others will benefit us in the quarters ahead. As volumes improve off the bottom I am confident you will see very strong operating leverage driven in part by a lot of the hard work and effort the team has put in over the last several months. Walking down the expense line items, Labor and fringe was 22 % lower reflecting the benefit of reduced crew starts, lower operating support costs and reduced labor at our terminals as well as dramatically lower overtime spending. Crew starts were down 24% exceeding volume declines in the quarter and saving over $70 million in total T&E labor expense. Additionally, the active locomotive count was down 25% year-over-year in the quarter, the smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 20% reduction in the mechanical workforce while at the same time reducing mechanical overtime expense by 56%. We continue to remain extremely focused on overtime. The workforce efficiency and management execution we reduced over time across all operating departments by 50% versus the prior year driving $20 million of overtime savings in the second quarter alone. We also achieved significant largely sustainable reductions in our engineering contract labor expense and our intermodal terminal workforce. In addition to these efficiency improvements we had $39 million of lower incentive compensation expense in the quarter primarily reflecting lower projected payouts on existing plans. Finally, the quarter included $10 million of severance costs resulting from a management restructuring to align our resources and improve efficiency. From these actions we expect $25 million in ongoing annualized savings. As I've described before MS&O expense tends to be less volume variable than labor but we still reduce this line item by 9% in the second quarter or 14% when you adjust for the impact of $26 million and lower real estate and line sales gains versus last year. Continued improvement to the train plan combined with increased network fluidity enabled a 37% reduction in crew travel and repositioning expenses versus the prior year. On the mechanical side the active locomotive count was down 25% year-over-year. We closed the quarter with over 1,000 locomotives and storage. In addition, newer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 20% reduction in car material expense in the quarter. The safety of our employees remains CSX's number one priority. In the quarter we spend approximately $10 million in COVID related supplies to ensure our employees were safe and following CDC guidelines while they kept the railroad running. We leverage our purchasing power to procure large quantities of safety supplies to stage around the network. Going forward we expect a run rate of $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the balance of the pandemic. I already mentioned the decline in the real estate gains in the second quarter. For modeling purposes our current assumption is for minimal sales activity across the balance of the year. We continue to see sales opportunities longer term while the team is also focused on accelerating strategies that will increase recurring income streams that are tied to our real estate portfolio. Fuel expense improved $143 million or 61% year-over-year driven by a 50% decrease in the per gallon price, lower volume and significant efficiency improvements. I probably sound like a broken record but we achieved another all-time record quarterly fuel efficiency at 0.96 gallons per GTM. Looking at other expenses. Depreciation increased $7 million or 2% in the quarter mainly driven by our 2019 equipment study. Equipment rents expense decreased $14 million or 15%. Lower volumes as well as improved cycle times and our intermodal market was the most significant driver. Turning below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Income tax expense decreased $123 million or 45% primarily resulting from lower pre-tax income. Absent unique items, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for future quarters. Closing out the P&L, CSX's operating income decline 37% year-over-year with a 63.3% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 13. On a year-to-date basis capital investment is roughly flat. We continue to invest in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure prioritizing investments that provide safe and reliable train operations. We are not cutting capital especially investments in the safety of our core infrastructure and projects that produce attractive returns. Through the second quarter free cash flow before dividends was $1.4 billion down 15% versus prior year. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Even in this challenging environment we saw free cash flow conversion on net income exceeded 100%. Our results this quarter really highlight the significant improvement in our operating model. Our ability to generate positive through cycle cash flow allows us to continue invest in our network and pursue incremental investments that will further strengthen our business. Importantly, our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the second quarter was $2.6 billion. This industry-leading cash and liquidity position provides us ample flexibility going forward and we remain committed to distributing excess cash to shareholders. With that let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJim Foote: Thanks a lot Kevin. Concluding on slide 15 we are we happy to see the volumes recover from the May trough as the economy strengthens. However, while these trends are encouraging the ultimate path of the recovery remains too wide to accurately predict at this point. As for CapEx we are still expecting the full year to be at the low end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. We will never reduce or defer any spend that impacts safety and we will continue investing to maintain the integrity of our network. We are, however, evaluating our capital spending programs to maximize efficiency and prioritize high return projects. We're applying the same discipline approach to our capital budget that we do to our operating expenses and making sure every dollar is spent productively while actively seeking out and eliminating wasteful spending. It's this mentality that has generated CSX's industry-leading cash flow profile and strong liquidity position. Not only does our transform cash flow profile provide additional operating flexibility during these periods of uncertainty but it allows us to continue investing for the health and growth of the business throughout the cycle. CSX is a better company today due to the actions taken over the past few months. No matter what path the recovery takes from here we will remain laser-focused on serving our customers and making this company stronger than it has ever been. I'm proud to work with such an exceptional team of railroaders and I'm more confident than ever that the best is yet to come for CSX. Thank you and I'll kick it back to Bill.\nBill Slater: Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to only one question. With that we will now open the line for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to see if you could offer some more thoughts on the structural changes to cost and how we might think of those? I guess the simple framework I think of is just kind of the schedule and what would your train schedule look like if the volumes came back to pre-COVID levels. I don't know if that's the right framework or if there are other things, just want to see if you can give more of a framework of the structural cost take out and how that looks when volume comes back. Thank you.\nJim Foote: So Tom, I think probably Jamie is -- probably the best, can give us a little bit of the color behind everything he's been working on so hard for the last three months.\nJamie Boychuk: I know absolutely. Thank you for the question Tom. As Jim mentioned and both Kevin we've seen a bit of a rebound obviously on our volume levels here over the past six weeks. We have being up 25% from our low point during the COVID period here and if you take a good look at that this business has come back with us only using 15% more locomotives and 14% more [real estate]. So we have, we use this time during COVID almost like our practice hour to be prepared on how to run trains differently, on how to really adjust our network. We're using more distributed power as Jim had mentioned in his opening. We are doing more of a train mix. Our auto network which practically disappeared throughout the COVID period has come back strong and we are moving it in a different way than we ever have. We are mixing the auto network with our manifest and in some areas with our intermodal network and reducing those train starts, road starts that we see out there is going to be a good lasting effect as we move forward. Are we going to have to continue to add some assets? Absolutely. It continues to improve and go above the pre-COVID volume. Definitely we'll be putting some assets back in and bringing some more people off furlough but I've always said that every asset we bring back in we'll learn it to keep and we're running the network we're starting to get our mojo back I guess with respect to our main line speeds where we hit 21 mile an hour here today which is a number that we're happy with. So we want to get that fluidity moving. And also in our yards we sees that won't come back. We have made sure that we've reduced the proper shifts in some of our diesel shops as well as move to work some of our Q type work which is some of our heavier semi-yearly work to certain facilities. It's working really well. We'll continue to do that which will continue to help us drive those savings and particularly on some of the areas of engineering. So if we take a look at not just this being the costs on the transportation side it's very successful in making sure that we get good work blocks out there. Our engineering team even though we're putting in still the same amount of ties and rail as we did last year we're doing it with $17,000 less per mile and we\u2019re doing it over $3 less per tie installed. So these are items that we're going to continue to move forward even as the volume continues to get back to pre-COVID levels and we feel quite confident that we're going to be able to absorb some of the cost or some of the volumes as it continues to come back.\nTom Wadewitz: Great, thank you.\nJim Foote: Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good afternoon. Jim, can you maybe talk about given the speed of the volume rebound that you're seeing and carloads now down only mid single digits. Thoughts on employees may be little bit more details on what you did with the restructuring there did you eliminate layers where there shift in operations and maybe the pace of return of some of those employees and then I guess in a bigger picture you're just thoughts on returning to possible operating ratio improvement as we get into the back half of the year. Thanks.\nJim Foote: That's a nice three question one question. I like your style. Yes. Again in terms of the structural changes that we made during the last couple of months here, I test the team with taking a look at everything that we do and seeing if there is a better way to do it. It wasn't just a exercise headcount reductions but it was an opportunity to see if during this more difficult period of time we could assess organization and figure out how we could eliminate layers and get things done more effectively and as a result of that we basically aligned in the areas where there probably should have been a long time ago and the organization is stronger and better performing as a result of that. Jamie, can offer a jump in little bit here more on calling back people -- more people in the field as we move forward. Our number one priority here is to make sure we deliver an excellent product to our customers. It would be when we saw that the dramatic yo-yo effect of our volumes over that six-week period there where everything just dropped off and then bounced back it's not an easy way to run a railroad and you've got all kinds of work rules etc. associated with how long it takes people to come back to work and so we're just now as Jamie said getting the railroad back up running with great fluidity and velocity. And now we will focus on getting back to what this team is now known for being exceptional operators and as we move forward in terms of the third part of your one part question the operating ratio is, it's an equation and we need to get the revenue stream back to where we expected it to be and we think based upon sequential increase week after week after week in the carload volumes which you see just like we do. Things are beginning, things are grinding their way forward and we hope that that continues and if that continues then we'll get back to where we think we should be which is showing everybody that we can run a railroad as efficiently and as lean as anyone else in North America. Jamie do you want to just, anything else that I missed?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. Just look at it when it comes to the headcount we make sure we have enough people. The most important part of that recipe really is working with Mark and his team ensuring that any customers who we get a heads up on who are starting to pick up on some of the traffic flow that we've got people where we need them and we start positioning people ahead of time as much as we can and we've brought in hundreds of T&E employees back. They're out there working for us on the front line moving the freight making sure that our customers get the service that they expect out of CSX but of course it's not easy as Jim mentioned in six weeks to go from your all-time low during this COVID period to a 25% volume increase and be able to pick it up is everything we said that we were going to be able to do at CSX and we've been able to accomplish that. So as more business at some point comes along again we work really, really close with our marketing team and we have got a good number of employees still on furlough that we want to find work for them and we'll continue to bring them back as we see the business level start to come.\nKen Hoexter: Great two-part thank you. So thanks for your time and thoughts. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess Jim or Mark can you give us some color on where you see the recovery coming right now? I think from our outside perspective it seems like a lot of consumer oriented freight markets are maybe rebounding a bit faster. Could you talk about that and maybe the dichotomy of what we're seeing on more core industrial trends or maybe that's not the right way to describe it right now.\nMark Wallace: Sure. So it's Mark. So thanks for the question Brandon. So interestingly over the course the last few months as our employees have been working from home and not spending time in airports and hotels and out there meeting with their accounts, we made it a key priority for our sales and marketing teams to remain close to our customers in order to sort of understand what they're seeing in the marketplace and how we could continue to service their needs and I think the general consensus throughout the quarter from customers has been that the outlook remains unclear. Having said that I think as Jim said earlier we and our customers are certainly have been pleased and encouraged to see the volumes recover off the trough from May but I still think it's too early to say that we have an accurate view on the trajectory of the volumes or the shape of the recovery in the second half. Now getting to your question I think in merchandise obviously encouraged to see auto plants reopen which has helped other markets like steel and plastics and auto parts for example interestingly even our [Oregon food] business during the quarter which traditionally is a pretty stable business in a recession was impacted given the declines in ethanol as nobody was driving into the office every day. Our beverage business was impacted given some of the shutdowns in Mexico and those supply chains were impacted and our feed grain shipments were low given also some food processors were running low capacity levels. All these markets now are starting to see some good volumes across the merchandise portfolio and we'll obviously continue to watch them very-very closely. I'll just also touch a little bit on intermodal. In April and May, they were obviously tough months for us both for domestic and international but we started to see volumes rebound nicely in June especially on the domestic side as the economy began to reopen and we saw inventories being replenished, some of the retailers and we also saw strong volume surges for our e-commerce business as individuals stayed home but shopped online. So that was encouraging. We think that strength will continue and we're encouraged with the international businesses as previously announced some of the blanks sailings have been reversed but there are customers direct quote from them they remain cautiously optimistic for the back half of the year. And then just rounding out the portfolio with coal, the outlook remains challenge both for domestic utility and for export. So as Jim said earlier, Brandon, virtually every one of our markets and customers were impacted by the pandemic. There remains a lot of uncertainty around the pace of the recovery and the continuing impact of COVID-19 on states and businesses, coupled that with what's going on with the upcoming election in November and other geopolitical issues that all shapes our view that while we're encouraged with the increases that we're seeing today we remain cautiously optimistic about the back half.\nBrandon Oglenski: Appreciate thorough response.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Allison Landry from Credit Suisse.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. Good afternoon. So just given that the wild swings in volumes, are you guys seeing any challenges or choke points as the traffic comes back whether your own network or with any of the interchange partners? It just seems like the service metrics have deteriorated across the industry recently. So just curious what you're seeing from a fluidity standpoint and if you think some of those clients we've seen recently are just temporary blips?\nJim Foote: Allison, it's Jim. I think I can't speak for the other industries but I can our experiences as like somewhat alluded to in my earlier answer, when we have that kind of really quick drop in and had to respond appropriately by reducing our workforce normally in a more traditional economic downturn scenario don't expect your employees they have to come back to work or don't expect them to come back to work so quickly. And in the normal scenario you're always worried, well Jesus these guys are all for 6, 8, 9, 12 months, are they going to be available for me to come back to work when the economy rebounds and I need to start recalling employees. So that was our principal concern working our way through this kind of maze and difficult period of time as to what is really going on here and so that was our concern was where are these guys going to be 12 months from now and I need to get him back to come back to work. Well, as we've now seen we had this short period of time and in that circumstance meaning we called people back. They have quite a lengthy time to actually return to work. When we call them and say okay business is back surprise, surprise then you come back to work tomorrow and the guy goes well, I got a couple of weeks here before I really got to markup and return and then there's a process to the seniority system where displacements occur. So it's just a work in progress for us to ramp up and get the trains fully staffed, so we can get our velocity back to where it needs to be our on-time our originations and arrivals where they need to be and that's taken us a little while and yes it shows in the metrics but we think that we are in a pretty good place right now and again I can't speak for the other railroads but I would imagine they have the same practically identical labor agreements that we do. They kind of probably struggled through this as well. And I just think now that everything is kind of smoothing out, we didn't see any kind of major congestion points throughout the North America like we sometimes do. So I think everybody's working very, very closely and effectively. There is a certain like mindedness now in the operating structure of the North American railroad where everybody kind of thinks the same way and acts the same way and as we said in the past the scheduled railroading model as it is implicated across North America is a good thing for the industry because we all know how to move trains now more effectively and efficiently than we put in the past.\nAllison Landry: Okay. Thanks so much. I mean it basically sounds like the takeaway is that you think this is mostly transitory. Is that fair to say?\nJim Foote: Yes. [indiscernible]I think we are in good shape right now.\nAllison Landry: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Hi, thanks. I had a very quick follow-up first Kevin you've been helpful in the past more recently in helping us think about OR in terms of a six handle etc. I wonder if you could do the same for the third quarter is another six handle kind of in the cars because of the volume declines or can we get back to the five handles given the revenue growth is much more, a decline is much more benign and then Jim you also talked about, I was hoping you could talk about the underlying growth initiatives that you guys have been working on pre-COVID. How they're tracking in terms of truck back to rail conversions? You obviously have a little bit more of a track record in terms of good trip plan compliance and truckload rates are taking up. So I was hoping you can give an update there as well. Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Yes. Amit, this is Kevin. I'm not going to give out any handles today. I thought it was appropriate last quarter but given where we are today and we're not guiding, I'll probably defer on that one. I will say as the volume comes off the bottom you're going to see a lot of operating leverage in the model. I'm very, very confident across all the expensive line items. If you look at it on a expense per GTM say we're going to see improvement across every area there and look as the volume come, if they come back stronger than what we anticipate that'll continue to improve the ORs. So we see, we just did [indiscernible] in the first quarter if anything our cost structure we've improved at this last quarter. So we pretty feel very confident once the volumes returned that we'll be back where we were.\nJim Foote: Yes and as in reference to your growth initiatives as Kevin just talked about as the volume of the business comes back and I just talked about the equation here being the operating rationale being revenues and expenses. It's only appropriate that we let Mark answer the question of how he plans to grow the business here in the next couple of weeks.\nMark Wallace : Jim thanks. So Amit, I think the journey continues on all our marketing efforts that we started these little less than a year ago now it seems like a long time but we haven't been at it that long but our clearly first priority at CSX was to fix the service product by and large mission accomplished there. I think we got the best service product going into this pandemic in the industry and we're very pleased with that and so, it allowed us to really focus on growing this company and really looking at all the marketing initiatives that we just haven't done in the past and the team's been hit hard at work looking all those things, peeling back the onion with our customers books of businesses, looking at opportunities, looking at business that maybe once was on CSX that has lost that had gone away over the years business that traditionally never moved by rail and moved by other modes of transportation, reaching out to those customers and explaining to them the value of CSX. I think part of the big benefit to as we've been going through this pandemic is as we talked to different shippers we offer a very competitive truck like solution and we're cheaper than the truck by and large. So in a time when companies are looking to save money during this pandemic, we become with our service a very interesting service option for them. So they continue that journey we're only 9 months or 10 months into this and we're very-very pleased with the lot of the progress that has been made across the portfolio, everything from metal and forest products and aggregates and a whole bunch of commodities where we've seen a lot of truck conversions happening and that as I said that journey continues and the work continues but so far our marketing team has done an outstanding job identifying a lot of those opportunities and we've got a great sales team that are actually going out and converting them.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Thanks very much Mark. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Hey thanks. Afternoon guys. So I don't know if this is for Kevin or Mark on the yield. So Radford car was down 7%, I think yields [indiscernible] fuel were down about 5%. Can you give us a sense of the price verse mix component in the quarter? And then I know mix as a tough one to forecast but directionally does mixing more or less negative in third quarter out to second and any thoughts Mark on the [indiscernible] with the benchmark grades if that goes down any further and any sort of help on the yield side? Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Lot of questions in one here today. Just kidding Scott. I'd be happy to answer those. I'm doing -- let me attack the pricing side comes to the heart of your question, I think and obviously this was a tough economic environment this past quarter but our pricing philosophy has not changed in terms of continuing to price the value of the service product which we think is really good. I was extremely happy in the quarter despite the tough environment that we were able to secure several significant longer-term deals with great pricing in the quarters. So the team is doing despite the environment the team is continuing to go out and get the price increases that we're looking for and I'm very-very pleased with the work they're doing. On the merchandise side, we saw positive pricing year-on-year. Inflationary plus pricing really good pricing area. Intermodal again increases year-on-year and then coal well, we can talk about that at another time but clearly a bit of a challenge especially when the export side and then on the domestic side as well. With respect to RPU Scott, I think the big story on RPU and the quarter was a fuel surcharge just given what happened with fuel in the quarter. If you look at our intermodal RPU was down 8%. If you exclude the impact of fuel surcharge that was about a 5% to 6% impact there. So we'd be down to 3% on intermodal for RPU and merchandise excluding the impact of fuel surcharge merchandise RPUs would actually be up. So a lot of mix issues as we've talked about. You and I and the rest of it everybody else always mix plays, ongoing impact in any given quarter just with the different RPUs and the different screens and the various commodity groups that we move. So we're always going to see that but clearly the big story this headline story this a quarter was the impact of fuel surcharge. So not going to give much guidance going forward but hopefully these things moderate here would hopefully that we will see a little bit less volatility on that side of the business going forward.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee from Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey thanks. Good afternoon. Kevin, you ran through I think a couple of cost that were it sounded a bit transitory from a second quarter perspective. I think severance costs around management restructuring which may actually go from I guess a negative in Q2 potentially a positive as we move forward. I think COVID steps down a little bit. Number one do you mind just kind of running through those again so we understand what sort of its some of the discrete moving parts are between 2Q and then 3Q maybe back half and then when your previous comment about sort of costs on a per GTM basis kind of improving sequentially as things volume comes off the bottom, would this be incremental to that? I just want to get a sense of maybe some of the magnitude there. I'm not sure it's a lot but I just want to make sure we understood it. \nKevin Boone: Yes. I'll go through a little bit of it. So I called out the $60 million in total on a year-over-year basis. Part of that was the COVID supplies which I called out around $10 million this quarter. Quite frankly we did everything cost. We prioritized speed over cost to get these supplies out to the field and protect the employees. So we experienced some pretty high costs on that. That will be coming down. We think it's about $2 million going forward on a run rate basis which I said in my opening comments. On the severance side we said that was about $10 million with about $25 million annualized savings related to that. We had some equipment impairments within the quarter call it mid single digit on the equipment impairments and then obviously real estate gains on a year-over-year comparison basis was down significantly about $26 million so and then I also called out depreciation was up this year following late 2019 equipment study that we went through essentially making the depreciation up year-over-year which obviously has a lot of different components within it but doesn't necessarily reflect the lower capital base that we have today. In terms of going forward there's a lot of things that we've done and I spoke to this a little bit a lot of other initiatives that we're working on currently that will have that you'll probably start to see show up in the third and fourth quarters and quite frankly in the 2021 take a bit of time. When I think about leases, buying those out, getting out of leases that we worked with Jamie very closely to identify that we don't need any more. Those take a bit of time to get out of and see the savings. The procurement team has done an amazing job working on with our suppliers. We're fortunate enough to be in a position today where we have we're strong balance sheet. Suppliers want to work with us. That provides leverage we're working on cost savings that have a longer tail that can hopefully have a multi-year savings behind them. So those things will start to show up which I'm very excited about. But there's, we have probably over a list of 30 different areas which we're going through that are non-labor related that we think they're great opportunities. Vehicle spend, utilities we've done a great job on the fuel sourcing side. We think there's big opportunities there over the longer term. We've gotten really, really efficient. We're doing a great there but we can source our fuel a lot better too and Jamie and his team are really helping us there think creatively on that side and then I also mentioned the management labor that will obviously have some impact in the following quarters and in the next year. So we're pretty excited about those and now that we can get through the quarter we have we're all going to meet again next week and go through the list and hopefully it continues to grow.\nChris Wetherbee: Great. Thanks very much for the color. Appreciate that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Jamie just want to ask about train size and weights as it applies to CSX maybe the Eastern network in general. We're hearing a lot of that from western and Canadian peers. I mean could you provide some context as to how much they grew sequentially as volumes fell if that was one of the levers you could pull and are there any upper limits to what the network might be able to handle either from an investment perspective or perhaps a physical with great crossings and do you think that's really a difference or perhaps a constraint when you look at some of the peers operating with a lot bigger train size and weights during this pandemic?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes Brian. We did see some good gains with both of our tonnage and length here in the past quarter hitting some records for ourselves pushing ourselves over 7% higher on our tonnage and around 4% on our length. We've only given a small piece of that back through the 25% of volume that we've seen. So we expect to see that continue forward and that is a, it is a big item that we talk about when we continue to design this network and we continue to look for those structural changes is that we'd like to continue to see our train length grow and depending on which quarter you're at, there's lots of opportunity on that end. So we're not going to give it all back. I can tell you that right now and we will continue to as I mentioned earlier with the auto network and how we were putting that together with our intermodal network and our merchandise network that gives us those opportunities to continue to grow our footage and our tonnage on our network and we have got a great network out there that has long sidings, that has double track, that is not an issue at all with respect to our network. We do have some grades in areas that may be more of a challenge in some areas but that's where distributed power comes in. And in some areas if we use a third locomotive instead of adding a train start and pushing a little more footage or tonnage we will continue to do that. Some other things, I guess to your second question somewhat, we have found some more opportunities on the network with respect to some quarters that we can do some small investments on which we are. I'd use an example of a trip that I was on a couple of weeks ago and Kevin joined me on that trip around the railroad. We found an area where we were back hauling cars millions of miles really back hauling automobiles that were coming off of St. Louis. I would have to go all the way up to Toledo to come down to Cincinnati because we had a subdivision in Indiana sub which was not cleared for autos. This past month our engineering team has done a fantastic job or I guess the past two weeks in clearing way for undercutting bridges and allowing the auto network to go direct now from St. Louis by Indianapolis down to Cincinnati again saving millions of auto route miles. So we continue to find those kind of opportunities out there. The more and more we get out on the network the more and more we work with the local people who are out there to ensure that we don't miss on these opportunities. Those are lasting structural changes that we will continue to see across our network.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Great. Thanks Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Ross from Stifel.\nDavid Ross: Yes, good afternoon gentlemen. I wanted to ask about the service levels in slide 10, both the trip plan performance and intermodal take down a little bit a little bit more on the intermodal side. Was there also a difference between that quarter average say on that 94% intermodal versus how it was the beginning of the quarter versus the end of the quarter? Is that 94 consistent or did it go from kind of a 96 to a 92 as you move through the quarter and volume came back and how does that relate to taking share back from truckload especially as rates are improving and the truckload side?\nJamie Boychuk: Well, I'll take it on the first part and I'll pass it over to Mark to talk a little bit about customer side but on our trip planned side that exactly what happened is your example we're towards the growth when we started to see this large pickup on our business when we went to this 25% increase in volume in six weeks, we definitely saw a little bit of our deterioration I guess really in some of our trip lines across the board. We're in a much better situation now but it is a enormous task to turn this big ship in six weeks to absorb that kind of volume. Operating team I would say has done an amazing job Marcelo Estrada who runs our intermodal business has done a great job making sure that trains that did arrive late to some of our ramps were offloaded faster by utilizing some of the assets we had at that end but to your point some of those percentages have dropped and we're starting to see that rebound come back but definitely very-very large volume swing.\nMark Wallace: Yes. I'd say just on the sort of truck conversions like there's good news bad news. Yes to Jamie's point we saw some of the quick time performance numbers fall below where I think we'd like to see them for intermodal and we were sort of 99% and again full visibility to our customers, we provided that last year in October. So they see exactly how we're performing to these trip plans. The depths of this crisis sort of in May volumes were down pretty substantially and so it wasn't too much of an issue and you're doing okay there so but as certainly as volumes have picked up since the trough in mid-May, the service levels have improved quite substantially and continue to prove every day. So as these volumes come back were our trip plan performance it's continuing to improve really nicely and so I think if you talk to our channel partners they would say that we were there for them even during the trough and we continue to be for them be there for them especially as these domestic volumes are rebounding and coming back.\nDavid Ross: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Long from Stephens.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. So I was wondering if you could talk about your active locomotive count. I am sure that's something that fluctuated throughout the quarter just given the volatility that you mentioned in volume. So can you just give us a sense on how that progressed over the course of 2Q and how you're thinking about the active locomotive count in the back half of the year? And then also along those lines would love to get your latest thoughts on the locomotive overhauls that you plan to do this year and longer term.\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. Absolutely. Look our locomotive fleet year-over-year Q2 was down over 650 locomotives. We have obviously brought back some of those locomotives. We were, we did hit some all-time lows down in the 1800 locomotives when we had a business decline that was pushing down towards 28%. Coming back to where we are now we're just into the above into the 2000s and we will continue to monitor that. We monitor it really daily when we look at a locomotive fleet. We have as Kevin mentioned over a thousand locomotives sitting in storage and we do have some locomotives that are ready to go in different areas. We position them properly. Now when we are very selective of what locomotives we put in storage. We made sure that we put down those that weren't, that were higher fuel burn that didn't give us the best performance and we tucked those really towards the back of the storage area as we continue to rebound and bring back some of the locomotives but that's where it's important that we continue to do a rebuild program. We believe in that rebuild program. We're finishing up what we committed to this year and next year as well, 30 plus locomotives that we're going to continue to rebuild into next year. I mean the fuel efficiency you get from those locomotives as well as the reliability. At CSX we found early on that we had a tired fleet and we needed to do something about it. We had well over 4,000 locomotives three years ago to where you see where our numbers are today and at CSX in the past we just continued to buy locomotives and just add them to the fleet and never retired anything. So we've taken the opportunity over the last three years to make sure we got the most efficient reliable locomotives out there and that's what we're pushing across the network now and particularly on the distributed power and that technology wasn't really utilized at CSX when we first got here and this team has done an unbelievable job wrapping arms around that and understanding the importance of that fleet and one last point with our locomotive fleet is we're very lucky that the majority of our fleet is AC locomotives which is more reliable. We've put down the majority of our DC locomotives. We did that a while ago and where we finished off changing out some of those to the AC fleet we had stored which allows us to pull more horsepower per locomotive and again that reliability.\nJustin Long: Great. Very helpful. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Kevin, you mentioned the elevated cash balance and you've been able to add to that board without really adding significant stats. So you're still very net debt we are getting in a good position there. started buybacks in June it looks like which is probably earlier than you had anticipated the last time you spoke to us in April. Can you just give us some cadence around how we should think about capital return in the second half of the year? Is the third quarter going to be maybe look like a measured pace like June or could we see a return to the type of buyback pace of prior?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I don't think we're sitting here thinking we're out of the woods yet. So I think the approach is going to continue to be very, very prudent. Jim and I talk about that a lot every week but also opportunistic at the same time. I mean clearly on a long-term, medium-term basis we don't need $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We need something well south of one billion to really run our business. So we have a lot of excess liquidity right now. Certainly makes me feel good at night to go to bed and have that cash balance just given all the uncertainty in the world today but we'll use it effectively over the next few quarters and talk closely with our board as well on the strategy around that.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Thanks Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, hi guys. Hey one thing I'm curious about on the wage inflation or said another way your cost per employee which I believe was down pretty sharply in the second quarter. I know there's moving parts with employees furloughed employees coming back but essentially could give how we should think about that part of the equation going forward?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. Look there was a few moving parts to that in the second quarter. One when you look at our headcount number it included 300 on the reserve boards on average through the quarter and obviously the cost related to those employees is lower than what you would see on average and we no longer have those reserve boards when you look into the third quarter. So you'll see some normalization there. Also I highlighted the incentive comp and that will also have an impact in the quarter as well and would expect that to normalize a bit here. Sequentially when you look at the headcount probably something more flattish into the third quarter on average, same average that you saw in the second quarter that I would expect the overall per employee cost to go up slightly here particularly what the mid-year union wage increase as well.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Bascome Majors from Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Hey Mark much earlier in the call you spoke about your efforts to reconvert some freight that the carload business had loss over the years and that some freight, that has always moved on trucking hasn't moved in the railroad. As the trucking market seems to be moving to an inflationary pricing backdrop pretty quickly here, can you take a step back and let us think about where you are in the sales cycle and some of these efforts that may have been disrupted by COVID and its impact on your business and your customers business and it just really did you size this up as a needle moving opportunity for CSX and investors over say a two-year timeframe? Thank you.\nMark Wallace: Yes. Thanks Bascome, listen I certainly hope so. I think as I said it's been this pause I would say has been sort of a refreshing time period for people from working at home to sort of step back and reevaluate things and where we are and what the priorities are and where we're focusing and look at opportunities opportunistically going forward and I think we are seeing the opportunity to look at a lot of those conversion opportunities and we know there's a huge market out there for us to protest to be able to go out and tap in and address that maybe just because for various reasons over the years CSX is ignored or just didn't want to move it or wasn't focused on those opportunities and I think as we are looking to grow and looking for opportunities with a better service product, a lower cost basis which opens up the opportunities for us to play in some markets that traditionally we couldn't before and to price them. I think maybe this is a sort of a defining moment here and we'll see. We are extremely excited by the opportunities going forward. Now you got to understand the environment we are in. We're in a very tough situation given the current economic environment with COVID-19 and the economy where it is but certainly regardless we're still seeing great opportunities and I think those opportunities will continue and when the economy does recover and industrial production does resume back at full strength and the consumer economy is back at full strength and businesses is roaring again, I think you will see those efforts pay off big-time.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good evening everyone. May be shifting gears and actually looking out a little bit. I don't know if you guys have paid much attention given everything going on but the Investment America Infrastructure bill that's kind of going through the house right now has a few kind of rail provisions in there. Some of which kind of it include things like mandating two-person crews and launching congressional investigations into kind of PSR and the impact of PSR or something. So just wanted to get kind of your thoughts on that if you spend any time with your folks in DC and then and maybe labor just your latest conversations on going to one-person crews and maybe kind of sizing the risk that if you do have some kind of political change in DC it could potentially kind of undo some of the gains you've seen on PSR over the years.\nJim Foote: Well, as soon as how it's a Washington question I think it's appropriate that I say I'll have to answer the question in a politically correct manner because I don't want to tell you what I really think of it. Everything comes out with a wish-list that's put forward by a well-known people with agendas and I don't know that politically billions and billions of dollars of capital investment over years and years and years on how to run the railroad appropriately and safely is going to be undone with some political mandate but we're certainly not focused on that but again I have been around a long time and there is I'm sure somewhere in some state house somebody's drafting up a bill right now to put the firemen back on the diesel locomotive. So we're aware of the situation. We follow all these developments in Washington and elsewhere but it's just a part of doing business but it's not something that distracts us.\nRavi Shanker: Makes sense Jim. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask a question on overtime. You referenced some substantial reductions there this quarter as you have in prior quarters. So was CSX pre-PSR organized in such a way that it was more reliant on overtime and what do you think the remaining opportunity is there and would you expect that to have a knock-on benefit on safety? Thanks.\nJamie Boychuk: I think the overtime we've mentioned I think over the past couple of quarters how important it was for us to get it in control which we have and we've hit out some great numbers across the board and it's also an area where we're able to use to flex as well. So even though I know Kevin threw out some numbers which were some very good percentages that we were able to drop, there are some areas as the business started to come back as fast as it did. We're able to flex ourselves and utilize a little bit of that pent up over time if you want to say by bringing it down. So is there more opportunity? Yes, absolutely there is on our engineering end. I know Ricky Johnson is working really hard with his engineering team to continue to bring down the costs particularly with the amount of time that they're getting out on the railroad to ensure that we're bringing those numbers down. On the mechanical side we've done an unbelievable job which Kevin had mentioned with respect to where our overtime is at and yes we'll continue to drive down those numbers but ultimately we'd like to get those overtime numbers down. So then when there's the time where we need it for a small surge we're able to utilize those employees on overtime if we get into an area where we need to do some hiring, we're able to use that as a bit of a bridge for us to get to that point. Overtime and safety, I don't really there's really a lot of correlation for me on overtime and safety. Safety is as Jim had started out the opening is for forefront for us. The number one most important piece of railroading and how we start all of our discussions around the railroad and we will continue to be.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much, good afternoon everyone. I wanted to focus on a little bit of the structural change that's been precipitated here by COVID-19 and really focus on two elements and love to hear your commentary on both. First of all is whether your capital intensity is something you're relooking at or you are reexamining. Mark you talked about getting into new areas you haven't been in before but are you looking as well to getting out of areas where you have been and that have been insignificant and structural decline particularly in coal, could we see some line divestiture that would come about as a result of significant decline in coal and the second part of this structural change is how well you and the railroads have done both in the global financial crisis and now this one whether you reexamine your capital structure and whether additional leverage is something that you could contemplate going forward given the consistency that you've been able to provide from a financial perspective through some of these very difficult times.\nJim Foote: Well, let me start maybe some of you guys want to jump in there with some brief comments. We're not in the, we don't have a railroad that's up for sale. We're very comfortable with our network. We are in the business right now of looking for business. We are open for business which [takes] every piece of business that we can get after. Our strategy is to grow this company. Maybe that wasn't the case when the cost structure was what it was before but based upon our levels of efficiency what we think we can do in the marketplace we're not interested in divesting and so our network is rock-solid. In terms of financial reengineering so to speak based upon what we've been through, I think for a company like CSX that has dramatically changed its financial profile and dramatically changed its cash flow, I think what was important to the rating agencies and others was to watch us work our way through various different in the economic scenarios and I don't think you could probably draw up a better stress test for a railroad to see how you're going to perform in difficult circumstances then what we were going through not only associated with the pandemic but what we've gone through before that with basically an industrial recession. So you take the industrial recession you throw in there the pandemic on top of that, you start figuring out what's going to transpire in the fall with the elections and all we do is keep kicking out cash day after day after day hour after hour. I think yes, that we have proven to the world that we had transformed this company into a very-very strong and stable financial company that and right now we have no obviously no reason to do that. Kevin just told that, we are having a hard time finding places to store the cash that if we decided that we wanted to level up further we've already said we've proven to the world that we have the capability in the world to do that. So I think it's a, I think again proof is in the pudding, people ask us what are you going to do two and a half years ago when we started on this adventure. This is what we told everybody we were going to do and now we again we've proven it.\nWalter Spracklin: Appreciate the color Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Vernon from Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Hey Jim or Kevin, I just wanted to hop on this issue of kind of [indiscernible] in relation to volume, it looks like and from the commentary earlier I sounded like we've just fallen below a watermark where it's too difficult to provide cost or it's happened too quickly. I'm trying to get a sense from what level of RTM do you think you need in the network to where profitability would be kind of stable on a year-over-year basis or is that not the right way to think about it?\nKevin Boone: Profitability stable from an OR perspective on year-over-year basis?\nDavid Vernon: Just in terms of like an EBIT level. So volume was down 21% or so operating profit 35% or so and clearly it sounds like there was some deleveraging some volume. What I'm trying to get at is how much volume do you need to get back and does it matter if it comes back as coal or intermodal or merchandise is just RTMs like is it 45 billion RTMs like what's the magic number where you feel like that de-leveraging doesn't happen?\nJim Foote: Yes, I mean I feel a lot better today where volumes are down mid-single digits versus the 20s that we're looking at. That's certainly helpful, so I think we're in a much better place right now and as I mentioned I think you're going to see some, you'll see across the board improvement on a cost per GTM level as we move in the third quarter assuming these volumes continue to recover from what we saw in the second quarter. So I'm very confident there and remind everyone it was just a quarter ago where we were traditionally what would be seasonally the worst quarter for us posted [58.7%] and I would I think we'd all agree here around the table today that all the things that we've done in the past three, four months have made us a better company and probably provided more leverage as the volume comes back. So I am more confident sitting here than I was when we reported in April that [58.7%] that we can really leverage it. It's just waiting on the economy to improve and going after it. So we've got a lot of initiatives that we'll continue to work on that'll hopefully continue to improve that.\nKevin Boone: To answer your other question an RTM is not an RTM, it's not an RTM. I mean that's just basic railroading, yes, we had a lot more coal in the first quarter than we had in the second quarter. We'll probably and then we'll have in the third quarter. So they're not all the same.\nDavid Vernon: Yes. I guess the is that going to create a little bit of an added headline here a coal stays weaker than or like how should we be thinking about the mix impact of where kind of volume fell out of the network?\nKevin Boone: It's only been going on at CSX for the last 10-15 years. So I mean, it shouldn't be a revelation that it's going to have an impact on the third quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Seidl from Cowen.\nJason Seidl: Thank you operator. Hey good afternoon gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit about peak season and how we should start thinking about it and what types of conversations you've had with some of your partners out there and also taking into account that July seems like it's going to be a stronger month than June which is seasonally a little bit different than historical averages. So would love to hear some commentary around that.\nJim Foote: Sure Jason. So typically we have really two peak seasons at CSX. We have sort of the labor day late, early September, late August peak season as you know kids are going back to school and we're seeing goods coming in from Asia and around the world, getting ready for all the fall activities. Halloween and Thanksgiving and all that kind of stuff and as people are going out and buying new goods for the back to school and all that kind of stuff so. I think clearly we've seen some good domestic intermodal volumes here over the last a couple of weeks as inventories have been replenished at some of the retailers. I think it's really wait and see if we see that sort of that bump up here call it around labor day. We'll see what happens with back to school. We'll see what if the states reopen, how the reopening process is, how the COVID cases are. So it's really in my view and our discussions with our customers are, we're cautious and we're watching it and it's I think you heard some of that from one of the channel partners who reported last week. It's a wait and see game. So we're there and we will be there and we'll have the crews and the locomotives and everything to be able to move that freight when if it does come and we'll see. So then the key, the other sort of traditional peak that we see is really around Thanksgiving or the e-commerce peak as people prepare for Christmas and order goods online. Again I think we'll probably see a peak, I think the peak may again depending on whether people are back at work, whether people are what the status of are the shopping malls open are people comfortable going to the shopping mall, if the COVID cases are still sort of concerning and people are cautious about venturing out then I think you may see that e-commerce type of peak a little bit sooner as people stay home and sort of order stuff on the web. So we'll see what happens but again as we said many times all this is really a wait and see period here for us as we move into the back half of the year.\nJason Seidl: I think that e-commerce peak has been happening since almost April at least in the societal household for sure?\nJim Foote: We have seen some good volumes on the e-commerce business. I mean clearly people are not venturing out and they're at home and they're ordering toilet paper and other things on the web. So our e-commerce peak and our volumes have been pretty strong in that area.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Well, I'll keep our fingers crossed for the outlook for after labor day then. Gentlemen appreciate the time.\nJim Foote: Absolutely.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ben Hartford from Baird. Ben Hartford your line is open.\nBen Hartford: Hey sorry about that. Thanks for getting me in here. Jamie, just wanted to get your quick take or clarify some comments made earlier about the safety performance. I think Jim had said that it was largely a function of lower volumes which makes sense in terms of the uptick in kind of the index whether it's personal injury rate or train accident rate but you're obviously undertaking some safety engagement initiatives as well, so what should we look at that as almost exclusively a function of lower volumes and so we're seeing incidences pop up on a per unit basis as a result of that or do you think that there was some slippage in safety performance on an absolute basis whether it was from service or some other factors that's leading to some of these initiatives that we're seeing in the third quarter.\nJamie Boychuk: Really, I think what Jim was mentioning more than anything was these are ratios. So if I take a look at the incidents that occurred they are decreased. There's less injuries. There's less accidents but it's based off of a per mile and/or per hour work. So as we had 1,000 plus employees really almost 1,300-1,400 employees at one point furloughed those hours disappear. So it creates a bit of a headwind when you take a look at how we do our FRA ratios and on the injury side we were at 0.86 which is still top line in the industry versus a 0.81 in 2019 and on the accident side we were at 2.19 this year versus a 2.47. So we did see an improvement on the accident side. It's the injury hours that are different but I mean look at that that said heading into the future, I think every railroads has got a little bit of a headwind with respect to engineers who went on the ground to work as conductors because they have seniority flow back rights. So they're doing jobs that they weren't used to doing. Retraining was something that we weren't able to do in most circumstances because of social distancing. So we were doing the best we could to provide distance training and/or working with the employees to ensure that they're obviously were qualified they were just doing jobs that they hadn't done for a number of years. So I think that's a headwind that we'll probably see across the entire industry but absolutely this past quarter the man hours that were removed from the furloughs is what would have affected our ratio.\nBen Hartford: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.\nJamie Boychuk: All right. Well great. Thank you so much for spending your some time with us this afternoon and we look forward to seeing you all in the near future and be safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today's call. you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Sure. So it's Mark. So thanks for the question Brandon. So interestingly over the course the last few months as our employees have been working from home and not spending time in airports and hotels and out there meeting with their accounts, we made it a key priority for our sales and marketing teams to remain close to our customers in order to sort of understand what they're seeing in the marketplace and how we could continue to service their needs and I think the general consensus throughout the quarter from customers has been that the outlook remains unclear. Having said that I think as Jim said earlier we and our customers are certainly have been pleased and encouraged to see the volumes recover off the trough from May but I still think it's too early to say that we have an accurate view on the trajectory of the volumes or the shape of the recovery in the second half. Now getting to your question I think in merchandise obviously encouraged to see auto plants reopen which has helped other markets like steel and plastics and auto parts for example interestingly even our [Oregon food] business during the quarter which traditionally is a pretty stable business in a recession was impacted given the declines in ethanol as nobody was driving into the office every day. Our beverage business was impacted given some of the shutdowns in Mexico and those supply chains were impacted and our feed grain shipments were low given also some food processors were running low capacity levels. All these markets now are starting to see some good volumes across the merchandise portfolio and we'll obviously continue to watch them very-very closely. I'll just also touch a little bit on intermodal. In April and May, they were obviously tough months for us both for domestic and international but we started to see volumes rebound nicely in June especially on the domestic side as the economy began to reopen and we saw inventories being replenished, some of the retailers and we also saw strong volume surges for our e-commerce business as individuals stayed home but shopped online. So that was encouraging. We think that strength will continue and we're encouraged with the international businesses as previously announced some of the blanks sailings have been reversed but there are customers direct quote from them they remain cautiously optimistic for the back half of the year. And then just rounding out the portfolio with coal, the outlook remains challenge both for domestic utility and for export. So as Jim said earlier, Brandon, virtually every one of our markets and customers were impacted by the pandemic. There remains a lot of uncertainty around the pace of the recovery and the continuing impact of COVID-19 on states and businesses, coupled that with what's going on with the upcoming election in November and other geopolitical issues that all shapes our view that while we're encouraged with the increases that we're seeing today we remain cautiously optimistic about the back half. Jim thanks. So Amit, I think the journey continues on all our marketing efforts that we started these little less than a year ago now it seems like a long time but we haven't been at it that long but our clearly first priority at CSX was to fix the service product by and large mission accomplished there. I think we got the best service product going into this pandemic in the industry and we're very pleased with that and so, it allowed us to really focus on growing this company and really looking at all the marketing initiatives that we just haven't done in the past and the team's been hit hard at work looking all those things, peeling back the onion with our customers books of businesses, looking at opportunities, looking at business that maybe once was on CSX that has lost that had gone away over the years business that traditionally never moved by rail and moved by other modes of transportation, reaching out to those customers and explaining to them the value of CSX. I think part of the big benefit to as we've been going through this pandemic is as we talked to different shippers we offer a very competitive truck like solution and we're cheaper than the truck by and large. So in a time when companies are looking to save money during this pandemic, we become with our service a very interesting service option for them. So they continue that journey we're only 9 months or 10 months into this and we're very-very pleased with the lot of the progress that has been made across the portfolio, everything from metal and forest products and aggregates and a whole bunch of commodities where we've seen a lot of truck conversions happening and that as I said that journey continues and the work continues but so far our marketing team has done an outstanding job identifying a lot of those opportunities and we've got a great sales team that are actually going out and converting them. Lot of questions in one here today. Just kidding Scott. I'd be happy to answer those. I'm doing -- let me attack the pricing side comes to the heart of your question, I think and obviously this was a tough economic environment this past quarter but our pricing philosophy has not changed in terms of continuing to price the value of the service product which we think is really good. I was extremely happy in the quarter despite the tough environment that we were able to secure several significant longer-term deals with great pricing in the quarters. So the team is doing despite the environment the team is continuing to go out and get the price increases that we're looking for and I'm very-very pleased with the work they're doing. On the merchandise side, we saw positive pricing year-on-year. Inflationary plus pricing really good pricing area. Intermodal again increases year-on-year and then coal well, we can talk about that at another time but clearly a bit of a challenge especially when the export side and then on the domestic side as well. With respect to RPU Scott, I think the big story on RPU and the quarter was a fuel surcharge just given what happened with fuel in the quarter. If you look at our intermodal RPU was down 8%. If you exclude the impact of fuel surcharge that was about a 5% to 6% impact there. So we'd be down to 3% on intermodal for RPU and merchandise excluding the impact of fuel surcharge merchandise RPUs would actually be up. So a lot of mix issues as we've talked about. You and I and the rest of it everybody else always mix plays, ongoing impact in any given quarter just with the different RPUs and the different screens and the various commodity groups that we move. So we're always going to see that but clearly the big story this headline story this a quarter was the impact of fuel surcharge. So not going to give much guidance going forward but hopefully these things moderate here would hopefully that we will see a little bit less volatility on that side of the business going forward. Yes. I'd say just on the sort of truck conversions like there's good news bad news. Yes to Jamie's point we saw some of the quick time performance numbers fall below where I think we'd like to see them for intermodal and we were sort of 99% and again full visibility to our customers, we provided that last year in October. So they see exactly how we're performing to these trip plans. The depths of this crisis sort of in May volumes were down pretty substantially and so it wasn't too much of an issue and you're doing okay there so but as certainly as volumes have picked up since the trough in mid-May, the service levels have improved quite substantially and continue to prove every day. So as these volumes come back were our trip plan performance it's continuing to improve really nicely and so I think if you talk to our channel partners they would say that we were there for them even during the trough and we continue to be for them be there for them especially as these domestic volumes are rebounding and coming back. Yes. Thanks Bascome, listen I certainly hope so. I think as I said it's been this pause I would say has been sort of a refreshing time period for people from working at home to sort of step back and reevaluate things and where we are and what the priorities are and where we're focusing and look at opportunities opportunistically going forward and I think we are seeing the opportunity to look at a lot of those conversion opportunities and we know there's a huge market out there for us to protest to be able to go out and tap in and address that maybe just because for various reasons over the years CSX is ignored or just didn't want to move it or wasn't focused on those opportunities and I think as we are looking to grow and looking for opportunities with a better service product, a lower cost basis which opens up the opportunities for us to play in some markets that traditionally we couldn't before and to price them. I think maybe this is a sort of a defining moment here and we'll see. We are extremely excited by the opportunities going forward. Now you got to understand the environment we are in. We're in a very tough situation given the current economic environment with COVID-19 and the economy where it is but certainly regardless we're still seeing great opportunities and I think those opportunities will continue and when the economy does recover and industrial production does resume back at full strength and the consumer economy is back at full strength and businesses is roaring again, I think you will see those efforts pay off big-time."

            "name": "Jim Foote",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you to everyone for joining our call this afternoon. Wow where do I start talking about this quarter. This was the most disrupted quarter I have experienced in my career with both the fastest decline in volumes followed by one of the most rapid increase in volumes in the company's history. Reacting to those extreme swings while dealing with the pandemic has been and continues to be challenging. CSX employees have been absolutely amazing in their response and I want to thank them for the hard work and dedication to keep the rail road running well. And I would be remiss if I didn't extend special recognition to our employees and their families who have fallen ill from the virus. Our thoughts are with them. In difficult times strong companies adapt and that's exactly what we have done. Despite all that has been accomplished to date and CSX's transformation we are still finding opportunities to be better, faster and more reliable. The actions taken over the past months will not only make CSX more efficient but more importantly they will allow us to be better delivering service to our customers in the future. Turning to the presentation, on slide 5 is an overview of our financial results which Kevin will discuss later. Due to the economic impact of the pandemic second quarter EPS declined 40% to $0.65 while the operating ratio increased to 63.3%. On slide 6 you could see that all business lines were negatively affected by the pandemic. Second quarter revenue declined by 26% year-over-year on 20% lower volumes. Sequentially the volume decline was the largest in CSX's history and almost twice as severe as any quarter during the 2009 recession. Merchandise revenue and volume declined 22% with the largest headwind coming from the automotive plant shutdowns. Automotive volumes declined 71% in the quarter including six consecutive weeks where volumes were down more than 90% each week. Intermodal revenue declined 18% on 11% lower volumes as both the international and domestic businesses were impacted by lower consumer and industrial demand. Coal revenue decreased 48% on 44% lower volumes. Both the domestic and export markets were negatively impacted by weak demand, from the combination of reduced power consumption, low natural gas prices and export benchmark prices. Other revenue declined 19 % due to lower affiliate revenue and declines in demerged charges and intermodal storage revenues. Turning to slide 7. Safety remains my top priority. Even though we had an all-time low number of train accidents in the quarter, the frequency rates for both train accidents and personal injuries increased due to the lower level of volumes. While CSX continues to lead the industry year-to-date in safety we must do better. We will never be satisfied with our performance if any of our employees get injured while at work and we are undertaking a comprehensive safety engagement initiative this quarter focused on strengthening critical rules compliance and systemically identifying and eliminating unsafe acts. Moving to slide 8, let's review our operating performance for the quarter. Despite the challenging operating environment the railroad continued to run at a high level. The operating team successfully implemented significant plan changes while maintaining fluidity and driving efficiencies across the railroad. In addition to these service design changes we also drove increased yard productivity setting a new record for cars handled per hour worked. Additionally, CSX continues to lead the U.S. class 1 railroads in fuel efficiency setting a new quarterly operating record of 0.96 gallons of fuel per thousand gross ton miles. Fuel efficiency along with ESG more broadly are priorities for our team. We are focused on leveraging the inherent benefits railroads have as the most sustainable mode of land-based transportation and are working hard to make sure CSX is building on these benefits to continue leading the industry in safety and sustainability. The topics of ESG and driving positive social impact are critically important to CSX, our customers and the communities we serve and we look forward to providing additional detail and key initiatives in our sustainability report to be released later this month. Slide 9 clearly highlights the unique operating challenges faced during the quarter. As volumes dropped more than 25% and then bounced back nearly 20% since Memorial Day. The team acted decisively to adjust the network for the changing volumes reducing total train starts roughly in line with volume declines and realizing line of road efficiencies even greater than the volume declines. These results reflect the strength of our operating model and the ingenuity of our team. In addition to consolidating trains across the network, they found new opportunities to integrate auto and unit trained business into the merchandise and intermodal networks as well as other unique service changes to be more efficiently leverage yard and local operations. When volumes began to recover late in the quarter we started recalling employees and added train starts to meet demand but we are confident that many of the changes we made during this period are durable and make CSX a stronger company. Slide 10 shows our hourly trip plan performance in the quarter. Car load trip plan performance of 80.5 was consistent with first quarter results and intermodal performance remained high at 94%. Volume has been volatile but we are working closely with our customers to ensure they are appropriately resourced and prepared to handle incremental volume when it comes. I will now turn over to Kevin for more detail on the quarter. Thanks a lot Kevin. Concluding on slide 15 we are we happy to see the volumes recover from the May trough as the economy strengthens. However, while these trends are encouraging the ultimate path of the recovery remains too wide to accurately predict at this point. As for CapEx we are still expecting the full year to be at the low end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. We will never reduce or defer any spend that impacts safety and we will continue investing to maintain the integrity of our network. We are, however, evaluating our capital spending programs to maximize efficiency and prioritize high return projects. We're applying the same discipline approach to our capital budget that we do to our operating expenses and making sure every dollar is spent productively while actively seeking out and eliminating wasteful spending. It's this mentality that has generated CSX's industry-leading cash flow profile and strong liquidity position. Not only does our transform cash flow profile provide additional operating flexibility during these periods of uncertainty but it allows us to continue investing for the health and growth of the business throughout the cycle. CSX is a better company today due to the actions taken over the past few months. No matter what path the recovery takes from here we will remain laser-focused on serving our customers and making this company stronger than it has ever been. I'm proud to work with such an exceptional team of railroaders and I'm more confident than ever that the best is yet to come for CSX. Thank you and I'll kick it back to Bill. So Tom, I think probably Jamie is -- probably the best, can give us a little bit of the color behind everything he's been working on so hard for the last three months. Thanks Jamie. That's a nice three question one question. I like your style. Yes. Again in terms of the structural changes that we made during the last couple of months here, I test the team with taking a look at everything that we do and seeing if there is a better way to do it. It wasn't just a exercise headcount reductions but it was an opportunity to see if during this more difficult period of time we could assess organization and figure out how we could eliminate layers and get things done more effectively and as a result of that we basically aligned in the areas where there probably should have been a long time ago and the organization is stronger and better performing as a result of that. Jamie, can offer a jump in little bit here more on calling back people -- more people in the field as we move forward. Our number one priority here is to make sure we deliver an excellent product to our customers. It would be when we saw that the dramatic yo-yo effect of our volumes over that six-week period there where everything just dropped off and then bounced back it's not an easy way to run a railroad and you've got all kinds of work rules etc. associated with how long it takes people to come back to work and so we're just now as Jamie said getting the railroad back up running with great fluidity and velocity. And now we will focus on getting back to what this team is now known for being exceptional operators and as we move forward in terms of the third part of your one part question the operating ratio is, it's an equation and we need to get the revenue stream back to where we expected it to be and we think based upon sequential increase week after week after week in the carload volumes which you see just like we do. Things are beginning, things are grinding their way forward and we hope that that continues and if that continues then we'll get back to where we think we should be which is showing everybody that we can run a railroad as efficiently and as lean as anyone else in North America. Jamie do you want to just, anything else that I missed? Allison, it's Jim. I think I can't speak for the other industries but I can our experiences as like somewhat alluded to in my earlier answer, when we have that kind of really quick drop in and had to respond appropriately by reducing our workforce normally in a more traditional economic downturn scenario don't expect your employees they have to come back to work or don't expect them to come back to work so quickly. And in the normal scenario you're always worried, well Jesus these guys are all for 6, 8, 9, 12 months, are they going to be available for me to come back to work when the economy rebounds and I need to start recalling employees. So that was our principal concern working our way through this kind of maze and difficult period of time as to what is really going on here and so that was our concern was where are these guys going to be 12 months from now and I need to get him back to come back to work. Well, as we've now seen we had this short period of time and in that circumstance meaning we called people back. They have quite a lengthy time to actually return to work. When we call them and say okay business is back surprise, surprise then you come back to work tomorrow and the guy goes well, I got a couple of weeks here before I really got to markup and return and then there's a process to the seniority system where displacements occur. So it's just a work in progress for us to ramp up and get the trains fully staffed, so we can get our velocity back to where it needs to be our on-time our originations and arrivals where they need to be and that's taken us a little while and yes it shows in the metrics but we think that we are in a pretty good place right now and again I can't speak for the other railroads but I would imagine they have the same practically identical labor agreements that we do. They kind of probably struggled through this as well. And I just think now that everything is kind of smoothing out, we didn't see any kind of major congestion points throughout the North America like we sometimes do. So I think everybody's working very, very closely and effectively. There is a certain like mindedness now in the operating structure of the North American railroad where everybody kind of thinks the same way and acts the same way and as we said in the past the scheduled railroading model as it is implicated across North America is a good thing for the industry because we all know how to move trains now more effectively and efficiently than we put in the past. Yes. [indiscernible]I think we are in good shape right now. Yes and as in reference to your growth initiatives as Kevin just talked about as the volume of the business comes back and I just talked about the equation here being the operating rationale being revenues and expenses. It's only appropriate that we let Mark answer the question of how he plans to grow the business here in the next couple of weeks. Well, as soon as how it's a Washington question I think it's appropriate that I say I'll have to answer the question in a politically correct manner because I don't want to tell you what I really think of it. Everything comes out with a wish-list that's put forward by a well-known people with agendas and I don't know that politically billions and billions of dollars of capital investment over years and years and years on how to run the railroad appropriately and safely is going to be undone with some political mandate but we're certainly not focused on that but again I have been around a long time and there is I'm sure somewhere in some state house somebody's drafting up a bill right now to put the firemen back on the diesel locomotive. So we're aware of the situation. We follow all these developments in Washington and elsewhere but it's just a part of doing business but it's not something that distracts us. Well, let me start maybe some of you guys want to jump in there with some brief comments. We're not in the, we don't have a railroad that's up for sale. We're very comfortable with our network. We are in the business right now of looking for business. We are open for business which [takes] every piece of business that we can get after. Our strategy is to grow this company. Maybe that wasn't the case when the cost structure was what it was before but based upon our levels of efficiency what we think we can do in the marketplace we're not interested in divesting and so our network is rock-solid. In terms of financial reengineering so to speak based upon what we've been through, I think for a company like CSX that has dramatically changed its financial profile and dramatically changed its cash flow, I think what was important to the rating agencies and others was to watch us work our way through various different in the economic scenarios and I don't think you could probably draw up a better stress test for a railroad to see how you're going to perform in difficult circumstances then what we were going through not only associated with the pandemic but what we've gone through before that with basically an industrial recession. So you take the industrial recession you throw in there the pandemic on top of that, you start figuring out what's going to transpire in the fall with the elections and all we do is keep kicking out cash day after day after day hour after hour. I think yes, that we have proven to the world that we had transformed this company into a very-very strong and stable financial company that and right now we have no obviously no reason to do that. Kevin just told that, we are having a hard time finding places to store the cash that if we decided that we wanted to level up further we've already said we've proven to the world that we have the capability in the world to do that. So I think it's a, I think again proof is in the pudding, people ask us what are you going to do two and a half years ago when we started on this adventure. This is what we told everybody we were going to do and now we again we've proven it. Yes, I mean I feel a lot better today where volumes are down mid-single digits versus the 20s that we're looking at. That's certainly helpful, so I think we're in a much better place right now and as I mentioned I think you're going to see some, you'll see across the board improvement on a cost per GTM level as we move in the third quarter assuming these volumes continue to recover from what we saw in the second quarter. So I'm very confident there and remind everyone it was just a quarter ago where we were traditionally what would be seasonally the worst quarter for us posted [58.7%] and I would I think we'd all agree here around the table today that all the things that we've done in the past three, four months have made us a better company and probably provided more leverage as the volume comes back. So I am more confident sitting here than I was when we reported in April that [58.7%] that we can really leverage it. It's just waiting on the economy to improve and going after it. So we've got a lot of initiatives that we'll continue to work on that'll hopefully continue to improve that. Sure Jason. So typically we have really two peak seasons at CSX. We have sort of the labor day late, early September, late August peak season as you know kids are going back to school and we're seeing goods coming in from Asia and around the world, getting ready for all the fall activities. Halloween and Thanksgiving and all that kind of stuff and as people are going out and buying new goods for the back to school and all that kind of stuff so. I think clearly we've seen some good domestic intermodal volumes here over the last a couple of weeks as inventories have been replenished at some of the retailers. I think it's really wait and see if we see that sort of that bump up here call it around labor day. We'll see what happens with back to school. We'll see what if the states reopen, how the reopening process is, how the COVID cases are. So it's really in my view and our discussions with our customers are, we're cautious and we're watching it and it's I think you heard some of that from one of the channel partners who reported last week. It's a wait and see game. So we're there and we will be there and we'll have the crews and the locomotives and everything to be able to move that freight when if it does come and we'll see. So then the key, the other sort of traditional peak that we see is really around Thanksgiving or the e-commerce peak as people prepare for Christmas and order goods online. Again I think we'll probably see a peak, I think the peak may again depending on whether people are back at work, whether people are what the status of are the shopping malls open are people comfortable going to the shopping mall, if the COVID cases are still sort of concerning and people are cautious about venturing out then I think you may see that e-commerce type of peak a little bit sooner as people stay home and sort of order stuff on the web. So we'll see what happens but again as we said many times all this is really a wait and see period here for us as we move into the back half of the year. We have seen some good volumes on the e-commerce business. I mean clearly people are not venturing out and they're at home and they're ordering toilet paper and other things on the web. So our e-commerce peak and our volumes have been pretty strong in that area. Absolutely."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you Jim and good afternoon everyone. The second quarter of 2020 represented the most significant revenue drop in the company's history. [indiscernible] with an $800 million revenue decline our company clearly responded. From a cost perspective our focus through this period was to accelerate initiatives that will deliver sustainable, structural cost reductions that position us to leverage growth as the economy recovers. As a leadership team we were deliberate in our strategy, focused on avoiding the pitfalls of making short-term cost decisions to the detriment of growing the business profitably as the economy rebounds from the pandemic. As you can see on slide 12 total expense was down 19% in the face of a 20% decline in volume. This includes the impact of approximately 60 million of unique headwinds we faced in the quarter which included lower real estate gains, severance costs related to a management restructuring, specific COVID-19 related costs, higher depreciation and property tax as well as equipment impairments in the quarter. Excluding these items costs would have been down 22% year-over-year. I frequently get asked a question especially over the last three months how much of your cost base is fixed versus variable and naturally everyone wants to hear how variable it is when volumes are declining and how fixed it is when volumes are on the rise. The reality is very little of our expense just falls out with lower volume. Action and a lot of hard work is required. It's a balance to ensure we variabilize the cost structure while maintaining service levels. In the second quarter we successfully identified creative solutions to help drive efficiency on a long-term basis. Some of these efforts will show up near term while others will benefit us in the quarters ahead. As volumes improve off the bottom I am confident you will see very strong operating leverage driven in part by a lot of the hard work and effort the team has put in over the last several months. Walking down the expense line items, Labor and fringe was 22 % lower reflecting the benefit of reduced crew starts, lower operating support costs and reduced labor at our terminals as well as dramatically lower overtime spending. Crew starts were down 24% exceeding volume declines in the quarter and saving over $70 million in total T&E labor expense. Additionally, the active locomotive count was down 25% year-over-year in the quarter, the smaller fleet combined with fewer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 20% reduction in the mechanical workforce while at the same time reducing mechanical overtime expense by 56%. We continue to remain extremely focused on overtime. The workforce efficiency and management execution we reduced over time across all operating departments by 50% versus the prior year driving $20 million of overtime savings in the second quarter alone. We also achieved significant largely sustainable reductions in our engineering contract labor expense and our intermodal terminal workforce. In addition to these efficiency improvements we had $39 million of lower incentive compensation expense in the quarter primarily reflecting lower projected payouts on existing plans. Finally, the quarter included $10 million of severance costs resulting from a management restructuring to align our resources and improve efficiency. From these actions we expect $25 million in ongoing annualized savings. As I've described before MS&O expense tends to be less volume variable than labor but we still reduce this line item by 9% in the second quarter or 14% when you adjust for the impact of $26 million and lower real estate and line sales gains versus last year. Continued improvement to the train plan combined with increased network fluidity enabled a 37% reduction in crew travel and repositioning expenses versus the prior year. On the mechanical side the active locomotive count was down 25% year-over-year. We closed the quarter with over 1,000 locomotives and storage. In addition, newer cars online and freight car repair efficiencies helped drive a 20% reduction in car material expense in the quarter. The safety of our employees remains CSX's number one priority. In the quarter we spend approximately $10 million in COVID related supplies to ensure our employees were safe and following CDC guidelines while they kept the railroad running. We leverage our purchasing power to procure large quantities of safety supplies to stage around the network. Going forward we expect a run rate of $1 million to $2 million per quarter for the balance of the pandemic. I already mentioned the decline in the real estate gains in the second quarter. For modeling purposes our current assumption is for minimal sales activity across the balance of the year. We continue to see sales opportunities longer term while the team is also focused on accelerating strategies that will increase recurring income streams that are tied to our real estate portfolio. Fuel expense improved $143 million or 61% year-over-year driven by a 50% decrease in the per gallon price, lower volume and significant efficiency improvements. I probably sound like a broken record but we achieved another all-time record quarterly fuel efficiency at 0.96 gallons per GTM. Looking at other expenses. Depreciation increased $7 million or 2% in the quarter mainly driven by our 2019 equipment study. Equipment rents expense decreased $14 million or 15%. Lower volumes as well as improved cycle times and our intermodal market was the most significant driver. Turning below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances partially offset by a lower weighted average coupon. Income tax expense decreased $123 million or 45% primarily resulting from lower pre-tax income. Absent unique items, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for future quarters. Closing out the P&L, CSX's operating income decline 37% year-over-year with a 63.3% operating ratio. Turning to the cash side of the equation on slide 13. On a year-to-date basis capital investment is roughly flat. We continue to invest in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure prioritizing investments that provide safe and reliable train operations. We are not cutting capital especially investments in the safety of our core infrastructure and projects that produce attractive returns. Through the second quarter free cash flow before dividends was $1.4 billion down 15% versus prior year. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team. Even in this challenging environment we saw free cash flow conversion on net income exceeded 100%. Our results this quarter really highlight the significant improvement in our operating model. Our ability to generate positive through cycle cash flow allows us to continue invest in our network and pursue incremental investments that will further strengthen our business. Importantly, our cash and short-term investment balance at the end of the second quarter was $2.6 billion. This industry-leading cash and liquidity position provides us ample flexibility going forward and we remain committed to distributing excess cash to shareholders. With that let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Yes. Amit, this is Kevin. I'm not going to give out any handles today. I thought it was appropriate last quarter but given where we are today and we're not guiding, I'll probably defer on that one. I will say as the volume comes off the bottom you're going to see a lot of operating leverage in the model. I'm very, very confident across all the expensive line items. If you look at it on a expense per GTM say we're going to see improvement across every area there and look as the volume come, if they come back stronger than what we anticipate that'll continue to improve the ORs. So we see, we just did [indiscernible] in the first quarter if anything our cost structure we've improved at this last quarter. So we pretty feel very confident once the volumes returned that we'll be back where we were. Yes. I'll go through a little bit of it. So I called out the $60 million in total on a year-over-year basis. Part of that was the COVID supplies which I called out around $10 million this quarter. Quite frankly we did everything cost. We prioritized speed over cost to get these supplies out to the field and protect the employees. So we experienced some pretty high costs on that. That will be coming down. We think it's about $2 million going forward on a run rate basis which I said in my opening comments. On the severance side we said that was about $10 million with about $25 million annualized savings related to that. We had some equipment impairments within the quarter call it mid single digit on the equipment impairments and then obviously real estate gains on a year-over-year comparison basis was down significantly about $26 million so and then I also called out depreciation was up this year following late 2019 equipment study that we went through essentially making the depreciation up year-over-year which obviously has a lot of different components within it but doesn't necessarily reflect the lower capital base that we have today. In terms of going forward there's a lot of things that we've done and I spoke to this a little bit a lot of other initiatives that we're working on currently that will have that you'll probably start to see show up in the third and fourth quarters and quite frankly in the 2021 take a bit of time. When I think about leases, buying those out, getting out of leases that we worked with Jamie very closely to identify that we don't need any more. Those take a bit of time to get out of and see the savings. The procurement team has done an amazing job working on with our suppliers. We're fortunate enough to be in a position today where we have we're strong balance sheet. Suppliers want to work with us. That provides leverage we're working on cost savings that have a longer tail that can hopefully have a multi-year savings behind them. So those things will start to show up which I'm very excited about. But there's, we have probably over a list of 30 different areas which we're going through that are non-labor related that we think they're great opportunities. Vehicle spend, utilities we've done a great job on the fuel sourcing side. We think there's big opportunities there over the longer term. We've gotten really, really efficient. We're doing a great there but we can source our fuel a lot better too and Jamie and his team are really helping us there think creatively on that side and then I also mentioned the management labor that will obviously have some impact in the following quarters and in the next year. So we're pretty excited about those and now that we can get through the quarter we have we're all going to meet again next week and go through the list and hopefully it continues to grow. Yes. I don't think we're sitting here thinking we're out of the woods yet. So I think the approach is going to continue to be very, very prudent. Jim and I talk about that a lot every week but also opportunistic at the same time. I mean clearly on a long-term, medium-term basis we don't need $2.6 billion of cash on our balance sheet. We need something well south of one billion to really run our business. So we have a lot of excess liquidity right now. Certainly makes me feel good at night to go to bed and have that cash balance just given all the uncertainty in the world today but we'll use it effectively over the next few quarters and talk closely with our board as well on the strategy around that. Profitability stable from an OR perspective on year-over-year basis? To answer your other question an RTM is not an RTM, it's not an RTM. I mean that's just basic railroading, yes, we had a lot more coal in the first quarter than we had in the second quarter. We'll probably and then we'll have in the third quarter. So they're not all the same. It's only been going on at CSX for the last 10-15 years. So I mean, it shouldn't be a revelation that it's going to have an impact on the third quarter."

            "name": "Jamie Boychuk",
            "content": "I know absolutely. Thank you for the question Tom. As Jim mentioned and both Kevin we've seen a bit of a rebound obviously on our volume levels here over the past six weeks. We have being up 25% from our low point during the COVID period here and if you take a good look at that this business has come back with us only using 15% more locomotives and 14% more [real estate]. So we have, we use this time during COVID almost like our practice hour to be prepared on how to run trains differently, on how to really adjust our network. We're using more distributed power as Jim had mentioned in his opening. We are doing more of a train mix. Our auto network which practically disappeared throughout the COVID period has come back strong and we are moving it in a different way than we ever have. We are mixing the auto network with our manifest and in some areas with our intermodal network and reducing those train starts, road starts that we see out there is going to be a good lasting effect as we move forward. Are we going to have to continue to add some assets? Absolutely. It continues to improve and go above the pre-COVID volume. Definitely we'll be putting some assets back in and bringing some more people off furlough but I've always said that every asset we bring back in we'll learn it to keep and we're running the network we're starting to get our mojo back I guess with respect to our main line speeds where we hit 21 mile an hour here today which is a number that we're happy with. So we want to get that fluidity moving. And also in our yards we sees that won't come back. We have made sure that we've reduced the proper shifts in some of our diesel shops as well as move to work some of our Q type work which is some of our heavier semi-yearly work to certain facilities. It's working really well. We'll continue to do that which will continue to help us drive those savings and particularly on some of the areas of engineering. So if we take a look at not just this being the costs on the transportation side it's very successful in making sure that we get good work blocks out there. Our engineering team even though we're putting in still the same amount of ties and rail as we did last year we're doing it with $17,000 less per mile and we're doing it over $3 less per tie installed. So these are items that we're going to continue to move forward even as the volume continues to get back to pre-COVID levels and we feel quite confident that we're going to be able to absorb some of the cost or some of the volumes as it continues to come back. Yes. Just look at it when it comes to the headcount we make sure we have enough people. The most important part of that recipe really is working with Mark and his team ensuring that any customers who we get a heads up on who are starting to pick up on some of the traffic flow that we've got people where we need them and we start positioning people ahead of time as much as we can and we've brought in hundreds of T&E employees back. They're out there working for us on the front line moving the freight making sure that our customers get the service that they expect out of CSX but of course it's not easy as Jim mentioned in six weeks to go from your all-time low during this COVID period to a 25% volume increase and be able to pick it up is everything we said that we were going to be able to do at CSX and we've been able to accomplish that. So as more business at some point comes along again we work really, really close with our marketing team and we have got a good number of employees still on furlough that we want to find work for them and we'll continue to bring them back as we see the business level start to come. Yes Brian. We did see some good gains with both of our tonnage and length here in the past quarter hitting some records for ourselves pushing ourselves over 7% higher on our tonnage and around 4% on our length. We've only given a small piece of that back through the 25% of volume that we've seen. So we expect to see that continue forward and that is a, it is a big item that we talk about when we continue to design this network and we continue to look for those structural changes is that we'd like to continue to see our train length grow and depending on which quarter you're at, there's lots of opportunity on that end. So we're not going to give it all back. I can tell you that right now and we will continue to as I mentioned earlier with the auto network and how we were putting that together with our intermodal network and our merchandise network that gives us those opportunities to continue to grow our footage and our tonnage on our network and we have got a great network out there that has long sidings, that has double track, that is not an issue at all with respect to our network. We do have some grades in areas that may be more of a challenge in some areas but that's where distributed power comes in. And in some areas if we use a third locomotive instead of adding a train start and pushing a little more footage or tonnage we will continue to do that. Some other things, I guess to your second question somewhat, we have found some more opportunities on the network with respect to some quarters that we can do some small investments on which we are. I'd use an example of a trip that I was on a couple of weeks ago and Kevin joined me on that trip around the railroad. We found an area where we were back hauling cars millions of miles really back hauling automobiles that were coming off of St. Louis. I would have to go all the way up to Toledo to come down to Cincinnati because we had a subdivision in Indiana sub which was not cleared for autos. This past month our engineering team has done a fantastic job or I guess the past two weeks in clearing way for undercutting bridges and allowing the auto network to go direct now from St. Louis by Indianapolis down to Cincinnati again saving millions of auto route miles. So we continue to find those kind of opportunities out there. The more and more we get out on the network the more and more we work with the local people who are out there to ensure that we don't miss on these opportunities. Those are lasting structural changes that we will continue to see across our network. Well, I'll take it on the first part and I'll pass it over to Mark to talk a little bit about customer side but on our trip planned side that exactly what happened is your example we're towards the growth when we started to see this large pickup on our business when we went to this 25% increase in volume in six weeks, we definitely saw a little bit of our deterioration I guess really in some of our trip lines across the board. We're in a much better situation now but it is a enormous task to turn this big ship in six weeks to absorb that kind of volume. Operating team I would say has done an amazing job Marcelo Estrada who runs our intermodal business has done a great job making sure that trains that did arrive late to some of our ramps were offloaded faster by utilizing some of the assets we had at that end but to your point some of those percentages have dropped and we're starting to see that rebound come back but definitely very-very large volume swing. Yes. Absolutely. Look our locomotive fleet year-over-year Q2 was down over 650 locomotives. We have obviously brought back some of those locomotives. We were, we did hit some all-time lows down in the 1800 locomotives when we had a business decline that was pushing down towards 28%. Coming back to where we are now we're just into the above into the 2000s and we will continue to monitor that. We monitor it really daily when we look at a locomotive fleet. We have as Kevin mentioned over a thousand locomotives sitting in storage and we do have some locomotives that are ready to go in different areas. We position them properly. Now when we are very selective of what locomotives we put in storage. We made sure that we put down those that weren't, that were higher fuel burn that didn't give us the best performance and we tucked those really towards the back of the storage area as we continue to rebound and bring back some of the locomotives but that's where it's important that we continue to do a rebuild program. We believe in that rebuild program. We're finishing up what we committed to this year and next year as well, 30 plus locomotives that we're going to continue to rebuild into next year. I mean the fuel efficiency you get from those locomotives as well as the reliability. At CSX we found early on that we had a tired fleet and we needed to do something about it. We had well over 4,000 locomotives three years ago to where you see where our numbers are today and at CSX in the past we just continued to buy locomotives and just add them to the fleet and never retired anything. So we've taken the opportunity over the last three years to make sure we got the most efficient reliable locomotives out there and that's what we're pushing across the network now and particularly on the distributed power and that technology wasn't really utilized at CSX when we first got here and this team has done an unbelievable job wrapping arms around that and understanding the importance of that fleet and one last point with our locomotive fleet is we're very lucky that the majority of our fleet is AC locomotives which is more reliable. We've put down the majority of our DC locomotives. We did that a while ago and where we finished off changing out some of those to the AC fleet we had stored which allows us to pull more horsepower per locomotive and again that reliability. Yes. Look there was a few moving parts to that in the second quarter. One when you look at our headcount number it included 300 on the reserve boards on average through the quarter and obviously the cost related to those employees is lower than what you would see on average and we no longer have those reserve boards when you look into the third quarter. So you'll see some normalization there. Also I highlighted the incentive comp and that will also have an impact in the quarter as well and would expect that to normalize a bit here. Sequentially when you look at the headcount probably something more flattish into the third quarter on average, same average that you saw in the second quarter that I would expect the overall per employee cost to go up slightly here particularly what the mid-year union wage increase as well. I think the overtime we've mentioned I think over the past couple of quarters how important it was for us to get it in control which we have and we've hit out some great numbers across the board and it's also an area where we're able to use to flex as well. So even though I know Kevin threw out some numbers which were some very good percentages that we were able to drop, there are some areas as the business started to come back as fast as it did. We're able to flex ourselves and utilize a little bit of that pent up over time if you want to say by bringing it down. So is there more opportunity? Yes, absolutely there is on our engineering end. I know Ricky Johnson is working really hard with his engineering team to continue to bring down the costs particularly with the amount of time that they're getting out on the railroad to ensure that we're bringing those numbers down. On the mechanical side we've done an unbelievable job which Kevin had mentioned with respect to where our overtime is at and yes we'll continue to drive down those numbers but ultimately we'd like to get those overtime numbers down. So then when there's the time where we need it for a small surge we're able to utilize those employees on overtime if we get into an area where we need to do some hiring, we're able to use that as a bit of a bridge for us to get to that point. Overtime and safety, I don't really there's really a lot of correlation for me on overtime and safety. Safety is as Jim had started out the opening is for forefront for us. The number one most important piece of railroading and how we start all of our discussions around the railroad and we will continue to be. Really, I think what Jim was mentioning more than anything was these are ratios. So if I take a look at the incidents that occurred they are decreased. There's less injuries. There's less accidents but it's based off of a per mile and/or per hour work. So as we had 1,000 plus employees really almost 1,300-1,400 employees at one point furloughed those hours disappear. So it creates a bit of a headwind when you take a look at how we do our FRA ratios and on the injury side we were at 0.86 which is still top line in the industry versus a 0.81 in 2019 and on the accident side we were at 2.19 this year versus a 2.47. So we did see an improvement on the accident side. It's the injury hours that are different but I mean look at that that said heading into the future, I think every railroads has got a little bit of a headwind with respect to engineers who went on the ground to work as conductors because they have seniority flow back rights. So they're doing jobs that they weren't used to doing. Retraining was something that we weren't able to do in most circumstances because of social distancing. So we were doing the best we could to provide distance training and/or working with the employees to ensure that they're obviously were qualified they were just doing jobs that they hadn't done for a number of years. So I think that's a headwind that we'll probably see across the entire industry but absolutely this past quarter the man hours that were removed from the furloughs is what would have affected our ratio. All right. Well great. Thank you so much for spending your some time with us this afternoon and we look forward to seeing you all in the near future and be safe."

During this call, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Following the presentation, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations for CSX Corporation.\nBill Slater: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mark Wallace, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\nJim Foote: Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining our call today. Before I get into the details of the first quarter, I want to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by the virus. No one ever imagined that we would be dealing with anything like this, but to see people everywhere respond to the challenge is uplifting. With the beginning of the transformation of CSX, just a few years ago, we adopted a few tenets by which to operate. First, be safe. The employee should never be injured while on the job. Second, help our customers be successful by providing them with good service. And third, operate as efficiently as possible. We knew that if we did those three things, we would be a great company and shareholders would be rewarded. We clearly did not change how we operate with a pandemic in mind. But because of the intense adoption of those core beliefs, CSX is now a much stronger and resilient company and in the best possible position to respond to this unprecedented and uncertain environment. I am incredibly proud of the men and women of CSX who are working on the front lines. They have once again showed what outstanding railroaders they are. CSX is running at peak condition, keeping the nation\u2019s supply chain moving and delivering critical products to millions of Americans. Thousands of customers trust CSX with their freight and every one of them right now is experiencing some degree of disruption. And we are deeply committed to maintain the best-in-class service they have come to expect from us. I am proud to say that service is currently the best it has ever been. Now let\u2019s go to Slide 5 of the presentation for highlights of the first quarter financial performance. First quarter EPS declined 2% to $1. While the operating ratio improved by 80 basis points to 58.7%, a new Class I railroad first quarter record. Given the combination of the known headwinds this year from export coal and other non-core items as well as the initial impact from the pandemic in the final weeks of the quarter, these results are impressive. Moving to Slide 6, first quarter revenues declined 5%, as merchandise growth was more than offset by declines in coal and other revenue. Merchandise revenue increased 3% on 2% higher volumes as broad-based volume growth across markets was partially offset by declines in automotive and fertilizers. Excluding automotive, merchandise revenue and volume were up 5% and 4% respectively. Intermodal revenue decline 1% on flat volumes as domestic revenue and volume growth was more than offset by declines in the international business. Excluding the COVID-19 impact from the final weeks of the quarter, international volume would have been positive as well. Coal revenues decreased 25% on 15% lower volumes. Both the domestic and export markets continue to be negatively impacted by natural gas prices, weak export demand and benchmark prices. Other revenue declined 40%, representing a 2% headwind to total revenue, due to lapping a favorable customer contract settlement last year and lower demurrage and intermodal storage revenues. Turning to Slide 7 and our safety performance where we again showed improvement. This quarter was one of the safest in CSX\u2019s history. The personal injury rate declined 22% and the train accident rate declined 34% with both figures approaching all-time company records. Let\u2019s now turn to Slide 8 and review our operating performance. CSX continued to operate at an extremely high level during what is typically the most seasonally difficult quarter, setting first quarter records for velocity, dwell and car miles per day. Additionally, CSX continues to lead U.S. Class I railroads in fuel efficiency, operating at 1 gallon of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles. Improving fuel efficiency is a top priority for the team and we are proud of our success. Fuel efficiency initiatives over the last several years have reduced annual diesel consumption by approximately 60 million gallons. The emissions avoided from this reduction are the equivalent of planting almost 1 million acres of forest each year, and we\u2019re challenging ourselves to be even better. CSX recently became the first U.S. Class I railroad to have its long-term emission intensity reduction goal approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative. Reducing emissions is important to us, our customers and the communities we serve. Critically as shown on Slide 9, our operating performance continues to drive best-in-class service and reliability for our customers. Trip plan performance is the best it has ever been with 84% of merchandise carloads and 98% of intermodal containers currently meeting their hourly trip plans in April so far. This performance includes the implementation of substantial service design changes in recent weeks to adjust our network and response to the current lower volumes. Let me turn it over now to Kevin for more detail on the quarter.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As you will see in my review of the first quarter financial results, CSX was once again able to drive significant efficiency gains, hosting yet another quality operating ratio record by the top line headwinds Jim described. This quarter marks three years since the transformation of CSX, and while there remains considerable uncertainty around the severity and duration of the economic impact related to the pandemic, CSX has never been in a stronger position to take this unique challenge. Our liquidity position is extremely strong with nearly $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of March. This represents the multiples of what we would consider normal targeted cash levels. You can also imagine we have run quite a few scenarios over the past several weeks. Every model we\u2019ve run has this substantial liquidity emerging in a stronger position from this downturn and leveraging the subsequent recovery. All of these scenarios will soon react and adapt our business to changing conditions, and we have already begun to quickly adjust to the current environment. From a financial perspective, we have taken many proactive steps to position the company to endure the economic downturn. First, we have ensured our cash position is liquid and available, shifting the majority of our cash investment to safer government funds for the time being. While we would like to be earning more on our cash we have taken a very conservative position until we are comfortable, conditions have normalized. We also raised an incremental $500 million of debt, taking advantage of what are historically low interest rates. But I look out over the next 36 months; we have less than $1 billion in debt maturities, which could easily be funded through our annual free cash flow. We continue to closely monitor our receivable balance and I\u2019m not seeing any significant change to our aging profile. Our transportation services remain critical to our customers and their ability to generate cash flow. Finally, while the current backdrop is challenging, we are realizing opportunities and efficiencies that we will be able to leverage when we return to growth. These environments provide an opportunity to evaluate every cost and challenge the way we do things, and I expect the savings to be durable when growth returns. Now turning my attention to Slide 11. I\u2019ll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 5% in the first quarter. A significant decline in coal, lower other revenue and unfavorable mix more than offset the benefits of merchandise gains. Moving to expenses, total operating expenses were 7% lower than first quarter, driven almost entirely by the strong gains in operating efficiency we once again delivered. Labor and fringe expense was 10% lower versus the first quarter of 2019, as the average employee count was down 1,600 or 7%. Notably, even with volume directly flat year-over-year in the first quarter, we continued to find opportunities to tighten the train plan. First quarter crew starts were down 11% versus the prior year. This is a year-over-year average for the quarter and reflects efficiency gains we made over the last 12 months. Starting in the second half of March and through April to-date, we have reacted to the declining volume environment and have continued to aggressively reduce train starts. I\u2019m sure Jamie will touch on this in the Q&A. I have also talked a lot about our focus on overtime the last few quarters, and once again, we saw a significant 33% reduction year-over-year. With current volume headwinds, we expect to continue to drive significant improvement and overtime spend. In addition to these gains and employee efficiency, we also had $14 million of lower incentive comp expense in the quarter. Finally, $10 million of other labor cost increases were primarily driven by the cycling of the railroad retirement tax refunds in the prior year. MS&O expense improved 4% versus the prior year. Continued efficiency improvements across the operating support departments, including significant reductions in engineering, contracted spend, terminal expense and crew travel, drove a $32 million reduction year-over-year in MS&O. While MS&O is traditionally less volume variables and labor costs; a month ago, we began to work to eliminate discretionary spending across the company, most of what will show up on this line item. Reductions in active locomotives and freight cars will also drive MS&O savings, and we expect outsourced terminal costs to adjust down as well. While MS&O will not be down one-for-one with volume, we are clearly focused on costs within this bucket that are traditionally less volume variable. Real estate and line sale gains of $18 million or $9 million lower in the quarter, while there continued to be a pipeline of these opportunities; sales activity is likely to be lower over the balance of the year given current economic conditions. That said, we have already closed one transaction in April and expect gains in the second quarter to be relatively flat with the first quarter. Fuel expense was $41 million favorable, an 18% improvement year-over-year driven by a 12% decrease in the per gallon price as well as significant efficiency improvement in lower volume. Our continued focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software combined with train handling rules compliance for the first quarter of record fuel efficiency. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $14 million or 4% in the quarter, which reflects a $10 million impact in the fourth quarter 2019 depreciation study, which will continue to impact year-over-year depreciation expense for the next two quarters. We still expect full-year depreciation to be up $50 million to $60 million. Equipment, rent expense, decreased 8%. Improved network performance has enabled faster car cycle times as measured by merchandise and intermodal days per load, which include 6% and 13% respectively. This combined with lower payable volumes with the majority of the savings and equipment rents. Going forward, we will see volume related reductions and equipment rent expense. So, these will be partially offset by lower car utilization. In addition, we expect lower equity earnings from our TTX affiliate, which also show up in equipment rents. Turning below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances, partially offset by a lower all-in coupon. The income tax expense increased $30 million as lower pre-tax earnings were more than offset by prior year benefits related to option exercises investing with other equity awards. Absent unique items, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for future quarters. Closing out the P&L. As Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX operating income declined 3% year-over-year, while the first quarter operating ratio of 58.7 representing an 80 basis point improvement. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 12. In the first quarter of 2020, capital investment was up slightly year-over-year. We continue to invest in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure and we continue to prioritize investments that provide safe and reliable train operations, but we are evaluating our capitals in total even during this downturn and volumes, our commitment to invest in the safety of our core infrastructure will not change. In the first quarter, free cash flow before dividends, that\u2019s $812 million, down slightly reflecting higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from property disposition. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team and we saw free cash flow conversion exceed 100%. The company continues to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder distribution including dividend payments. Importantly, I mentioned previously, our cash in short-term investment balance entering second quarter is nearly $2.5 billion. This position gives us confidence that combined with efficiency initiatives; we can not only weather the storm in front of us, but take advantage of opportunities that may present themselves to create long-term value for shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJim Foote: Great. Thank you, Kevin. Concluding on slide 14, due to the uncertain economic environment, and this should be of no surprise to anyone, we are withdrawing our guidance for the year. The potential range of outcomes for both production and demand, as well as the potential shape of the recovery are too wide to predict at this time. We are constantly assessing the economic situation and we\u2019ll respond like we always do by taking appropriate steps to control costs, but with an ever vigilant eye toward maintaining current, but most importantly, long-term service for our customers, we have worked too hard to get this right to go backwards. We are also evaluating our capital expenditure outlook for the year. Our first priority is and always will be the reliability and integrity of our railroad. We will not reduce or defer any spend that impacts safety. We will install about the same amount of rail and more balance this year than last. And Kevin and his team are looking for materials buying opportunities. We are however identifying potential areas of efficiency within our capital plan and the opportunities to defer some non-essential spend. The plan will be a fine as the year progresses, but currently, expect capital expenditures at the low end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. Importantly, CSX entered into this period with a dramatically different cash flow profile than at any point in the company\u2019s history. Over the course of our transformation, we have more than doubled CSX\u2019s free cash flow conversion and ended the quarter with almost $2.5 billion of cash in short-term investments and an untapped revolver. We will take the necessary steps to ensure sufficient liquidity. These are unprecedented times. I\u2019ve been through a lot in my career from Black Monday to the Great Recession and a lot of other unsettling events, but nothing like this. But I can say with certainty, long companies adapt, they make changes and they get even stronger. I hope this current situation is pet situation passes soon and we settle into the new normal. But for sure, the best is yet to come for CSX. Bill?\nBill Slater: Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. Also, we ask everyone to please bear with us as we work through the logistical challenges presented by joining today\u2019s call from different locations. With that, we will now take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: thanks, operator. thanks everybody for taking my questions and congrats on the cost performance in the quarter is pretty impressive. Kevin, I think it would just be really helpful to get some help on how we can think about decremental margins in the second quarter. We\u2019re obviously facing 20% plus volume declines, the 25%, 26% decremental as you guys achieved in the first quarter was great, but obviously, facing maybe, a more benign volume environment than what we\u2019re going to get in the second quarter. So, just any way to think about that and since I only get one question, if you can just also comment on how the pricing environment has evolved, if at all, in the context of the volume declines? Thanks a lot.\nKevin Boone: Yes, Amit. I think that qualifies as two, and I\u2019ll give you a pass, let me do the first one going today. look, I knew the decremental margin question would come up on this call and we talked about it a lot and I know you want to plug into your models, a certain decremental margin given your assumption here, I can give you a framework, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to lay out necessarily what the decremental margins could be, because there\u2019s a lot of different scenarios that could occur. What we\u2019re really focused on in this environment is taking out structural costs and really, on the other side of this really emerging and quite frankly, a better position to that maybe we would have had this not happen. So, but just going through the P&L here, obviously, the depreciation is a cost that\u2019s more something that in the near-term and medium-term is more difficult to go after. We\u2019ve done a great job on becoming more capital efficient that will work its way through depreciation over time. But that\u2019s something in the near-term that\u2019s obviously part of the move. When we look at our labor costs, as I described in the script, we obviously, with the great work, that Jamie and his team have done, eliminating train starts and other things, we\u2019re seeing headcount and reduced labor come out pretty significantly with the lower volume environment that we\u2019re seeing. MS&O as your experience will tell you, it includes a lot of different items. When I look across MS&O and how we look at it internally, traditionally, we\u2019ve said about 30% is highly variable, and then you have the rest of it, 25%, we\u2019ve generally said it\u2019s less \u2013 structurally less variable. But those are the things that we have to look at in this environment to really go after. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019re going to challenge ourselves. Clearly the rent expense from a car hire perspective shouldn\u2019t move the volume, but there are some offsetting relationships where we want to earn as much on our fleet, in terms of rents. And then the TTX relationship obviously creates somewhat of a less volume related upside that we will traditionally see. So there\u2019s a lot of pieces, we\u2019re not going to draw the line in the sand on what the decremental margins are. I can tell you what we have done is we\u2019re taking a review of everything. Our challenge here is to variabilize every cost we can, reevaluate it and the working conditions today, working from home and all of those, I think are introducing opportunities for more efficiency for us. So we\u2019re driving those, will react as a volume plays out here over the next quarter or two. And I think you\u2019ll see additional opportunities that will drive.\nMark Wallace: Maybe I\u2019ll take the second part of that first question. I think that was cheap but probably going to be a reoccurring theme throughout the afternoon here. The pricing story continues to be very strong. I think if you look at the RPU results, the RPU is a mixed story, not \u2013 and I\u2019ll repeat again, it\u2019s not a pricing story. Pricing continues to be very good. Same-store sales sequentially in year-over-year are very, very good and our negotiated contracts exceeded our same-store sales pricing. So the team is doing an exceptional job in these circumstances to extract good value for the transportation product that we are delivering to our customers, which is Jim and both and Kevin said continues to be outstanding. So I\u2019m very, very pleased the team has done a phenomenal job and has delivered great results on the pricing side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. Although, the question I\u2019m going to focus on here is the rate of decline that we\u2019re seeing in the second quarter. And Mark, maybe if you can speak to that, I mean, I think we show your volume down about 20% so far in April. Do you have any indications from customers when they plan to reopen sites or go back to higher levels of shipping or have we not even felt potentially the bottom of it yet?\nMark Wallace: Brandon, I would say, my crystal ball is probably as good as yours. In this uncertain environment things are so fluid. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re continuing to stay very, very close to our customers. I know the team while working remotely is staying very close to customers, reaching out to them on a weekly basis and trying to get a feel for their business, the impact to their business, how that affects the supply chain, what we can do to react. What I would say is these times are very uncertain and customers are seeing the same sort of things that we are. So we\u2019re doing what we can control and that\u2019s continuing to provide our customers with the best possible service and watching the volumes very closely. Jamie and I talk every day and sometimes way more than once and our teams do as well. And we\u2019re doing an exceptional job of staying on top of things, but I can tell you, once our customers reopen and things come back to normal, so to speak we\u2019re going to be there to provide exceptional service for them and be there for them when they get back. So there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty. As I said, clearly the automotive guys are down. We hear the public reports that those facilities, those plants will be open sometime in early May, around May 4. I think GM said today, they may push some of those plants back a week or two. But we\u2019re staying very, very close to them. We have weekly calls with all our customers and especially the automotive guys and we\u2019re just watching it and seeing what happens.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Allison Landry from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAllison Landry: Good afternoon. Thanks. So in past, you\u2019ve said that you still had many cost levers to pull as part of ongoing PSR implementation. So does the current downturn in volumes provided opportunity to speed up some of those remaining initiatives? So if you could speak to an acceleration of cost takeouts and also any other changes in the network that you might be able to pull forward that, would potentially put you guys in an even better position to benefit from a recovery sooner than you might have otherwise? Thank you.\nJim Foote: Thanks Allison. I\u2019ve talked many times about the difficulties associated with the decline on a gradual basis over the last 12 to 18 months associated with a stagnant industrial economy. And that we can respond quicker, when there are downturns. And the job that the team did in responding over the last four weeks in essence, not counting the international intermodal, let\u2019s start a little bit earlier, but over the last, a short period of time that responding to this quick downturn was nothing short of amazing. Jamie, why don\u2019t you talk about all of the steps that you guys took?\nJamie Boychuk: Sure, absolutely. We \u2013 obviously over the past few weeks here, we\u2019ve really started to adjust our network to what we\u2019re seeing as a current \u2013 the current environment and the way that demand sits. So we\u2019ve made a lot of changes out there where we\u2019ve reduced over the last couple of weeks, a number of our assets. But really we\u2019ve reduced our total road starts by 23% year-over-year against the 25% decline in volume. We stored over 400 locomotives since the end of March driving our active locomotive count under 2,000. To put that in perspective, three years ago when we started scheduled railroading at CSX, we had over 4,000 locomotives. We also held our merchandise train link consistent, yet we\u2019ve been able to eliminate over 500 merchandise trains from our daily plan, which has more than a 20% - sorry, 50 merchandise trains from our daily plan, which is more than a 20% reduction. While we\u2019ve been doing all that, we\u2019ve been able to reduce our train delays by over 66%. So I think it\u2019s really important to know that these changes are not just volume related that we started, really right off the start, ready for growth, working with Mark and his team while they were driving with customers. Now, we\u2019re really starting to pivot and use the current environment to go after structural opportunities in our operation. We will continue to adjust our network as demand dictates going forward, but we are also making changes where assets will not need to come back in the future. This is really an exercise for us to continue to work close with our marketing team, adjust our volumes and network each and every day. But at the same time, we are ready when volume returns to go after that volume and not leave a carload behind.\nAllison Landry: Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. Remarkable job on the cost side, very impressive how quickly you\u2019ve responded. Wanted to get your thoughts, Mark or Jim, just in terms of, how does the \u2013 I guess, I mean, when the markets moved so much, maybe it\u2019s irrelevant. But how do you interact with customers in terms of you\u2019ve got to cut costs and is the kind of share gain versus truck story, something you can kind of put on hold and say, we\u2019ll revisit it in another year? Or is it something that you kind of gauge the way \u2013 you manage the way you cut costs so that you still have that service and kind of dialogue from before. I mean, it seems like it\u2019s kind of an incremental question in a market that\u2019s big, very macro driven. But how do you think about that relative to the obvious success in cutting a lot of costs?\nJim Foote: Tom, as I said in my opening remarks, we have worked like dogs to get these service levels of this railroad up to where they belong and to win back credibility from our customers. And so we are \u2013 first of all and Mark can follow up on this, but Mark and Jamie, as Jamie said, are in constant communication with each other and making sure that our customers are aware of what service changes we need to make and what the impacts to our customers may be. And in many circumstances, the reason \u2013 again, the reason that we\u2019re reducing train starts is because their volumes are down and all we need to do is to have an honest dialog with our customers about the fact that we don\u2019t think we can serve them five days a week, how about three. And they go, sure, let me do, make the necessary adjustments, where it is appropriate. But Mark and his team are, as he said constantly communicating with the customers about that. Mark, why don\u2019t you follow up?\nMark Wallace: Yes, sure. Jim is exactly right. We\u2019re talking with our customers, clearly where they\u2019re seeing volume declined because their own businesses and their businesses are softer. And we have an opportunity to maybe take a day out of the service or whatever. We\u2019re having those conversations and we\u2019re staying close to Jamie and making those changes. Service is safe around here and our commitment to our customers is important. And we take that responsibility very, very importantly. And as Jim said, we\u2019ve worked really, really hard over the last three years to put in the reliability and the consistency of service that customers expect from us. We\u2019re doing that. We continue to do that and we\u2019re not going to \u2013 just because volumes are declining, we\u2019re not going to walk away from that strategy. And so we\u2019re continuing to work with everybody. And listen, I think the weekly carloads are showing that, I mean, we \u2013 with our better service and as I\u2019ve talked many times, we have repositioned our marketing teams to really get away from just being placing people to really understanding and doing real marketing work and looking for opportunities for us to gain share from other modes of transportation. And they\u2019re going to continue that, I\u2019m not sending them home for a year just because their volumes are down. They\u2019re going to continue to work. We\u2019re winning in the marketplace. We\u2019re uncovering opportunities with our better service products to win share from other modes of transportation, and I think you\u2019re seeing it in the carload. So we\u2019re having tremendous success there and that work\u2019s going to continue.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. You had a few comments on fuel efficiency. I wanted to circle back to that. I think going to the 2018 Investor Day, the thought was about 0.95%. It\u2019s probably the only target you didn\u2019t hit early from that outlook. So I just wanted to hear, can you still get to that number? It sounds like a lot of efficiency gains you\u2019re making now aren\u2019t necessarily volume dependent. So just wanted to see what were the main factors to drive that if that goal was still potentially on the table?\nJim Foote: Jamie, you want to take that?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes, absolutely. Look, fuel is something that we talk about consistently here at CSX. And everyone on our team, on the operating team knows clearly where our targets and our goals are with respect to that. We are using technology constantly to make sure that we hit those targets as we continue to break through new records each and every quarter as we move forward. We feel confident that we will continue to show the improvement that we have in the past and we\u2019ll continue to move that forward. Definitely as our \u2013 as we fill out our trains, we make our trains bigger and longer that helps with the efficiency, where two locomotives are pulling more freight than they were before as we consolidate trains and as we continue to move forward into volume growth at some point in time when the market conditions change. But, yes, it\u2019s an important key factor. I\u2019ve got an unbelievable operating team who is working on this. We have created our own small department of a few individuals who are solely concentrating on fuel efficiency and those people will continue to do what they\u2019re doing and driving the metrics to where we\u2019re seeing them.\nJim Foote: I guess we\u2019ll take an A minus on one of our \u2013 one of the categories.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right, thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon. Hope all is well and safe. And Jim, you\u2019ve always provided good insight into kind of the calling the volume outlook. Maybe just talk a bit about, more about keeping the costs around if you anticipate a quick bounce back, given the speed of the decline compared to suffering with some higher costs in the near term. And I guess I\u2019m more specifically referring to employees and how you think about furloughing or cutting additional employees with the ability to get them back up and running quickly.\nJim Foote: Well, Ken, that has been the number one area of concentration for me for the last month is trying to deal with not only making sure that we have the employees ready, willing and able when as this business turns around, but to make sure because of the tragic circumstances both with the disease and the economic fallout at the same time to make sure that we were very humanitarian in the way we\u2019ve approached things. We have been working diligently with the labor unions from day one and have come up with some unique arrangements to address those concerns recognizing the fact that the future is clearly unknown in terms of how long this is going to last. And so we\u2019ve done a lot of interesting and unique things in conjunction with labor, especially in the early days to keep the employees working and then to be able to pivot, to adjust in a manner when volumes really began to decline, but to make sure we have access to those employees when things turn back. So we have been thinking way outside the box to try and come up with ideas wherever we can. And right now I feel we\u2019re as in a good position as one could be in that circumstance. I wish I had a crystal ball in terms of future volumes, but right now we just don\u2019t have that.\nKen Hoexter: So, I guess just to clarify\u2026\nJamie Boychuk: Just on some of the points that Jim kind of put out there was we have \u2013 with our union groups we have set up some agreements that will allow our employees to go on what we call a retention board. It\u2019s their choice \u2013 sorry, it\u2019s a reserve board. It\u2019s their choice to get on that board or not. Most of our employees, a large number of them have decided to go on to that board, instead of taking furlough on the T&E side. And the benefits for us, and of course these are tough decisions that we\u2019re making as we continue to work on this downturn and control our costs, but the benefits is a less carrying cost for us, but it allows the employees to have medical benefits and other benefits along the way. That gives us, in most cases, a 48-hour recall for when the volume starts to come back, we don\u2019t have to wait the normal period which is around a 15-day recall cycle. We\u2019re able to jump on volumes as Mark and his team work on as the economic conditions change.\nKen Hoexter: Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Jamie. Appreciate the insight.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe a question on intermodal and I guess maybe two pieces to it. I guess, first, when you think about sort of the customer mix and what you guys are moving both on the international and the domestic side, is there any sense that you can give us to sort of what is maybe more consumer and sort of essential type businesses that could be operating kind of what the floor might be like in that? And then, secondarily, in times of disruption like this, do you tend to see modal shift occur? Obviously, truck spot rates have gone down quite a bit here, but that typically isn\u2019t the sort of measure that you guys tell us to look to in terms of how to think about share between truck and rail, it\u2019s more contractual. So just want to get a sense of maybe how that kind of plays out when you\u2019re in a very disrupted state like we\u2019re in right now.\nJim Foote: Mark?\nMark Wallace: Sure. Thanks. So when we started off the quarter, modal was doing quite well. We had the traditional Chinese New Year on the international side, where volumes were reduced significantly. And then because of COVID-19, the outbreak in China, with the extended shutdowns, we sort of saw a pause on the international front for quite some time. Meanwhile, the domestic side of the business was doing actually pretty well. I think as people saw what was happening, here was a lot of inventory being moved out of the warehouses and positioned to stores in anticipation of the increased demand and so we saw that dynamic. And then China opened up a little bit later in the quarter. We saw some international volumes come in, and then meanwhile, the domestic side of the business was slowing down considerably. So right now, as we look out, a lot of reports out there about the demand equation and clearly with a lot of the shutdowns, the retail businesses are closed, there\u2019s not a lot of demand for things. And so with a lot of price ceiling on the international front and we expect that our domestic intermodal business will slow down considerably and is slowing down considerably now and for the foreseeable future. So those are sort of the dynamic shifts that have been going on. Service is tremendous. Our on-time performance is in the high 90s; 98%, 99%. We\u2019re seeing \u2013 so as it pertains to truck, the trucking environment was tight and then it loosened up quite significantly and it\u2019s pretty fluid now. So we have to continue doing what we\u2019re doing, providing great service to our customers. Clearly, competition from the trucks. There\u2019s a lot of trucks out there and we\u2019re going to compete harder and try to win some business, but that\u2019s kind of the environment right now.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That\u2019s a very helpful color. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys.\nJim Foote: Hey, Scott.\nScott Group: So Kevin, last quarter you talked about some specific headwinds. I think it was $300 million or so in coal revenue, $90 million lower gains, $50 million in the other railway revenue. I don\u2019t know if those are so impacted by what\u2019s going on. So maybe just a comment if you think any of those have materially changed. And then, Mark, for you just quickly, have we seen the full impact of the benchmarks in coal RPU or is there one more leg down to come here?\nKevin Boone: Yes, I\u2019ll cover a few of those headwinds. I think on the previous call I mentioned real estate sales, last year was about $160 million. We\u2019ve guided for this full year of $50 million. Based on my comments we\u2019ll probably see something a little bit south of that $60 million. The market is fluid right now. We obviously feel sequentially the number will be in line with the first quarter. Fourth quarter is probably a little bit more uncertain depending on the marketing condition that exists today. We\u2019re certainly not going to buy or sell anything and we have plenty of cash and we\u2019re going to maximize value, of course. And then on the depreciation as I described, $50 million to $60 million headwind primarily related to the group life study. There is obviously non-cash, but it\u2019s impacting the income statement on that side. From a culture cycle, I\u2019ll let Mark talk a little bit more about that, but I don\u2019t think in aggregate that that headwind has changed and the market is probably somewhat similar, but I\u2019ll let Mark touch on that.\nMark Wallace: Yes. No, thanks, Kevin. Scott, yes, I would say, I don\u2019t know. I would say the benchmarks are sort of all over the place. I think from what we told you in Q4 in January, I think from a benchmark perspective, we\u2019re still sort of thinking the same thing quarterly, a little bit of weakness on API to prices, a little bit less of a factor now because a lot of coal is going to Europe. But most of our coal \u2013 lot of our coals, especially on the thermal side, is going to India. India is closed down for a month. When that reopens, anybody\u2019s guess. So, no coal is going to India right now. So, those dynamics are happening. The net benchmark came up a little bit, those are re-priced quarterly. So, clearly as Jim said, in his opening, coals have some headwinds. We didn\u2019t foresee any of these coal dynamics, when we were talking to you in January, the markets have changed dramatically. So, there\u2019s clearly some headwinds out there and benchmarks are one, but the demand is clearly, the driving force here.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Ross from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nDavid Ross: Yes. good afternoon, gentlemen. And maybe, this is a question for Jamie. You talked about mix specifically, are there any commodity types that you hauled that either help or hurt overall network productivity that might be harder to handle or sort of the network for some reason? For example, if auto is not around, is that a good thing or is there any other commodity type that might limit network efficiency?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. Look at \u2013 on the operating end of things, of course, we\u2019ve really only got three different types of commodity. Our type of trains, I guess we would say. So, you\u2019ve got our bulk service, which is easier, lower costs in most circumstances in cases. And then we have our merchandise, which is usually handled multiple times throughout a network, by the time, it gets from online or from customer to customer. With respect to the auto side of the business, I would say that it is \u2013 it\u2019s heavily on our network. It\u2019s very customer-based with respect to a lot of work done at the loading facilities and unloading facilities. So, there are a number of yards and locals, and we do have some dedicated auto trains that run in certain parts of the network. So, when it comes to cutting off auto, even though it\u2019s a revenue that we don\u2019t want to lose and it\u2019s a good revenue for us. There\u2019s, you can pull out a lot of costs with respect to auto when the auto network shuts down the way it did.\nDavid Ross: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yes, just a quick question. Obviously, most of the volume environment\u2019s pretty tough right now, but as some buffer comes from agriculture, agricultural products, is that something that might actually not look that bad in the grand scheme of things? Thanks.\nJim Foote: Well, it\u2019s certainly, freight commodities got a little different cycle to it. I think we\u2019re looking at, as an example, a reasonably good movement of fertilizer now, because that\u2019s the time of the year to do that. And I think everybody\u2019s still planning on planting a crop this year. And then in all the various buckets, a lot of them, again, as you said, agricultural, it has its own cycle based upon its commodity. It\u2019s not tied to auto production as an example.\nJordan Alliger: So there is, as you said, a different cycle than the rest of the industrial, so maybe, there could be some hope on that volume product?\nJim Foote: Yes, there\u2019s \u2013 certainly, yes. Certainly each element has its own drivers so to speak. And auto as an example has \u2013 is one thing that impacts a lot of different groups within the industrial and merchandise segment. And but yes, there are certain elements. I mean there\u2019s been a still be some coal is going to move. Like I said, fertilizer\u2019s going to move, grains going to get harvested. We\u2019ve always relied on that grains in one straight shape or another to keep the railroads going, whether it\u2019s corn, wheat, or beer.\nJordan Alliger: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. So, one of the noticeable trends year-to-date has been the outperformance of your volumes versus your eastern rail competitor. So, I was wondering if you could comment on how much of that outperformance in your opinion is coming as a function of market share gains from that rail competitor, market share gains from truck and mix. And maybe, as you answer that question, you could also address the lower fuel price environment and how you\u2019re thinking about the modal share impact from that going forward as well. Thanks.\nJim Foote: Mark?\nMark Wallace: Sorry, I was doing something else, I apologize. We are seeing share, a good share gains across the portfolio. What\u2019s our strategy when we started this thing was to put in place the best service product that we could. We\u2019re doing that we continue to do that. Next, we are focused on the sales and marketing organization is really focused on three things. Number one, because of the superior service that we have working with our existing customers to expand the amount of rail they use. Number two, work with customers to use to have \u2013 used to move freight with CSX, but for some reason over the last couple years, have pursued various reasons might have gone away. We\u2019re working hard with those customers to bring that story back home I would say. And the third strategy is working with shippers, who may have traditionally never used rail in the past, but have always looked at trucking easier to do business with and never were really wanted to consider rail as an option, because of the work that we\u2019re doing to make it easier to do business with, because of our cost profile, we\u2019re able to go into some of those markets now that our marketing team is identifying and looking at enabled and being able to win share there. For instance, we\u2019ve been very successful in one segment in the business of aggregates. Aggregates continue to be a very strong commodity for us these days. There\u2019s a lot of road construction projects that are going on. Traditionally, a lot of that coming out of like from Georgia into middle of about Florida. And less than 300 miles used to move by truck, because we had the capacity, because we had the service, we\u2019re able to play in those markets and make a very good return by doing so. And the contribution on that is very good. So, we\u2019re very \u2013 so, we\u2019re looking at all these different buckets of opportunities. The teams are being very aggressive. And I think as you said in your question, you can see it in the results you see on a weekly basis.\nJim Foote: Justin, on your comment about the dynamics between the rail versus truck in the impact that lower fuel prices might have. Where\u2019s the \u2013 that\u2019s one of the reasons why we continue to work so hard to make sure we reduce our fuel efficiency is, so that we can be more competitive with the highway. But there have been a number of a recent independent surveys that are out there right now, where they ask customers you\u2019re still planning \u2013 what do you think about rail transportation. is it reliable? yes. It\u2019s fantastic, yes. Or you like leadership probably a little bit more than I was in the past? Is there still value to shipping rail versus truck? Well, maybe it\u2019s not 15%, when oil is negative 35%. But they still stay at 10%, 10% cheaper with the same truck like service is extremely compelling in the marketplace.\nJustin Long: Great. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate the responses.\nJim Foote: Right, Justin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon. Kevin, question for you on the balance sheet side, you\u2019ve got about $2 billion of the cash, obviously, ample liquidity, the cash flow position and business is good. Are you guys going to get back to a more aggressive capital return through buyback or are you thinking about changing in a way you\u2019re going to be returning some of that capital to investors emphasizing more of the dividend and any changing thoughts on that the capital return profile going forward?\nKevin Boone: Yes, it\u2019s a \u2013 clearly, it\u2019s a dynamic market right now. We\u2019re very happy and to have $2.5 billion of cash and balance sheet and growing every day, I was still generating positive free cash flows. So that\u2019s clearly, we look over the medium term and even long-term, that\u2019s not a cash balance that we are going to need on the balance sheet. And we still feel distributing this to our shareholders is something that we\u2019ll prioritize going forward when the buybacks will continue for you to discuss that over the next few months. But I would expect that at some point for that to be still a core component of our cash returns to shareholders. I mentioned on the opening remarks that we\u2019re committed to our dividend. It\u2019s something that we re-evaluate every year. We just recently this year increased that. And so we\u2019ll see what we do next year. but again, we\u2019re generating significant free cash flow even in these marketing conditions and we can cover that dividend as we continue to be committed to the shareholder returns.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you. Maybe, if I can tweak one quick follow-up in. Jim, or is there anything on the policy side you\u2019re looking at coming out of DC that would be beneficial or game-changing beyond obviously, the economy just restarting, anything in infrastructure spending or stuff like that that we should be keeping an eye on that would have an outside impact on CSX?\nJim Foote: Nothing that is game changing. We\u2019re clearly interested in any cause of financial stimulus that would involve infrastructure, because that would be a benefit to us. But no, so far to-date, the government in terms of providing flexibility to the rail industry, to be able to operate and maintain all of the safety requirements, especially with the ad hoc nature of the way some of this was implemented in the States. We have not really been implemented \u2013 impacted and the government\u2019s been very cooperative with us.\nDavid Vernon: All right. thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon everyone. I guess, if we were to look out beyond COVID-19 and understanding that there\u2019s the world in the future is not going to be \u2013 we\u2019re not going back to normal and there could be some opportunities that emerge in that new normal, Jim. When you look at how the world might develop post COVID-19, how it\u2019s structurally different, is there anything that a railroad or CSX in particular can do to capitalize on a new normal that is just different from the way things operated before? And if I could lead the witness for a second. The retail focus on e-commerce and the higher costs that are contained in that strategy of e-commerce is a new strategy. Can you benefit in that e-commerce either, because the retailers are also looking to offset that with a lower cost rail option? Or can you somehow play a role in the e-commerce chain in a way that you didn\u2019t, that you didn\u2019t before?\nJim Foote: Well, yes. there are two benefits \u2013 well, not call it benefits, I shouldn\u2019t use that word there. There are two opportunities for us that may arise as things evolve. First is, I think and this is just my own personal thoughts. I think that there will be more manufacturing that takes place in this country and any kind of business activity like that. It\u2019s good for the railroad. Secondly, we now can compete with a truck in the markets as they become more and more large quantity shippers that fit well into the rail dynamics, because of our service. So, with our service product that we had before and because of the disparate network the way product moved, it was difficult for the railroads to compete in e-commerce arena. I think that as we go forward, that will be a big opportunity for us.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Jason Seidl from Cowen. Your line is open. Jason, your line is open. please admit yourself.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Hey, Jim and team, hope you guys are doing well. It seems like we\u2019re going to be coming out of this pandemic on a state-by-state basis. So, it\u2019s going to be a little bit choppy and disparate. What kind of challenges is that going to present to CSX and the network?\nJim Foote: Probably, the same kind of challenges that we experienced in the past when I talked about a slow decline is harder to manage than a complete shut off. It was easier for us as to adjust as we described when the auto industry just completely shut down in a week. My guess is the auto industry won\u2019t completely start up in a week. And so we will be challenged as the traditional logistics chain is not the same. And so we\u2019ll have to \u2013 we\u2019ll have to evolve, we\u2019ll have to work with our customers and it will present more of a challenge for us. I don\u2019t see the fact that one state might come back online in certain areas two weeks before somebody else does. Texas starting out before Pennsylvania is not that big of a deal. It\u2019s the industry that will start up across the country based on the comfort level of the population as the States come back.\nJason Seidl: Yes. that makes sense. And is this where sort of that flexibility with your headcount is going to really come into play and help you out?\nJim Foote: Yes. that\u2019s why, again, we\u2019re trying to anticipate you may be heard a lot of people talking about planning, modeling, thinking, what do we do, new norms, et cetera, listen, we spent \u2013 have spent and continue to spend a lot of times brainstorming about what could happen and how are we going to be in a position to respond.\nJason Seidl: Sounds good. Listen, everyone, be safe out there.\nJim Foote: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Jim, in your closing comments, you mentioned some of the prior periods of destruction that you\u2019ve been through and obviously, each one\u2019s different. But you\u2019re former employer, you, Jamie and Mark, all arguably had the best performance both operationally and financially during probably the closest thing to what we\u2019re dealing with now in 2008 or 2009. What are some of the similarities that you see to this environment back to 2008 or 2009, and some lessons that you can bring from that period that\u2019ll help you out to proactively to get the system right-sized get still without disrupting the service?\nJim Foote: Well, I think 2008-2009 again, we saw not this sudden shutdown, but we saw clearly, a dramatic and shutdown. And as a result, we looked back to those days to see \u2013 yes, because I wasn\u2019t at CSX and pretty much none of us were here to see what the traffic declines were, what the traffic pattern declines were. And it was helpful for us to try and to understand what it\u2019s like when 20% of your business goes away in two weeks. So, lessons learned from all of those things, I hate to age myself, but yes, I\u2019ve been through just about every modern day a financial calamity plus, like I said, all those in my career, but this one is clearly the most challenging.\nJon Chappell: Are you implementing similar operational thing that you did north of the border 12 years ago? Or is it a completely different response given the network and like geographic exposure?\nJim Foote: No, it\u2019s again, there\u2019s no magic to the geography, there\u2019s magic to people. And the mindset of the people here in terms of making decisions, being quick, being nimble and getting things done all while looking forward and not getting a tunnel vision is the same. We have a phenomenal team that recognizes what needs to get done and we work together and we execute. Just the way we did it before. I mean, that was, it was just good people there too.\nJon Chappell: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne from TD Securities. Please go ahead.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much and good afternoon. So clearly, we\u2019re in uncharted territory here and you\u2019ve talked a lot about how you\u2019re staying close to your customers, but I wonder if you could just talk a bit about how you\u2019re collaborating with your interchange partners to prepare for various downturn and recovery scenarios?\nJim Foote: Well, you know, it\u2019s a network business. What happens to one of us happens to all of us. It wasn\u2019t that just the auto plant shutdown on CSX; they shut down across the country. We work together on a constant basis managing the fleet as it moves across the network, open lines of communication, good coordination, making sure that we don\u2019t get the a lot of equipment is stuck in one terminal that could begin to slow down the network. And I think over the last couple of years, you\u2019ve heard that many of us say most of the operating people now at the various railroad all think alike. We\u2019re all kind of working off the same page in terms of moving assets and running the network to the maximum level of efficiency and that\u2019s been extremely helpful, the coordination and understanding has been extremely helpful.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you. That\u2019s my one.\nJim Foote: All right.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, Jim or Kevin, if I can just follow-up in the last response, obviously, completely understandable that you pull your guidance given the variety of kind of the spread of uncertainty out there. But I\u2019m sure you guys have planned for multiple scenarios that can play out in the next two or three quarters. So, can you share kind of some of the, like the bull-bear base case scenario open of what volumes look like and 2Q, 3Q, 4Q, kind of as part of our planning samples?\nJim Foote: Well, yes, we\u2019ve certainly \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly looked at all of the alphabets the V, the U, the L, and what I use that W as possible recovery scenarios. And obviously, the volumes in each one of those numbers is significantly different. So, as a result, because there is such a huge difference between that, that\u2019s why at this point in time, maybe, give me another 30 days, we\u2019ll have a better vision as to what the real startup plan for the auto is, what\u2019s going on with steel, what\u2019s going on with X, Y, and Z. Other than that, it\u2019s just a hypothetical exercise and that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t want to try to guess at this point in time. And so I apologize, but we\u2019re just not going to give you some kind of numbers like that.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. Thanks.\nJim Foote: Yes, Ravi.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mark Wallace",
            "content": "Maybe I'll take the second part of that first question. I think that was cheap but probably going to be a reoccurring theme throughout the afternoon here. The pricing story continues to be very strong. I think if you look at the RPU results, the RPU is a mixed story, not \u2013 and I'll repeat again, it's not a pricing story. Pricing continues to be very good. Same-store sales sequentially in year-over-year are very, very good and our negotiated contracts exceeded our same-store sales pricing. So the team is doing an exceptional job in these circumstances to extract good value for the transportation product that we are delivering to our customers, which is Jim and both and Kevin said continues to be outstanding. So I'm very, very pleased the team has done a phenomenal job and has delivered great results on the pricing side. Brandon, I would say, my crystal ball is probably as good as yours. In this uncertain environment things are so fluid. What we're doing is we're continuing to stay very, very close to our customers. I know the team while working remotely is staying very close to customers, reaching out to them on a weekly basis and trying to get a feel for their business, the impact to their business, how that affects the supply chain, what we can do to react. What I would say is these times are very uncertain and customers are seeing the same sort of things that we are. So we're doing what we can control and that's continuing to provide our customers with the best possible service and watching the volumes very closely. Jamie and I talk every day and sometimes way more than once and our teams do as well. And we're doing an exceptional job of staying on top of things, but I can tell you, once our customers reopen and things come back to normal, so to speak we're going to be there to provide exceptional service for them and be there for them when they get back. So there's a lot of uncertainty. As I said, clearly the automotive guys are down. We hear the public reports that those facilities, those plants will be open sometime in early May, around May 4. I think GM said today, they may push some of those plants back a week or two. But we're staying very, very close to them. We have weekly calls with all our customers and especially the automotive guys and we're just watching it and seeing what happens. Yes, sure. Jim is exactly right. We're talking with our customers, clearly where they're seeing volume declined because their own businesses and their businesses are softer. And we have an opportunity to maybe take a day out of the service or whatever. We're having those conversations and we're staying close to Jamie and making those changes. Service is safe around here and our commitment to our customers is important. And we take that responsibility very, very importantly. And as Jim said, we've worked really, really hard over the last three years to put in the reliability and the consistency of service that customers expect from us. We're doing that. We continue to do that and we're not going to \u2013 just because volumes are declining, we're not going to walk away from that strategy. And so we're continuing to work with everybody. And listen, I think the weekly carloads are showing that, I mean, we \u2013 with our better service and as I've talked many times, we have repositioned our marketing teams to really get away from just being placing people to really understanding and doing real marketing work and looking for opportunities for us to gain share from other modes of transportation. And they're going to continue that, I'm not sending them home for a year just because their volumes are down. They're going to continue to work. We're winning in the marketplace. We're uncovering opportunities with our better service products to win share from other modes of transportation, and I think you're seeing it in the carload. So we're having tremendous success there and that work's going to continue. Sure. Thanks. So when we started off the quarter, modal was doing quite well. We had the traditional Chinese New Year on the international side, where volumes were reduced significantly. And then because of COVID-19, the outbreak in China, with the extended shutdowns, we sort of saw a pause on the international front for quite some time. Meanwhile, the domestic side of the business was doing actually pretty well. I think as people saw what was happening, here was a lot of inventory being moved out of the warehouses and positioned to stores in anticipation of the increased demand and so we saw that dynamic. And then China opened up a little bit later in the quarter. We saw some international volumes come in, and then meanwhile, the domestic side of the business was slowing down considerably. So right now, as we look out, a lot of reports out there about the demand equation and clearly with a lot of the shutdowns, the retail businesses are closed, there's not a lot of demand for things. And so with a lot of price ceiling on the international front and we expect that our domestic intermodal business will slow down considerably and is slowing down considerably now and for the foreseeable future. So those are sort of the dynamic shifts that have been going on. Service is tremendous. Our on-time performance is in the high 90s; 98%, 99%. We're seeing \u2013 so as it pertains to truck, the trucking environment was tight and then it loosened up quite significantly and it's pretty fluid now. So we have to continue doing what we're doing, providing great service to our customers. Clearly, competition from the trucks. There's a lot of trucks out there and we're going to compete harder and try to win some business, but that's kind of the environment right now. Yes. No, thanks, Kevin. Scott, yes, I would say, I don't know. I would say the benchmarks are sort of all over the place. I think from what we told you in Q4 in January, I think from a benchmark perspective, we're still sort of thinking the same thing quarterly, a little bit of weakness on API to prices, a little bit less of a factor now because a lot of coal is going to Europe. But most of our coal \u2013 lot of our coals, especially on the thermal side, is going to India. India is closed down for a month. When that reopens, anybody's guess. So, no coal is going to India right now. So, those dynamics are happening. The net benchmark came up a little bit, those are re-priced quarterly. So, clearly as Jim said, in his opening, coals have some headwinds. We didn't foresee any of these coal dynamics, when we were talking to you in January, the markets have changed dramatically. So, there's clearly some headwinds out there and benchmarks are one, but the demand is clearly, the driving force here. Sorry, I was doing something else, I apologize. We are seeing share, a good share gains across the portfolio. What's our strategy when we started this thing was to put in place the best service product that we could. We're doing that we continue to do that. Next, we are focused on the sales and marketing organization is really focused on three things. Number one, because of the superior service that we have working with our existing customers to expand the amount of rail they use. Number two, work with customers to use to have \u2013 used to move freight with CSX, but for some reason over the last couple years, have pursued various reasons might have gone away. We're working hard with those customers to bring that story back home I would say. And the third strategy is working with shippers, who may have traditionally never used rail in the past, but have always looked at trucking easier to do business with and never were really wanted to consider rail as an option, because of the work that we're doing to make it easier to do business with, because of our cost profile, we're able to go into some of those markets now that our marketing team is identifying and looking at enabled and being able to win share there. For instance, we've been very successful in one segment in the business of aggregates. Aggregates continue to be a very strong commodity for us these days. There's a lot of road construction projects that are going on. Traditionally, a lot of that coming out of like from Georgia into middle of about Florida. And less than 300 miles used to move by truck, because we had the capacity, because we had the service, we're able to play in those markets and make a very good return by doing so. And the contribution on that is very good. So, we're very \u2013 so, we're looking at all these different buckets of opportunities. The teams are being very aggressive. And I think as you said in your question, you can see it in the results you see on a weekly basis."

            "name": "Jim Foote",
            "content": "Thanks, Bill, and thank you all for joining our call today. Before I get into the details of the first quarter, I want to say that our thoughts are with those who have been affected by the virus. No one ever imagined that we would be dealing with anything like this, but to see people everywhere respond to the challenge is uplifting. With the beginning of the transformation of CSX, just a few years ago, we adopted a few tenets by which to operate. First, be safe. The employee should never be injured while on the job. Second, help our customers be successful by providing them with good service. And third, operate as efficiently as possible. We knew that if we did those three things, we would be a great company and shareholders would be rewarded. We clearly did not change how we operate with a pandemic in mind. But because of the intense adoption of those core beliefs, CSX is now a much stronger and resilient company and in the best possible position to respond to this unprecedented and uncertain environment. I am incredibly proud of the men and women of CSX who are working on the front lines. They have once again showed what outstanding railroaders they are. CSX is running at peak condition, keeping the nation's supply chain moving and delivering critical products to millions of Americans. Thousands of customers trust CSX with their freight and every one of them right now is experiencing some degree of disruption. And we are deeply committed to maintain the best-in-class service they have come to expect from us. I am proud to say that service is currently the best it has ever been. Now let's go to Slide 5 of the presentation for highlights of the first quarter financial performance. First quarter EPS declined 2% to $1. While the operating ratio improved by 80 basis points to 58.7%, a new Class I railroad first quarter record. Given the combination of the known headwinds this year from export coal and other non-core items as well as the initial impact from the pandemic in the final weeks of the quarter, these results are impressive. Moving to Slide 6, first quarter revenues declined 5%, as merchandise growth was more than offset by declines in coal and other revenue. Merchandise revenue increased 3% on 2% higher volumes as broad-based volume growth across markets was partially offset by declines in automotive and fertilizers. Excluding automotive, merchandise revenue and volume were up 5% and 4% respectively. Intermodal revenue decline 1% on flat volumes as domestic revenue and volume growth was more than offset by declines in the international business. Excluding the COVID-19 impact from the final weeks of the quarter, international volume would have been positive as well. Coal revenues decreased 25% on 15% lower volumes. Both the domestic and export markets continue to be negatively impacted by natural gas prices, weak export demand and benchmark prices. Other revenue declined 40%, representing a 2% headwind to total revenue, due to lapping a favorable customer contract settlement last year and lower demurrage and intermodal storage revenues. Turning to Slide 7 and our safety performance where we again showed improvement. This quarter was one of the safest in CSX's history. The personal injury rate declined 22% and the train accident rate declined 34% with both figures approaching all-time company records. Let's now turn to Slide 8 and review our operating performance. CSX continued to operate at an extremely high level during what is typically the most seasonally difficult quarter, setting first quarter records for velocity, dwell and car miles per day. Additionally, CSX continues to lead U.S. Class I railroads in fuel efficiency, operating at 1 gallon of fuel per 1,000 gross ton miles. Improving fuel efficiency is a top priority for the team and we are proud of our success. Fuel efficiency initiatives over the last several years have reduced annual diesel consumption by approximately 60 million gallons. The emissions avoided from this reduction are the equivalent of planting almost 1 million acres of forest each year, and we're challenging ourselves to be even better. CSX recently became the first U.S. Class I railroad to have its long-term emission intensity reduction goal approved by the Science-Based Target Initiative. Reducing emissions is important to us, our customers and the communities we serve. Critically as shown on Slide 9, our operating performance continues to drive best-in-class service and reliability for our customers. Trip plan performance is the best it has ever been with 84% of merchandise carloads and 98% of intermodal containers currently meeting their hourly trip plans in April so far. This performance includes the implementation of substantial service design changes in recent weeks to adjust our network and response to the current lower volumes. Let me turn it over now to Kevin for more detail on the quarter. Great. Thank you, Kevin. Concluding on slide 14, due to the uncertain economic environment, and this should be of no surprise to anyone, we are withdrawing our guidance for the year. The potential range of outcomes for both production and demand, as well as the potential shape of the recovery are too wide to predict at this time. We are constantly assessing the economic situation and we'll respond like we always do by taking appropriate steps to control costs, but with an ever vigilant eye toward maintaining current, but most importantly, long-term service for our customers, we have worked too hard to get this right to go backwards. We are also evaluating our capital expenditure outlook for the year. Our first priority is and always will be the reliability and integrity of our railroad. We will not reduce or defer any spend that impacts safety. We will install about the same amount of rail and more balance this year than last. And Kevin and his team are looking for materials buying opportunities. We are however identifying potential areas of efficiency within our capital plan and the opportunities to defer some non-essential spend. The plan will be a fine as the year progresses, but currently, expect capital expenditures at the low end of our initial $1.6 billion to $1.7 billion range. Importantly, CSX entered into this period with a dramatically different cash flow profile than at any point in the company's history. Over the course of our transformation, we have more than doubled CSX's free cash flow conversion and ended the quarter with almost $2.5 billion of cash in short-term investments and an untapped revolver. We will take the necessary steps to ensure sufficient liquidity. These are unprecedented times. I've been through a lot in my career from Black Monday to the Great Recession and a lot of other unsettling events, but nothing like this. But I can say with certainty, long companies adapt, they make changes and they get even stronger. I hope this current situation is pet situation passes soon and we settle into the new normal. But for sure, the best is yet to come for CSX. Bill? Thanks Allison. I've talked many times about the difficulties associated with the decline on a gradual basis over the last 12 to 18 months associated with a stagnant industrial economy. And that we can respond quicker, when there are downturns. And the job that the team did in responding over the last four weeks in essence, not counting the international intermodal, let's start a little bit earlier, but over the last, a short period of time that responding to this quick downturn was nothing short of amazing. Jamie, why don't you talk about all of the steps that you guys took? Tom, as I said in my opening remarks, we have worked like dogs to get these service levels of this railroad up to where they belong and to win back credibility from our customers. And so we are \u2013 first of all and Mark can follow up on this, but Mark and Jamie, as Jamie said, are in constant communication with each other and making sure that our customers are aware of what service changes we need to make and what the impacts to our customers may be. And in many circumstances, the reason \u2013 again, the reason that we're reducing train starts is because their volumes are down and all we need to do is to have an honest dialog with our customers about the fact that we don't think we can serve them five days a week, how about three. And they go, sure, let me do, make the necessary adjustments, where it is appropriate. But Mark and his team are, as he said constantly communicating with the customers about that. Mark, why don't you follow up? Jamie, you want to take that? I guess we'll take an A minus on one of our \u2013 one of the categories. Well, Ken, that has been the number one area of concentration for me for the last month is trying to deal with not only making sure that we have the employees ready, willing and able when as this business turns around, but to make sure because of the tragic circumstances both with the disease and the economic fallout at the same time to make sure that we were very humanitarian in the way we've approached things. We have been working diligently with the labor unions from day one and have come up with some unique arrangements to address those concerns recognizing the fact that the future is clearly unknown in terms of how long this is going to last. And so we've done a lot of interesting and unique things in conjunction with labor, especially in the early days to keep the employees working and then to be able to pivot, to adjust in a manner when volumes really began to decline, but to make sure we have access to those employees when things turn back. So we have been thinking way outside the box to try and come up with ideas wherever we can. And right now I feel we're as in a good position as one could be in that circumstance. I wish I had a crystal ball in terms of future volumes, but right now we just don't have that. Mark? Hey, Scott. Well, it's certainly, freight commodities got a little different cycle to it. I think we're looking at, as an example, a reasonably good movement of fertilizer now, because that's the time of the year to do that. And I think everybody's still planning on planting a crop this year. And then in all the various buckets, a lot of them, again, as you said, agricultural, it has its own cycle based upon its commodity. It's not tied to auto production as an example. Yes, there's \u2013 certainly, yes. Certainly each element has its own drivers so to speak. And auto as an example has \u2013 is one thing that impacts a lot of different groups within the industrial and merchandise segment. And but yes, there are certain elements. I mean there's been a still be some coal is going to move. Like I said, fertilizer's going to move, grains going to get harvested. We've always relied on that grains in one straight shape or another to keep the railroads going, whether it's corn, wheat, or beer. Mark? Justin, on your comment about the dynamics between the rail versus truck in the impact that lower fuel prices might have. Where's the \u2013 that's one of the reasons why we continue to work so hard to make sure we reduce our fuel efficiency is, so that we can be more competitive with the highway. But there have been a number of a recent independent surveys that are out there right now, where they ask customers you're still planning \u2013 what do you think about rail transportation. is it reliable? yes. It's fantastic, yes. Or you like leadership probably a little bit more than I was in the past? Is there still value to shipping rail versus truck? Well, maybe it's not 15%, when oil is negative 35%. But they still stay at 10%, 10% cheaper with the same truck like service is extremely compelling in the marketplace. Right, Justin. Nothing that is game changing. We're clearly interested in any cause of financial stimulus that would involve infrastructure, because that would be a benefit to us. But no, so far to-date, the government in terms of providing flexibility to the rail industry, to be able to operate and maintain all of the safety requirements, especially with the ad hoc nature of the way some of this was implemented in the States. We have not really been implemented \u2013 impacted and the government's been very cooperative with us. Well, yes. there are two benefits \u2013 well, not call it benefits, I shouldn't use that word there. There are two opportunities for us that may arise as things evolve. First is, I think and this is just my own personal thoughts. I think that there will be more manufacturing that takes place in this country and any kind of business activity like that. It's good for the railroad. Secondly, we now can compete with a truck in the markets as they become more and more large quantity shippers that fit well into the rail dynamics, because of our service. So, with our service product that we had before and because of the disparate network the way product moved, it was difficult for the railroads to compete in e-commerce arena. I think that as we go forward, that will be a big opportunity for us. Probably, the same kind of challenges that we experienced in the past when I talked about a slow decline is harder to manage than a complete shut off. It was easier for us as to adjust as we described when the auto industry just completely shut down in a week. My guess is the auto industry won't completely start up in a week. And so we will be challenged as the traditional logistics chain is not the same. And so we'll have to \u2013 we'll have to evolve, we'll have to work with our customers and it will present more of a challenge for us. I don't see the fact that one state might come back online in certain areas two weeks before somebody else does. Texas starting out before Pennsylvania is not that big of a deal. It's the industry that will start up across the country based on the comfort level of the population as the States come back. Yes. that's why, again, we're trying to anticipate you may be heard a lot of people talking about planning, modeling, thinking, what do we do, new norms, et cetera, listen, we spent \u2013 have spent and continue to spend a lot of times brainstorming about what could happen and how are we going to be in a position to respond. Thank you. Well, I think 2008-2009 again, we saw not this sudden shutdown, but we saw clearly, a dramatic and shutdown. And as a result, we looked back to those days to see \u2013 yes, because I wasn't at CSX and pretty much none of us were here to see what the traffic declines were, what the traffic pattern declines were. And it was helpful for us to try and to understand what it's like when 20% of your business goes away in two weeks. So, lessons learned from all of those things, I hate to age myself, but yes, I've been through just about every modern day a financial calamity plus, like I said, all those in my career, but this one is clearly the most challenging. No, it's again, there's no magic to the geography, there's magic to people. And the mindset of the people here in terms of making decisions, being quick, being nimble and getting things done all while looking forward and not getting a tunnel vision is the same. We have a phenomenal team that recognizes what needs to get done and we work together and we execute. Just the way we did it before. I mean, that was, it was just good people there too. Well, you know, it's a network business. What happens to one of us happens to all of us. It wasn't that just the auto plant shutdown on CSX; they shut down across the country. We work together on a constant basis managing the fleet as it moves across the network, open lines of communication, good coordination, making sure that we don't get the a lot of equipment is stuck in one terminal that could begin to slow down the network. And I think over the last couple of years, you've heard that many of us say most of the operating people now at the various railroad all think alike. We're all kind of working off the same page in terms of moving assets and running the network to the maximum level of efficiency and that's been extremely helpful, the coordination and understanding has been extremely helpful. All right. Well, yes, we've certainly \u2013 we've certainly looked at all of the alphabets the V, the U, the L, and what I use that W as possible recovery scenarios. And obviously, the volumes in each one of those numbers is significantly different. So, as a result, because there is such a huge difference between that, that's why at this point in time, maybe, give me another 30 days, we'll have a better vision as to what the real startup plan for the auto is, what's going on with steel, what's going on with X, Y, and Z. Other than that, it's just a hypothetical exercise and that's why we didn't want to try to guess at this point in time. And so I apologize, but we're just not going to give you some kind of numbers like that. Yes, Ravi."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. As you will see in my review of the first quarter financial results, CSX was once again able to drive significant efficiency gains, hosting yet another quality operating ratio record by the top line headwinds Jim described. This quarter marks three years since the transformation of CSX, and while there remains considerable uncertainty around the severity and duration of the economic impact related to the pandemic, CSX has never been in a stronger position to take this unique challenge. Our liquidity position is extremely strong with nearly $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of March. This represents the multiples of what we would consider normal targeted cash levels. You can also imagine we have run quite a few scenarios over the past several weeks. Every model we've run has this substantial liquidity emerging in a stronger position from this downturn and leveraging the subsequent recovery. All of these scenarios will soon react and adapt our business to changing conditions, and we have already begun to quickly adjust to the current environment. From a financial perspective, we have taken many proactive steps to position the company to endure the economic downturn. First, we have ensured our cash position is liquid and available, shifting the majority of our cash investment to safer government funds for the time being. While we would like to be earning more on our cash we have taken a very conservative position until we are comfortable, conditions have normalized. We also raised an incremental $500 million of debt, taking advantage of what are historically low interest rates. But I look out over the next 36 months; we have less than $1 billion in debt maturities, which could easily be funded through our annual free cash flow. We continue to closely monitor our receivable balance and I'm not seeing any significant change to our aging profile. Our transportation services remain critical to our customers and their ability to generate cash flow. Finally, while the current backdrop is challenging, we are realizing opportunities and efficiencies that we will be able to leverage when we return to growth. These environments provide an opportunity to evaluate every cost and challenge the way we do things, and I expect the savings to be durable when growth returns. Now turning my attention to Slide 11. I'll walk you through the highlights of the summary income statement. As Jim mentioned, total revenue was down 5% in the first quarter. A significant decline in coal, lower other revenue and unfavorable mix more than offset the benefits of merchandise gains. Moving to expenses, total operating expenses were 7% lower than first quarter, driven almost entirely by the strong gains in operating efficiency we once again delivered. Labor and fringe expense was 10% lower versus the first quarter of 2019, as the average employee count was down 1,600 or 7%. Notably, even with volume directly flat year-over-year in the first quarter, we continued to find opportunities to tighten the train plan. First quarter crew starts were down 11% versus the prior year. This is a year-over-year average for the quarter and reflects efficiency gains we made over the last 12 months. Starting in the second half of March and through April to-date, we have reacted to the declining volume environment and have continued to aggressively reduce train starts. I'm sure Jamie will touch on this in the Q&A. I have also talked a lot about our focus on overtime the last few quarters, and once again, we saw a significant 33% reduction year-over-year. With current volume headwinds, we expect to continue to drive significant improvement and overtime spend. In addition to these gains and employee efficiency, we also had $14 million of lower incentive comp expense in the quarter. Finally, $10 million of other labor cost increases were primarily driven by the cycling of the railroad retirement tax refunds in the prior year. MS&O expense improved 4% versus the prior year. Continued efficiency improvements across the operating support departments, including significant reductions in engineering, contracted spend, terminal expense and crew travel, drove a $32 million reduction year-over-year in MS&O. While MS&O is traditionally less volume variables and labor costs; a month ago, we began to work to eliminate discretionary spending across the company, most of what will show up on this line item. Reductions in active locomotives and freight cars will also drive MS&O savings, and we expect outsourced terminal costs to adjust down as well. While MS&O will not be down one-for-one with volume, we are clearly focused on costs within this bucket that are traditionally less volume variable. Real estate and line sale gains of $18 million or $9 million lower in the quarter, while there continued to be a pipeline of these opportunities; sales activity is likely to be lower over the balance of the year given current economic conditions. That said, we have already closed one transaction in April and expect gains in the second quarter to be relatively flat with the first quarter. Fuel expense was $41 million favorable, an 18% improvement year-over-year driven by a 12% decrease in the per gallon price as well as significant efficiency improvement in lower volume. Our continued focus on utilization of distributed power and energy management software combined with train handling rules compliance for the first quarter of record fuel efficiency. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $14 million or 4% in the quarter, which reflects a $10 million impact in the fourth quarter 2019 depreciation study, which will continue to impact year-over-year depreciation expense for the next two quarters. We still expect full-year depreciation to be up $50 million to $60 million. Equipment, rent expense, decreased 8%. Improved network performance has enabled faster car cycle times as measured by merchandise and intermodal days per load, which include 6% and 13% respectively. This combined with lower payable volumes with the majority of the savings and equipment rents. Going forward, we will see volume related reductions and equipment rent expense. So, these will be partially offset by lower car utilization. In addition, we expect lower equity earnings from our TTX affiliate, which also show up in equipment rents. Turning below the line. Interest expense increased primarily due to higher debt balances, partially offset by a lower all-in coupon. The income tax expense increased $30 million as lower pre-tax earnings were more than offset by prior year benefits related to option exercises investing with other equity awards. Absent unique items, we continue to expect an effective tax rate of approximately 24.5% for future quarters. Closing out the P&L. As Jim highlighted in his opening remarks, CSX operating income declined 3% year-over-year, while the first quarter operating ratio of 58.7 representing an 80 basis point improvement. Turning to the cash side of the equation on Slide 12. In the first quarter of 2020, capital investment was up slightly year-over-year. We continue to invest in our core track, bridge and signal infrastructure and we continue to prioritize investments that provide safe and reliable train operations, but we are evaluating our capitals in total even during this downturn and volumes, our commitment to invest in the safety of our core infrastructure will not change. In the first quarter, free cash flow before dividends, that's $812 million, down slightly reflecting higher capital expenditures and lower proceeds from property disposition. Free cash flow has continued to be a key focus for this team and we saw free cash flow conversion exceed 100%. The company continues to demonstrate a commitment to shareholder distribution including dividend payments. Importantly, I mentioned previously, our cash in short-term investment balance entering second quarter is nearly $2.5 billion. This position gives us confidence that combined with efficiency initiatives; we can not only weather the storm in front of us, but take advantage of opportunities that may present themselves to create long-term value for shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Yes, Amit. I think that qualifies as two, and I'll give you a pass, let me do the first one going today. look, I knew the decremental margin question would come up on this call and we talked about it a lot and I know you want to plug into your models, a certain decremental margin given your assumption here, I can give you a framework, but I don't think we're going to lay out necessarily what the decremental margins could be, because there's a lot of different scenarios that could occur. What we're really focused on in this environment is taking out structural costs and really, on the other side of this really emerging and quite frankly, a better position to that maybe we would have had this not happen. So, but just going through the P&L here, obviously, the depreciation is a cost that's more something that in the near-term and medium-term is more difficult to go after. We've done a great job on becoming more capital efficient that will work its way through depreciation over time. But that's something in the near-term that's obviously part of the move. When we look at our labor costs, as I described in the script, we obviously, with the great work, that Jamie and his team have done, eliminating train starts and other things, we're seeing headcount and reduced labor come out pretty significantly with the lower volume environment that we're seeing. MS&O as your experience will tell you, it includes a lot of different items. When I look across MS&O and how we look at it internally, traditionally, we've said about 30% is highly variable, and then you have the rest of it, 25%, we've generally said it's less \u2013 structurally less variable. But those are the things that we have to look at in this environment to really go after. And so that's where we're going to challenge ourselves. Clearly the rent expense from a car hire perspective shouldn't move the volume, but there are some offsetting relationships where we want to earn as much on our fleet, in terms of rents. And then the TTX relationship obviously creates somewhat of a less volume related upside that we will traditionally see. So there's a lot of pieces, we're not going to draw the line in the sand on what the decremental margins are. I can tell you what we have done is we're taking a review of everything. Our challenge here is to variabilize every cost we can, reevaluate it and the working conditions today, working from home and all of those, I think are introducing opportunities for more efficiency for us. So we're driving those, will react as a volume plays out here over the next quarter or two. And I think you'll see additional opportunities that will drive. Yes, I'll cover a few of those headwinds. I think on the previous call I mentioned real estate sales, last year was about $160 million. We've guided for this full year of $50 million. Based on my comments we'll probably see something a little bit south of that $60 million. The market is fluid right now. We obviously feel sequentially the number will be in line with the first quarter. Fourth quarter is probably a little bit more uncertain depending on the marketing condition that exists today. We're certainly not going to buy or sell anything and we have plenty of cash and we're going to maximize value, of course. And then on the depreciation as I described, $50 million to $60 million headwind primarily related to the group life study. There is obviously non-cash, but it's impacting the income statement on that side. From a culture cycle, I'll let Mark talk a little bit more about that, but I don't think in aggregate that that headwind has changed and the market is probably somewhat similar, but I'll let Mark touch on that. Yes, it's a \u2013 clearly, it's a dynamic market right now. We're very happy and to have $2.5 billion of cash and balance sheet and growing every day, I was still generating positive free cash flows. So that's clearly, we look over the medium term and even long-term, that's not a cash balance that we are going to need on the balance sheet. And we still feel distributing this to our shareholders is something that we'll prioritize going forward when the buybacks will continue for you to discuss that over the next few months. But I would expect that at some point for that to be still a core component of our cash returns to shareholders. I mentioned on the opening remarks that we're committed to our dividend. It's something that we re-evaluate every year. We just recently this year increased that. And so we'll see what we do next year. but again, we're generating significant free cash flow even in these marketing conditions and we can cover that dividend as we continue to be committed to the shareholder returns."

            "name": "Jamie Boychuk",
            "content": "Sure, absolutely. We \u2013 obviously over the past few weeks here, we've really started to adjust our network to what we're seeing as a current \u2013 the current environment and the way that demand sits. So we've made a lot of changes out there where we've reduced over the last couple of weeks, a number of our assets. But really we've reduced our total road starts by 23% year-over-year against the 25% decline in volume. We stored over 400 locomotives since the end of March driving our active locomotive count under 2,000. To put that in perspective, three years ago when we started scheduled railroading at CSX, we had over 4,000 locomotives. We also held our merchandise train link consistent, yet we've been able to eliminate over 500 merchandise trains from our daily plan, which has more than a 20% - sorry, 50 merchandise trains from our daily plan, which is more than a 20% reduction. While we've been doing all that, we've been able to reduce our train delays by over 66%. So I think it's really important to know that these changes are not just volume related that we started, really right off the start, ready for growth, working with Mark and his team while they were driving with customers. Now, we're really starting to pivot and use the current environment to go after structural opportunities in our operation. We will continue to adjust our network as demand dictates going forward, but we are also making changes where assets will not need to come back in the future. This is really an exercise for us to continue to work close with our marketing team, adjust our volumes and network each and every day. But at the same time, we are ready when volume returns to go after that volume and not leave a carload behind. Yes, absolutely. Look, fuel is something that we talk about consistently here at CSX. And everyone on our team, on the operating team knows clearly where our targets and our goals are with respect to that. We are using technology constantly to make sure that we hit those targets as we continue to break through new records each and every quarter as we move forward. We feel confident that we will continue to show the improvement that we have in the past and we'll continue to move that forward. Definitely as our \u2013 as we fill out our trains, we make our trains bigger and longer that helps with the efficiency, where two locomotives are pulling more freight than they were before as we consolidate trains and as we continue to move forward into volume growth at some point in time when the market conditions change. But, yes, it's an important key factor. I've got an unbelievable operating team who is working on this. We have created our own small department of a few individuals who are solely concentrating on fuel efficiency and those people will continue to do what they're doing and driving the metrics to where we're seeing them. Just on some of the points that Jim kind of put out there was we have \u2013 with our union groups we have set up some agreements that will allow our employees to go on what we call a retention board. It's their choice \u2013 sorry, it's a reserve board. It's their choice to get on that board or not. Most of our employees, a large number of them have decided to go on to that board, instead of taking furlough on the T&E side. And the benefits for us, and of course these are tough decisions that we're making as we continue to work on this downturn and control our costs, but the benefits is a less carrying cost for us, but it allows the employees to have medical benefits and other benefits along the way. That gives us, in most cases, a 48-hour recall for when the volume starts to come back, we don't have to wait the normal period which is around a 15-day recall cycle. We're able to jump on volumes as Mark and his team work on as the economic conditions change. Yes. Look at \u2013 on the operating end of things, of course, we've really only got three different types of commodity. Our type of trains, I guess we would say. So, you've got our bulk service, which is easier, lower costs in most circumstances in cases. And then we have our merchandise, which is usually handled multiple times throughout a network, by the time, it gets from online or from customer to customer. With respect to the auto side of the business, I would say that it is \u2013 it's heavily on our network. It's very customer-based with respect to a lot of work done at the loading facilities and unloading facilities. So, there are a number of yards and locals, and we do have some dedicated auto trains that run in certain parts of the network. So, when it comes to cutting off auto, even though it's a revenue that we don't want to lose and it's a good revenue for us. There's, you can pull out a lot of costs with respect to auto when the auto network shuts down the way it did."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q4 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Matthew Korn, you may begin your conference.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim?\nJames Foote: Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us for today's call. First, I'm pleased to welcome Matthew to CSX, and believe his investment and research background, including coverage of many of our customers, will make him a great contributor to our team, and I wish Bill success in his new role as Head of Finance and Treasury. As we exit 2021, every CSX employee deserves recognition for their dedication to our customers in what has been another unbelievable year operating through the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. As these challenges continue into the start of the New Year, we continue to take the necessary steps to move more freight for our customers. We are putting the resources in place to deliver a high-quality service product and are working hard every day to make rail a meaningful part of our customers' transportation solutions. Throughout this period, we have remained true to our core principles, operate safely, reliably and efficiently and are committed to providing customers with additional capacity to help overcome the current challenges. These actions, combined with expected easing of supply chain disruptions, positions CSX for growth. Turning to our presentation, let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the fourth quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 12% to $1.37 billion. The operating ratio increased 310 basis points to 60.1%, which includes approximately 250 basis points from the impact from Quality Carriers and 50 basis points from higher fuel prices, and earnings per share increased 27% to $0.42 a share. I'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 4% on 3% lower volume as the impact of ongoing automotive semiconductor shortages was more than offset by revenue growth across all other merchandise markets. Industrial and construction-related end markets continued to demonstrate the strongest growth. Even though declines in energy-related markets remain a headwind for our chemical business, it\u2019s important to highlight that our core chemical, plastics and waste markets continued to show solid year-over-year growth. Intermodal revenue increased 16% on flat volumes as international growth driven by strong underlying demand and continued growth in rail volumes from East Coast ports was offset by domestic declines into ongoing driver and equipment shortages. Coal revenue increased 39% on 2% lower volume. Increases in export coal shipments, driven by the impact of rising benchmark prices, was partially offset by the effect of declines in domestic volumes, largely related to producer outages. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage, driven by supply chain disruptions, resulting from truck driver shortages, chassis availability and the lack of warehouse capacity. As we exited the fourth quarter, we clearly saw the effects of Omicron, with December volumes impacted by labor and supply chain disruptions. These challenges have continued into the New Year where we are seeing customers face labor shortages in their operations. As we look across merchandise, intermodal and coal markets, demand signals remain strong. As supply chain challenges normalize, we would expect volumes to align more with demand. Finally, I would like to highlight the positive results we have achieved by working with customers on new business development projects. Over the last few months, we have seen three significant announcements of new production of facilities to be located on CSX Railroad, including two electric vehicle plants and a new steel mill. These projects are team effort and show the ability of sales and marketing team and partnership with operations to creatively come up with solutions that meet the requirements of our customers. Importantly, these projects represent significant long-term value to CSX. Now let's discuss the progress CSX is making when it comes to our commitment to sustainability as summarized on Slide 6. Rail is the most efficient form of land-based transportation and CSX is the most fuel-efficient Class 1 railroad, U.S. Class 1 railroad. By using CSX Rail in 2021, our customers avoided 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking 2.3 million passenger vehicles off the road, an amount greater than all the hybrid and electric vehicles operating in the U.S. today. We are proud of the recognition we have received for these efforts to date by organizations such as CDP, Dow Jones, and Forbes, but we are certainly not done. CSX continues to invest in existing technologies to drive further improvement and we continue to evaluate emerging technologies, so we are prepared to realize those benefits when available. We are excited to see our customers increase focus on improving their carbon footprint. Customer engagement on ESG has accelerated and then we have seen them double their usage of CSX provided tools that help them calculate emissions savings from switching to rail. You will also see later this quarter, we will be recognizing customers for their efforts in prioritizing carbon emission savings by converting traditional truck volume to rail. I will now pass it on to Jaime to discuss our operations.\nJamie Boychuk: All right. Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Jim referenced, we are working very hard to provide customers the capacity to help overcome the persistent supply chain challenges. One of the areas we have discussed in our ongoing T&E hiring initiatives, this effort is beginning to pay dividends as more employees finish training and begin moving freight. We are also encouraged to see ongoing hiring momentum at the start of the year as we continue to consistently fill weekly training classes, while maintaining a strong pipeline of candidates. In total, we roughly doubled the average number of active trainees in the quarter. Also, the number of employees qualifying and moving to active status increased almost 50% sequentially in the fourth quarter to approximately 150. And we expect this number to double to over 300 employees in the first quarter. Recently, the benefit of these additional employees have been offset by the rapid rise in COVID cases across the network. Average daily cases have increased by several 100 employees since early November and are approaching prior peak levels. That said, there is no doubt that the hiring actions taken to date have allowed us to better manage the current situation. We have also supplemented this hiring by bringing additional assets online to help offset network imbalance caused by pockets of concentrated case counts. We will maintain these tactical asset increases as needed to protect service. We will look to improve asset utilization and drive increased operating efficiency as employees return to work and our ongoing hire initiatives provide the necessary resources to move incremental volumes and deliver the expected high-quality service to our customers. Additionally, until along the way capacity improves in intermodal terminals, we will continue making the necessary investments to keep terminals fluid by providing the overflow space and supplemental labor required to move long dwelling boxes out of our terminals. We're also continuing to take a long term approach to network and infrastructure planning, and have identified several strategic exciting extension opportunities that will provide additional long-term capacity by helping to alleviate congestion, while also supporting growth for years to come. As always, we will pursue these initiatives while maintaining a balanced train plan and a continued focus on strong execution to maximize both reliability and service for our customers. I want to thank the entire operating team for their hard work and long hours they've put in to keep freight moving for our customers. Despite the incremental headwinds this quarter, service metrics remained consistent with the prior quarter and we are taking the necessary steps to drive these metrics back towards pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2022. Turning to Slide 8, safety remains fundamental to everything we do at CSX and we hold ourselves to the highest standard for our employees, customers, and the communities in which we work and operate. Our hard work to instill a culture of safety at CSX continues to drive positive results, as shown by the reduction in our train accident headcount this -- train accident rate this year. Heading into 2022, we continue to target further reductions in human factor incidents through a combination of increased awareness, best practice sharing, collaboration across regions, and expanding our successful drone program. We are also engaging with our new hires to instill our principles of safe operations and emphasize our commitment to make CSX the safest running railroad. I will now hand it to Sean to review our financial results.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Jamie and good afternoon. As you've heard, operating income grew double digits up $151 million, with revenue up 21% on gains across all major markets. Over the line, interest and other expense was $60 million favorable, reflecting the prior year debt repurchase expense. Income taxes were up on higher pretax income though we recognized $25 million in benefits this quarter, primarily related to state tax adjustments. As a result, EPS of $0.42 is up 27% versus the prior year. Now, I'd like to take a minute to walk through operating expense in more detail on the next slide. Total costs increased $451 million or 28% in the quarter. the addition of Quality Carriers drove approximately $200 million of the increase. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor driving costs up to about $115 million versus last year. Non-locomotive fuel inflation remained consistent with prior quarters just above 3%, though as we turn the page to 2022, we expect a number around 4%. Drilling into a few specific line items, labor and fringe increased $115 million or 20% in the quarter. Quality was about $30 million. Incentive compensation was a nearly $40 million headwind in the quarter, largely due to higher expected payouts versus last year, and the impact of accelerated expense for certain employees. As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. We invested over $20 million in new programs targeting our T&E workforce. In line with these efforts, average headcount increased by 230, or 1% sequentially. Labor inflation remained in line with prior quarters, though is expected to be slightly higher in 2022. Purchase services and other expense increased $198 million or 44% in the quarter. As a reminder, this is where most of the quality expense shows up, approximately $130 million. Also, you may recall that we expected investments in supply chain fluidity to result in higher costs on this line and we saw about $45 million of increased expense as we work tirelessly to drive network and terminal fluidity in light of unprecedented challenges. We expect these costs will persist until we see a normalization of labor and the broader supply chain. The remaining increase reflected both the impact of inflation as well as a number of smaller items. Depreciation was up 4% on a higher asset base. Fuel costs were up on higher price and trucking fuel. Rents were up slightly, and we had about $20 million of higher real estate gains. Going forward, you can expect a modest level of base real estate gains, similar to the $35 million we recognized in 2020 as we shift our focus towards leveraging the real estate portfolio to support growth initiatives. However, the Virginia transaction will continue to impact results in 2022 with a $20 million gain in Q1, and a $120 million gain expected in Q2. We anticipate receiving the final $125 million of cash in Q4. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 11. On a full year basis free cash flow before dividends increased 45% to $3.8 billion. As a reminder, this includes $400 million from Virginia, and over 500 million of total proceeds from property dispositions. Cash in short term investments finished the year at $2.3 billion. While this remains elevated, we nevertheless expect to continue to work the balance down this year levels more in line with our historical liquidity needs. After fully funding capital investments, shareholder returns exceeded $3.7 billion. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJames Foote: Great, thanks, Sean. Let's conclude with our outlook for the year on Slide 13. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to grow this year, driven by a combination of strong underlying economic momentum and supply chain recovery. Based on these expected tailwinds, we are targeting GDP plus volume growth for the year. Volume should build sequentially throughout the year as supply chain bottlenecks ease. As a result, growth in the second half of the year is expected to be greater than in the first half. This growth will be supported by the initiative Jamie reviewed to appropriately resource our network for the current demand environment and to ensure we can provide customers with a consistently strong service product. We also expect pricing to benefit from a combination of market forces including very strong demand for transportation services. Full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion. Our top capital priority is and always has been maintaining and improving the safety and reliability of our network. In 2022, we will replace an excess of 500 miles of rail as we continue to focus on the core infrastructure. The cost of this capital work has been offset by significant improvements in the efficiency of our engineering programs. While we expect to drive further efficiencies in 2022, our plan reflects the impact of increased inflation and a number of discrete strategic investment opportunities. We will continually evaluate future strategic opportunities as they come along, but still have ample capacity across our network to absorb future volume growth. And finally, after investing in the railroad and high return growth projects, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We are entering the year with strong demand across the economy, but shippers are facing ongoing challenges and the lack of capacity in labor, materials and transportation. Our focus remains supporting our customers by providing effective rail solutions to overcome these persistent bottlenecks. As I said earlier, we are encouraged by the progress we are making and we expect our actions combined with improving global supply chain will provide a year of steadily improving growth. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Matthew for questions.\nMatthew Korn: Thanks, Jim. Now, in the interest of time, I'd ask that everyone please limit yourselves to one question. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon, everyone, and congrats, Matt. I guess you guys didn't provide any discussion on forward profitability or margins and I get it. You have the lapping of Quality Carriers, plus lower land sale gains. So I guess, can you talk to the core efficiencies in the business and how you plan to leverage growth this year? Are there incremental opportunities for you guys to drive core profitability in outlook [ph] higher?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, thanks, Brandon. This is Sean. So just to clear the record, so you're going into full year 2022, we're going to have the full year impact of Quality and have lower real estate gains, as I just outlined, that together is about a 350 basis point impact. So on a like-for-like basis, you're starting at a 59 OR. Fundamentally, nothing has really changed about our story, right? Our expectation, as we come out of the pandemic this year, is for supply chains to normalize. As they do that, some of this - some of the costs that we've added in order to better serve our customers will start to come down a little bit. Obviously, the incremental growth that we see, stronger in the second half than in the first half of the year, should be at good incremental margins. And so at the end of the day, I think the core story that you've seen over the last couple of years with us is the same next year or this year, as it's been. The only unknown is what's the pace of the normalization? How do we get -- how quickly do we overcome what we're seeing right now out there in the environment.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thanks. Good evening. I just wanted to ask, Kevin, maybe you can go through some of the puts and takes of the outlook for some of the key end markets? I know Sean just talked about some of the uncertainty around the supply chains. But where do you feel like you have some maybe more opportunities that could come to bear and where you see some of the challenges? And then if you can layer in some of the impact of those new business development wins, it sounds like they might be a little bit more longer dated, but is it too early to see some benefit from those?\nKevin Boone: Yes, thanks, Brian. Look, there's a lot of demand tail winds that we see. There's pretty robust demand across pretty much every end market currently, so we're optimistic there. As Sean pointed out that supply chain challenges and I think the timing of those normalizing is probably the biggest question as we move into second, third or fourth quarter kind of when does that really translate into some more, better fluidity out there for us. But starting with merchandise, really, it's a story of auto, when did the autos really start to -- production really start to come back online. When you look at our current estimates, it's really for a back half story on the volume and certainly autos drives more than just the current car loads in the auto side such as the metals business, plastics business for us as well. So auto is going to be very, very important. Certainly, we all know the demand. We've all been to the local dealership and they do not have any new cars. If you want a new car you've probably got to wait 12 months, so that's - the demand is there. There is no question about it. What we see right now, the metals business is very strong. Plastics remains very, very strong. Probably the only thing that we're really seeing weak and I touched on a little bit is the energy market and then that's all about spreads. And spreads can collapse and then get out again, so we'll continue to watch those and we'll benefit if those get more positive in the future. On the intermodal side, we've really benefitted from the international market and we see no slowdown at this point. There's still a lot of ships waiting at the port to get in and we've been very successful in moving that freight and we continue to have the operations and I think we'll continue to benefit from that. The domestic side is really where we've seen a disruption and that's been largely due to the driver shortage, the equipment shortages that we're seeing on the chassis side. And to be honest, I think the chassis problem seems to be being pushed out every month. I know the suppliers are having a hard time ramping up production, but that's probably going to be a second half story in terms of the chassis as far as we see it right now. So - but we do see the underlying demand there and I think that's a good positive story for us into the back half of the year. And then finally, when moving to the coal. The demand is outstripping supply. You see it in the exports benchmark prices, they are incredibly strong right now. We\u2019re at an all-time highs almost and when you look at the net and thermal markets today. And so we have some opportunity there. The mines had struggled quite frankly. They are underinvested. They had a hard time ramping back up production. Some have dealt with strikes. Some have dealt with other problems. And so those things should normalize hopefully and we should see the benefit of that. We've also seen recently a new mine come on line and so that should help us as we get through the year. But those, I think the biggest question is how long do the export prices stay at this levels? But we would expect hopefully volumes to pick up as we move through the year. Those are some of the moving parts due to the markets.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thanks, Kevin. If I can ask for just a quick comment on coal inventory levels. Do you think you can see some restocking given some of the dynamics you talked about with demand outstripping supply specifically on the domestic utility side?\nKevin Boone: Yes, coal levels, particularly in our Southern utilities are very low. So there's restocking as needed. We're working really closely with our customers, and I would expect that to persist through this year and probably in the next.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask you a bit about how closely we should tie your own capacity and your growth in conductors coming out of the training classes. It seems like you have a nice pipeline and a nice ramp up in that. How closely should we tie that volume growth to that ramp in your capacity? And is that the right way to think about it? Or do you think that the factors outside of your control in broader supply chain are kind of a bigger variable in terms of your volume growth?\nJames Foote: Tom, it's Jim. Just generally, clearly, CSX is no different than any other industry right now, where we have been challenged finding people to come to work. And because we have been short on our train and engine service employees, simple fact is we have not been able to move the amount of freight we could have, had we've been staffed up at the appropriate levels. That's why we've been talking for the last year at least about our attempts to try and ramp up the hiring of operating employees. And as Jamie said, we're starting now just now after 12 months of very, very hard work to get it back to a positive growth number in terms of the number of employees. And when we do that, we'll be able to move more freight. Jamie, do you want to add more detail?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. I think Jim pretty much nailed it. This is probably one of the most difficult environments we've ever seen. When you think about all the stuff the rail industry has gone through over the past 10, 20 years, my 25 years of railroading, I can tell you, when you come in one week and you've got 60 people off on COVID a new variant comes through, and you've got 350 off on COVID on your T&E side, you really start to feel the effects. And believe me, Kevin and I are talking all the time about the opportunities of moving as much product as we can for our customers. And not only just the product that we currently have with our current customers, but the growth side of things and what else can we move out there. So to Jim's point, our hiring classes of over, I would say, probably the past two months have been extremely successful. We are putting 150-plus T&E, well new conductors, I guess, through our training center in Atlanta and we continue every single week to hold a new class. And I'm proud to say that all the hard work our HR team has done through Diana Sorfleet is paying off. And honestly, when we start looking at where we're going to be in three or four months from now, we're going to be a different look in railroad and these opportunities that Kevin is talking about is going to be opportunities that we're going after.\nTom Wadewitz: So are you optimistic about a quick improvement related to Omicron or really just focus on second quarter for that improvement in capacity?\nJames Foote: Yes, Tom, it's Jim. We're thinking about maybe getting an epidemiologist on staff. So if you're ready to step up and tell us, this is it, this is going to be over in two months, and we're not going to see another one, come on, you can start tomorrow.\nTom Wadewitz: Sounds like second quarter. Thank you, Jim.\nJames Foote: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nChristian Wetherbee: Yes, hey thanks, good afternoon guys. Maybe I wanted to ask a question on pricing. So Kevin, maybe when you think about renewals for 2022, maybe how -- what the opportunity set is there and maybe how those are progressing as we've gotten through the month of January here? And then on the coal side, any help you can give us with how to think about yields and maybe just the first half of the year or over the course of 2022? I know the thermal exports are probably a full year renewal, so maybe you have some uplift there, but I think some of the next stuff is a little bit more closer to market. So if you could just help us with those points, that would be great.\nKevin Boone: Yes. So let me cover the pricing side first, and obviously, we're going to get this question. The market is -- clearly, there's tight from the supply chain from the transportation side. You've seen our primary competition, truck rates are up significantly, and we're having to react to that, obviously, in what we're doing, but also working with customers on opportunities for them to convert more freight over to rail. In this high inflation market, they're looking for ways that they can save on their transportation costs and rail is almost every time the most economical solution for them. And so those discussions, I'm happy to say are really accelerating now and talking to Jamie every day on what we can do. So that's a really real positive for us. So I would say, certainly, the market is better than it was last year. We're working with customers. They understand the cost pressures that are out there across the world, they're seeing it. They're asking their customers for the same. So we're seeing some positive momentum on that side. In terms of coal, I mentioned it in my opening remarks, export coal prices benchmarks are at highs. What we\u2019ve assumed and your guess is probably as good as mine is that will moderate through the year. But what I can tell you is, if the economy reaccelerates post Omicron and China demand continues to be strong, then who knows it could last much longer. But what our assumption is going forward is that likely those prices will come down, so that will impact the yields somewhat into the back half of the year. But offsetting that somewhat we would expect maybe some volume progress as the producers ramp up some of their production as one of the new coal mines that I mentioned comes online as perhaps one of the coal mines that we serve resolve their strike and there's another major mine that we have right now that's shut down completely. So hopefully, some of those things come back online and help us on the volume side.\nChristian Wetherbee: That's great. And just quickly, merchandise and intermodal, how much of the contracts come up for renewal at the beginning of the year?\nKevin Boone: Yes, we see about 50% to 60% renewed annually and about, call it, 75% of those in the first and fourth quarters of the year.\nChristian Wetherbee: Great. Thank you very much.\nKevin Boone: Yes.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon. Jim, Union Pacific this morning talked about growing faster than industrial production or about 4.8% for their level of carloads. You picked GDP in your outlook. I just want to understand kind of trying to parse your growth target, which includes services on GDP. So can you kind of talk about that overall target or maybe that's a Sean question. And then you're now more than half a year in with Quality, are you seeing any of the contributions that you expected at this point from the acquisition? Thanks.\nJames Foote: Yes, I'll talk about, Ken good to talk to you. Yes, I think we're comfortable with the Quality so far. I mean, it's playing out as we had expected. The customer enthusiasm about this product that we have in the marketplace now is very good. A lot of conversations are ongoing about converting to a transload type of operation versus truck direct. So -- and we haven't even got the equipment yet here from -- to utilize some of the ISO containers, which will help this conversion even more. So all in, yes, I mean, they're a great team, really smart people, extremely enthusiastic and excited about this opportunity so far. I think Sean is probably better to mediate between Lance's [ph] view of growth in mind.\nSean Pelkey: I don't know about that, but I can just kind of give you a little bit of color, which I think Kevin really sort of already went through in terms of each of the markets and the puts and takes there. But I think the first half of the year or first quarter, at least on the auto side, we're going to continue to remain challenged. So and you can see it in our weekly numbers in terms of how that's trending. So the hope is that as we get into the second half of the year, that's part of kind of what drives the above GDP growth. Kevin also talked about some of the growth initiatives and the three he mentioned aren't the only three. Obviously, there's a lot going on within the sales and marketing team in terms of attracting new business to the railroad. And then fundamentally, our ability to capture the demand picture that's out there, assuming that the recent momentum we've had on the hiring front continues, and the tools that we're using in terms of retaining the employees we have continue to be successful, we grow the active T&E count, we're going to be able to move more volume.\nKen Hoexter: Okay, thanks Jim. Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Chappell: Thanks Emma. Good afternoon everybody. Jamie, we've spent a lot of time on labor for obvious reasons, not just impacting you, it's impacting your customers as well. But if we could go all the way back to a few quarters ago before it really kind of rears had and the supply chain got into a real bad congestion issue, I know you were out in the field kind of looking for other type of improvements you can make within the network. So as we think about right-sizing the organization, getting through some of the supply chain congestion into normalized \u201cfluidity\u201d you guys seemed to have a head start here. So are there other opportunities for you within the network, whether it's just on trip plan performance or some of the cost levers in the back half of the year into 2023 that you think being a front runner here, you have a real opportunity on a relative basis?\nJamie Boychuk: Jon, we are always analyzing the railroad. So I'm going out there again next week to spend some time on the railroad, and we'll be analyzing again what we're doing with our plan out there. So of course, as market conditions change, and other factors that go on out there, we analyze what we do. Yes, we just finished finding different opportunities to service our customers better, particularly in the Carolinas. We spent a lot of time out there just over this past quarter. But as I mentioned, we've put some assets out there in order to ensure that we can provide the service that our customers require right now. So there are some expenses that go along with that. And we see a quarter or two from now as our hiring catches up to where we need it to be, we'll be able to pull those assets back and/or use those assets for continued growth as we move forward. So there is -- there absolutely is always an opportunity on our railroad. The job of the folks out there, who are working really hard on the ground, their job is to execute. The network centers job is to analyze. And I work between those folks to make sure we're making the right decisions, and we'll continue to do that. So yes, there's always opportunities, but I can tell you right now, our focus is on growth. Our focus is on service and our focus is to make sure we continue to balance those expenses along the way. So that's going to be where we continue to push in towards 2022.\nJonathan Chappell: Great. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks. Hi everyone. I just had a couple of quick hit questions and then one kind of maybe a broad one for Jim. But for Sean, I wasn't sure about this when you answered it earlier. Are the margins of the business going to improve on a year-over-year basis against the 58.1 OR that you did in 2021 and I'm obviously excluding Virginia, I understand the timing of the Quality Carriers acquisition and all that, but ex-Virginia, are the margins going to improve year-over-year relative to the 58.1? And related to that, could you just talk about maybe what the expectations are on SS oil revenues year-over-year? Because I think that will probably be a little bit of a headwind in 2022. And then sorry, Jim, one out of the box question a little bit. You've had great success leading CSX and the whole team over the last many years under very difficult circumstances for sure. What is the thought process around succession planning? Do you plan or are you willing to lead CSX for many, many more years to come or do you think there is some scope for change internal or external? Can you just talk about that? Because it's a question that I get and we get a lot and I thought it would be interesting to get your thoughts on it as well. Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Amit, this is Sean. I'll take the first two to begin with. So on your operating ratio question, you've got the 58.1 full year impact of Quality. So what I was saying is that kind of takes you to a 59. So I think your question is, can we do better than that in 2022? And we're not going to give OR guidance today. And -- but that being said, I think we've kind of walked through all the factors that are going to drive growth, both in terms of our volumes, our revenues as well as operating income and what that means for OR. We go into the year with a little bit of an elevated cost profile. Probably in Q1, you're going to see costs that are largely similar to Q4, given that things have not gotten better from a supply chain and labor availability perspective. As we go through the year, we think that does improve. And if it does, then we also see volumes come along with it. And we think that sets us up very, very well. There are other uncertainties. What happens in the coal market with export coal pricing and other factors like Kevin talked about. And then the other piece of it that you hit on was the other revenue, I think largely other revenue is going to trend with the broader supply chain because the issues that we're facing that are causing containers to dwell on the intermodal side are the same factors that we're facing more broadly in the economy between driver availability, chassis availability and so on. And so it's likely other revenue is going to remain elevated here in the first quarter. And then I would say our baseline expectation is that it begins to normalize starting next quarter and then hopefully sort of back to normal by the second half of the year, which means we're probably moving more volumes, so those are the factors.\nJames Foote: On the question of succession, clearly, it's been a topic since I got here starting in the beginning of 2018. You may recall, there's been quite a significant change in the management makeup here over that four-year period. And it has always been my goal and has always been the goal of the Board to make sure that we had in place a rock-solid diligent succession planning process and the procedure to follow for all of the executive management jobs. And I think when you talk on the call today and you heard these great new voices that are, so doing such an exceptional job, that's because of the diligence that went into making sure that we always have an available pipeline of qualified talent. And I could tell you from working with the Board, that's no different from my job. Our job and the Board's job is to make sure when Jim decides to go whenever that might be. Hopefully, it's when I decide not when they decide. But whenever we're going to fill that job that we have qualified people, both internally and externally that can step right in and being a significant shareholder, I hope you can do a better job than I think I have done. Maybe other people disagree, but it's been an interesting ride.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes, well I appreciate you entertaining my question. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Nolan: Yes, I have two probably quick ones, if I can squeeze them in. The first is just when we're looking at the $2 billion of CapEx, curious if you might be able to parse that out between -- or what portion of that might actually be growth related? And the other one is, you talked a little bit about coal outages and I know there was an issue it occurs, how should we think about coal in the first quarter specifically?\nSean Pelkey: Hi Ben, this is Sean. I'll take your first question around the CapEx and I would say CapEx is up about $200 million versus 2021. About half of that is related to growth investments. So Jamie talked a little bit about the sidings already, which set us up very well for the long-term to grow into the capacity that he'll be creating. We're making some incremental investments on the technology side. Some of the Quality investments in the ISO tanks fall into that category and then some commercial facilities. So lots of good high-return growth-oriented investments. The balance of the increase in capital is really driven by sort of inflation in the core infrastructure spend as well as slight increase in hardening the core infrastructure for safety and reliability.\nJamie Boychuk: I would just add on the CapEx side that the siding extensions we're looking at mostly on our L&M part of our property, which was down in the Southern, Southwestern part of the railroad where we had smaller sidings. It worked for us, but the growth coming out of some of that area through Alabama and other stuff that's going on, the need is there. So that's where the majority of this CapEx money is going to, and we're excited to get it out in that area to support that growth that Kevin and his group are bringing. With respect to Curtis Bay, yes, we were down for a couple of weeks, but we're back up doing direct dumping. We did redirect a few trains to a couple of different locations, but we are back in business.\nBenjamin Nolan: All right, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact you expect from Quality in 2022 from both the revenue and operating expense perspective as we try to model that out? And then circling back to some of the labor commentary, can you help us think through what you're expecting for the sequential change in headcount as we progress through this year?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Justin, it's Sean. I can take both of those. So the Quality impact is pretty straightforward. What you saw in the second half of this year, both in terms of revenue and expense is probably a pretty good run rate going into the next year into 2022, will have kind of a happier impact in Q1 and Q2 and then as we get into the back half, it should be pretty similar. The things that are going to drive any difference would really have to do with driver availability. The demand is very strong on the Quality side, but that's how I would think about it. So, a little over $400 million of revenue in the second half of this year. That's probably a good run rate around $200 million a quarter. In terms of sequential labor headcount, so you saw an increase of 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I think that's probably a pretty good estimate of what we might see over the next couple of quarters. The good news is, as Jamie talked about, the head count we report to you includes both T&E employees who are in training as well as those that are marked up in revenue service. The mix between those that are in training and in service will change a little bit over the course of the first half year, which is great news. But the headcount should go up very modestly on a sequential basis over the first couple of quarters here.\nJustin Long: Okay, helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So Sean, we have some pretty big headwinds from comp per employee and purchase services in the quarter, I think, including some accelerated costs. How should we think about those two pieces this year? And then, Kevin, just circling back on coal for one second, was your point about the net prices at highs suggesting that there's another sequential uptick in coal RPU in 1Q?\nSean Pelkey: Scott, so comp per employee, you're right, it was elevated here in the fourth quarter, and that was one of the big factors there obviously was the incentive comp piece. So that should normalize as we get into 2022. I think if you look at it, excluding that for the back half of this year, that's probably a good baseline to build off of. We're going to have some higher labor inflation, which includes health costs as well as payroll tax and railroad unemployment. That will be partially offset by the incentive comp and then there's some favorable mix from the Quality addition in the first half of the year. Hopefully, as we get later into the year and the network is cycling better, we also see a reduction in overtime and things like that. So they're probably as a result of inflation, there will be a modest increase versus the normalized comp per employee, but not significant. And then in terms of purchase services, that's a line that has a lot of different moving pieces. What I can tell you is that you're probably going to see something similar in the first quarter to what you saw in the fourth quarter. But a lot of the costs that we added recently have to do with offsite storage and intermodal facilities, supplemental labor, adding some locomotives things like that. And that ties directly to overall fluidity within not only our network but the broader supply chain. So as that gets better, the purchase services costs should come down commensurate with that.\nKevin Boone: Yes. And then on the coal RPU, we would expect something probably flattish in first quarter versus fourth quarter. Mix always matters. I would say the mix in terms of our domestic coal side should we see some of the supply issues at the mine and prove could help some of that southern coal longer haul pull maybe later here in the quarter that could help, but largely flat is the way we see it today.\nScott Group: Okay. Sean, if I can just clarify one thing. It sounds like the purchase services headwind is an offset to this assessorial stuff. So as the accessorial goes lower, the purchase services costs go lower too, so don't think about the accessorial as 100% margin. Is that clear?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, that's correct. I think it's --- that's right. That's right. Now probably accessorial may come down a little bit faster than purchase services just as -- just from a timing perspective, but they will trend together.\nScott Group: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.\nBascome Majors: Yes, thanks for taking my question. Jim, you talked a little bit about having a lot of new faces in management over the last few years since you've been in the company. Can you talk about potentially updating the investor community with an Investor Day, other type of in? I mean it's approaching for years, you've acquired some non-rail businesses, you've got new faces and we've been through the global pandemic. Just curious when you think it might be time to kind of share your vision of where you think and you take CSX kind of midterm and how we're going to get there? Thank you.\nJames Foote: I think we had probably planned on doing another Investor Day, at least a year ago, if not longer. But I don't really -- I personally have not felt that it's really that useful via teams or via Zoom and have every time we've kind of talked about getting out to New York or doing something here or whatever it is, something else comes along and kind of puts the kibosh on our plans. So as soon as Tom Waterwood gets here and tells me when the pandemic is going to end, then we'll schedule it up and get out and talk to all of you. I'd love to show this team off, they're fantastic.\nBascome Majors: Yes, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJason Seidl: Hey, thank you, operator. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I wanted to talk a little bit about the performance in the quarter on the operational side. I think this was the first time your trip plan compliance for the carload division got above 70%. So I wanted to find out what was going on there? And what else needs to be done to sort of try to close that gap between carload and Intermodal?\nJamie Boychuk: Thank you, Jason. I'd say, as you've followed probably quarter-to-quarter, it is a slow climb. We're working really hard on the service product. It really comes down to the availability of people. Our COVID numbers were down into October, November, where we had maybe 30 or 40, maybe up to 60 T&E employees and then towards the end of the year up to where we are today, well over 300 to 350 folks off. So for us to really get this service product where we're arriving on the hour, as we continue to commit to, it really comes down to people. And we've been saying this for probably over a year now as we've struggled to even get that pipeline going. Now we've got a great pipeline. We continue to fill those classrooms and the folks in Atlanta are doing an absolute amazing job under Jim Switzenberg [ph] and his team. It's all about producing conductors and as this quarter continues, we should see that number come up, but again I think Jim has mentioned couple of times, it all comes down to what happens in the world with respect to COVID or whatever the next pandemic or item might be that affects our crewing of our trains, so that for us is the dial that really turns us up and down when we think about our service product.\nJason Seidl: So I guess we'll just wait for a while to confirm the end of both, but good job and the numbers and we\u2019ll look for more steady improvement as the year goes on. I appreciate the time.\nJames Foote: Well, you'll see that number we publish; we publish our velocity as well every week. And that\u2019s a good proxy for understanding of how fluid the railroad network is, whether you\u2019re trying to look at it from a service standpoint, a customer perspective and where we in terms of trip plan compliance or how much extra cost we're having out there because we're running slow. In the region, we run slow. It is not that the locomotives moving at a lower rate of speed, it's sitting someplace because it gets to a terminal where it's supposed to be recruited and there is nobody; we don\u2019t have an employee to get on the train because he got sick. And so, as that velocity number increases, as that drone number goes down, the result is that our customer performance metrics or our trip plan compliance numbers will just improve over time.\nJason Seidl: Well, I always appreciated the fact that you guys publish this, because trip plan compliance is what most shippers look at anyway, so I much appreciate on my end.\nJason Seidl: Good, great.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi good afternoon. Just some, one if I have some thoughts on round revenue per carload, sort of from the total company perspective, obviously coming off two strong quarters, we talked a little about the first quarter recall, but as you think about moving through the year, taking into account mix, how do you think about revenue per carload first half, second half of wherever you want to talk through it? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Hey, this is Kevin. I'll take this one. Clearly, yes, we had some strong performance. Some of that, obviously, was due to the impact of fuel surcharge. We see that probably being a favorable impact into the first quarter and probably less so as you move into the back half of the year and just face tougher comparisons there. There's a couple probably larger swing items we've talked about quite a bit already but the export coal side will be a large swing item into the second half of the year if prices and the benchmark prices remain. That will obviously be a good impact. We've talked about how we reprice 50% to 60% of our business every year, and so you'll start to see that impact start to flow through probably more heavily in the back half of the year. And then on, those are probably the major moving parts across the business and obviously mix always matters. If intermodal is outgrowing your merchandise side of your business, that's always a negative mix. So we would, we would expect merchandise to remain strong, but intermodal has proven over the last few years to be outgrowing merchandise, which is a good thing, but can have a negative impact on the overall RPU.\nJordan Alliger: Okay, thanks for the color.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much operator. Good morning or good afternoon everyone. Just a question here on the environment that we're in right now and how different it is and whether that creates opportunities for you to kind of re-envision some of the historical practices, you do, particularly around contracts with customers and contracts with employees. So given Jim, you mentioned you just can't get an Jamie as well, you can't get people, I\u2019m wondering if this sets the stage possibly for a bigger push on automation, perhaps it's a little easier to get automation through if the workforce is short people? And secondly, same thing on the customer base, if you've got a customer base if you got a -- high demand for transportation services, does it allow you to perhaps restructure aspects of the contract that you might not have been able to do in the past, open up that door whether it's on duration to your favor longer or shorter. I'm not sure which one you would prefer, but items like that on either of those two, I'd love to hear any color that you might have?\nJames Foote: Well, on the customers, we have -- for good or bad, and yes, maybe this -- the last two years has caused us to rethink everything because things that we never thought were possible to happen, have happened. So we look at -- I think we look at the world differently. Our relationships with our customers is -- this is a big business. It's a big business. Our -- we have relatively long term, not as long as some contracts. But a couple of three-year duration with a customer who is making huge capital investments in these plants, in order to produce and has to have some level of longer-term reliability on what is transportation costs are going to be for them to be able to plan how to run its business. So trying to change that is difficult. I think every -- and again, our customers are reasonable people. So I think there's dialogues about what works there's always what works for both. It's a partnership arrangement in terms of how we help our customers be successful in these markets. In some circumstances, it may have accelerated our views to a certain degree in terms of -- there's been a modification. There's certainly been a change in the e-commerce arena about who buys themselves transportation in the marketplace. And so, we're dealing in certain circumstances more directly with the customers as it worked with third parties in -- that we did in the past and I think that's something that probably will evolve and continue to change. In terms of working with how we interact and how we contract with people that want to work for us, I think this is a big challenge and a huge opportunity for us to really upfront address what we think the worker who wants to work for the railroad is, what's the profile of that individual, not six months from now and not a year from now, but five years and 10 years from now. And how do we evolve for this industry in an extremely again, in most circumstances, how would you do this differently? How can you do this better? We can't put kiosks in place to do the work of a conductor or an engineer. But there's certainly technology out there that would allow us to do things more effectively, easier and probably with fewer employees. But we also work in an extremely heavily unionized environment that is also very heavily regulated with at times bent on telling us how we should do things. So we're always in the middle of going through the process and but yes, it's opened our eyes, and I think it's opened everybody's eyes in the transportation business about what we need to do to be more effective and handle these types of issues in the future.\nWalter Spracklin: Have you found that the automation question has been easier to enter into with unions in the current environment compared to previously?\nJames Foote: No.\nWalter Spracklin: Okay, I appreciate the time, Jim.\nJames Foote: You bet.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the time. Two from me, Jamie, could you talk a little bit about where you expect headcount to be as we exit sort of the 2022 time frame? And then, Jim, I'd love to get your perspective having had some time presumably to review Norfo Gas [ph] asset and the CPKC transaction. Kind of what do you think about that and what you think about the implications of that, what you think the implications of that ask would be for CSX in the long run?\nJamie Boychuk: Just touching, I think Sean talk a little bit about it. But look, we have 6% to 8% attrition per year. We have to remember that. So not only do we have to hire to cover attrition, we've got to hire to get that number where we need to be in our minds to be able to provide the service that's required and the growth that Ken and his group are going after. So I'll leave it -- I'll kind of leave it at this. We are actively hiring. We have over 500 conductor trainees right now between Atlanta and what's out in the field and we're not stopping. We're going to continue to get folks out there qualified as conductors. And we've got a round of qualifying for locomotive engineers here at some point within the next year or two. So -- but we want to make sure that we can provide that service and grow this company.\nJames Foote: As it relates to the other railroads' filings in the CP and KCS deal, I'm not surprised at all, but the other railroads, some of the other railroads have weighed in with the requests to make sure that their franchises and their customers primarily are protected. And each railroad has its own unique requests and that process is just starting. We're just -- we didn\u2019t get involved in the substantive conversation around what the impacts are of that transaction. You may have seen that we took the position with the FTB that we didn't have enough information basically yet to formulate an opinion. So until we have gone on the record, so to speak, with what it is, what it is that we're going to ask for and we're still kind of looking at what it is we're going to ask for and what do other people ask for and what does that mean that sort of thing? It's really -- I'm not going to comment on any specific filing that any other railroad that made yet.\nDavid Vernon: That's fair. But I guess, if I could just press a little bit. Is the scope of that Norfo Gas surprising to you or are you -- was that kind of as expected?\nJames Foote: Again, I'm not going to characterize anything.\nJamie Boychuk: No, no comments at this point.\nJames Foote: No. Like I said, it's not probably would be a comment really one way or the other where I thought it was aggressive or not aggressive or it's -- we're trying to figure out what everybody is doing and that takes time. It's a long, long, long process here for us to gather information, for us to look at everything, and then we'll formulate what we think is the right thing for CSX to do. And then at that point in time, we'll be in a better position to comment on what I think about whatever everybody else asked for.\nDavid Vernon: That\u2019s fair. Thanks a lot for the time guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is now open.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much. Good afternoon We're starting to run a little long, so I'll just ask a quick one here in terms of coal and the producer outages that you experienced during the quarter and the new mine you have coming online, just wondering if you can help us frame that a little better in terms of the tonnage impact and the timing of when it could come back or come online initially in case of the new mine?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I wish I had a crystal ball. There's one particular mine that keeps on telling us that they're going to come back online, and it seems to get pushed out every week. And so, no I don't have a lot of visibility, I have probably more confidence that as we get into the second, third, fourth quarter that we\u2019ll see some pickup there. The good news is they have a lot more cash to reinvest in their business, whether it's equipment and other things. So I would think we'll see some benefits of that as well. I mentioned one particular customer dealing with the strike. Those things have continued for quite a while, but eventually those things get resolved as well. The other one, the mine that I mentioned that's coming online, it will be a slow ramp-up, and we would expect more volumes in the second half and that's mainly into the export market. So we're positive there. We're -- it's a supportive market obviously, and we're going to look for opportunities to move more coal as we get more crude availability into the second half.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you everyone. One big picture question and one follow-up. The big -- bigger question is on domestic intermodal. Just based on your conversations with your customers, kind of do you have a sense of what it's going to take for shippers to move significant amount of volumes off truck and third on the rail. Is it as simple as just clearing the congestion or are there more complex issues with speed and service and flexibility that kind of take longer to resolve? And just a followup, Kevin, you kind of mentioned the cadence of your contract renewals, we are seeing on the truck side that customers are trying to push for shorter contracts or more frequent price resets on the contract side are you seeing anything similar? Thank you.\nKevin Boone: On the contract side, nothing has really changed. We're obviously working with customers to create more even cadence through the rail network and I work with Jamie all the time, and we go out to customers and explain the challenges that they create and they can create more ratability of their volumes through our system. That's extremely helpful. And so working with them a lot on that side, so that's a big opportunity there. And then what was the first part of the question?\nRavi Shanker: Just intermodal and kind of what it takes to get\u2026?\nKevin Boone: Okay, yes. On the intermodal side, I think having spoken to you recently just one of our many customers; I think consumer behavior is actually going the other way. The expectation is not that they necessarily need something next day. So I would say, the emphasis on speed is actually going the other way to some degree, and we're seeing conversations around maybe I don't need to move it over a truck and get it there in 24 hours, that 48, 72-hour option is valuable. It's obviously cost effective, where a lot of our customers are looking to offset very, very high prices. I would say, on the domestic side, really the challenge has been equipment. It's not a lack of demand. We get calls every day. They want to put more volume on us. But if they can't get the volume out of the terminal, that's a problem. And that's what we've been dealing with. But we think that will resolve itself. It's obviously going to be easier to get truck drivers that you can get home at night that are doing the short haul, and that really plays into our sweet spot. The long-haul truckers aren't there. And I don't think that the drivers are going to come back to that market, but we do think the shorter haul drivers are going to become more and more available. But it's not just the drivers, it's the chassis, and we know there's a lot of orders out there, and so that will resolve itself. And then the container side, a lot of containers being ordered right now. So we do think as we get into the second half, we'll have a lot of tailwinds that will help us really accelerate growth.\nRavi Shanker: Great, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference.

            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for joining us for today's call. First, I'm pleased to welcome Matthew to CSX, and believe his investment and research background, including coverage of many of our customers, will make him a great contributor to our team, and I wish Bill success in his new role as Head of Finance and Treasury. As we exit 2021, every CSX employee deserves recognition for their dedication to our customers in what has been another unbelievable year operating through the ongoing impacts of the pandemic and supply chain disruptions. As these challenges continue into the start of the New Year, we continue to take the necessary steps to move more freight for our customers. We are putting the resources in place to deliver a high-quality service product and are working hard every day to make rail a meaningful part of our customers' transportation solutions. Throughout this period, we have remained true to our core principles, operate safely, reliably and efficiently and are committed to providing customers with additional capacity to help overcome the current challenges. These actions, combined with expected easing of supply chain disruptions, positions CSX for growth. Turning to our presentation, let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the fourth quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 12% to $1.37 billion. The operating ratio increased 310 basis points to 60.1%, which includes approximately 250 basis points from the impact from Quality Carriers and 50 basis points from higher fuel prices, and earnings per share increased 27% to $0.42 a share. I'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details. Great, thanks, Sean. Let's conclude with our outlook for the year on Slide 13. We remain optimistic about the opportunity to grow this year, driven by a combination of strong underlying economic momentum and supply chain recovery. Based on these expected tailwinds, we are targeting GDP plus volume growth for the year. Volume should build sequentially throughout the year as supply chain bottlenecks ease. As a result, growth in the second half of the year is expected to be greater than in the first half. This growth will be supported by the initiative Jamie reviewed to appropriately resource our network for the current demand environment and to ensure we can provide customers with a consistently strong service product. We also expect pricing to benefit from a combination of market forces including very strong demand for transportation services. Full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion. Our top capital priority is and always has been maintaining and improving the safety and reliability of our network. In 2022, we will replace an excess of 500 miles of rail as we continue to focus on the core infrastructure. The cost of this capital work has been offset by significant improvements in the efficiency of our engineering programs. While we expect to drive further efficiencies in 2022, our plan reflects the impact of increased inflation and a number of discrete strategic investment opportunities. We will continually evaluate future strategic opportunities as they come along, but still have ample capacity across our network to absorb future volume growth. And finally, after investing in the railroad and high return growth projects, we remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. We are entering the year with strong demand across the economy, but shippers are facing ongoing challenges and the lack of capacity in labor, materials and transportation. Our focus remains supporting our customers by providing effective rail solutions to overcome these persistent bottlenecks. As I said earlier, we are encouraged by the progress we are making and we expect our actions combined with improving global supply chain will provide a year of steadily improving growth. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Matthew for questions. Tom, it's Jim. Just generally, clearly, CSX is no different than any other industry right now, where we have been challenged finding people to come to work. And because we have been short on our train and engine service employees, simple fact is we have not been able to move the amount of freight we could have, had we've been staffed up at the appropriate levels. That's why we've been talking for the last year at least about our attempts to try and ramp up the hiring of operating employees. And as Jamie said, we're starting now just now after 12 months of very, very hard work to get it back to a positive growth number in terms of the number of employees. And when we do that, we'll be able to move more freight. Jamie, do you want to add more detail? Yes, Tom, it's Jim. We're thinking about maybe getting an epidemiologist on staff. So if you're ready to step up and tell us, this is it, this is going to be over in two months, and we're not going to see another one, come on, you can start tomorrow. You bet. Yes, I'll talk about, Ken good to talk to you. Yes, I think we're comfortable with the Quality so far. I mean, it's playing out as we had expected. The customer enthusiasm about this product that we have in the marketplace now is very good. A lot of conversations are ongoing about converting to a transload type of operation versus truck direct. So -- and we haven't even got the equipment yet here from -- to utilize some of the ISO containers, which will help this conversion even more. So all in, yes, I mean, they're a great team, really smart people, extremely enthusiastic and excited about this opportunity so far. I think Sean is probably better to mediate between Lance's [ph] view of growth in mind. On the question of succession, clearly, it's been a topic since I got here starting in the beginning of 2018. You may recall, there's been quite a significant change in the management makeup here over that four-year period. And it has always been my goal and has always been the goal of the Board to make sure that we had in place a rock-solid diligent succession planning process and the procedure to follow for all of the executive management jobs. And I think when you talk on the call today and you heard these great new voices that are, so doing such an exceptional job, that's because of the diligence that went into making sure that we always have an available pipeline of qualified talent. And I could tell you from working with the Board, that's no different from my job. Our job and the Board's job is to make sure when Jim decides to go whenever that might be. Hopefully, it's when I decide not when they decide. But whenever we're going to fill that job that we have qualified people, both internally and externally that can step right in and being a significant shareholder, I hope you can do a better job than I think I have done. Maybe other people disagree, but it's been an interesting ride. I think we had probably planned on doing another Investor Day, at least a year ago, if not longer. But I don't really -- I personally have not felt that it's really that useful via teams or via Zoom and have every time we've kind of talked about getting out to New York or doing something here or whatever it is, something else comes along and kind of puts the kibosh on our plans. So as soon as Tom Waterwood gets here and tells me when the pandemic is going to end, then we'll schedule it up and get out and talk to all of you. I'd love to show this team off, they're fantastic. Well, you'll see that number we publish; we publish our velocity as well every week. And that's a good proxy for understanding of how fluid the railroad network is, whether you're trying to look at it from a service standpoint, a customer perspective and where we in terms of trip plan compliance or how much extra cost we're having out there because we're running slow. In the region, we run slow. It is not that the locomotives moving at a lower rate of speed, it's sitting someplace because it gets to a terminal where it's supposed to be recruited and there is nobody; we don't have an employee to get on the train because he got sick. And so, as that velocity number increases, as that drone number goes down, the result is that our customer performance metrics or our trip plan compliance numbers will just improve over time. Well, on the customers, we have -- for good or bad, and yes, maybe this -- the last two years has caused us to rethink everything because things that we never thought were possible to happen, have happened. So we look at -- I think we look at the world differently. Our relationships with our customers is -- this is a big business. It's a big business. Our -- we have relatively long term, not as long as some contracts. But a couple of three-year duration with a customer who is making huge capital investments in these plants, in order to produce and has to have some level of longer-term reliability on what is transportation costs are going to be for them to be able to plan how to run its business. So trying to change that is difficult. I think every -- and again, our customers are reasonable people. So I think there's dialogues about what works there's always what works for both. It's a partnership arrangement in terms of how we help our customers be successful in these markets. In some circumstances, it may have accelerated our views to a certain degree in terms of -- there's been a modification. There's certainly been a change in the e-commerce arena about who buys themselves transportation in the marketplace. And so, we're dealing in certain circumstances more directly with the customers as it worked with third parties in -- that we did in the past and I think that's something that probably will evolve and continue to change. In terms of working with how we interact and how we contract with people that want to work for us, I think this is a big challenge and a huge opportunity for us to really upfront address what we think the worker who wants to work for the railroad is, what's the profile of that individual, not six months from now and not a year from now, but five years and 10 years from now. And how do we evolve for this industry in an extremely again, in most circumstances, how would you do this differently? How can you do this better? We can't put kiosks in place to do the work of a conductor or an engineer. But there's certainly technology out there that would allow us to do things more effectively, easier and probably with fewer employees. But we also work in an extremely heavily unionized environment that is also very heavily regulated with at times bent on telling us how we should do things. So we're always in the middle of going through the process and but yes, it's opened our eyes, and I think it's opened everybody's eyes in the transportation business about what we need to do to be more effective and handle these types of issues in the future. No. You bet. As it relates to the other railroads' filings in the CP and KCS deal, I'm not surprised at all, but the other railroads, some of the other railroads have weighed in with the requests to make sure that their franchises and their customers primarily are protected. And each railroad has its own unique requests and that process is just starting. We're just -- we didn't get involved in the substantive conversation around what the impacts are of that transaction. You may have seen that we took the position with the FTB that we didn't have enough information basically yet to formulate an opinion. So until we have gone on the record, so to speak, with what it is, what it is that we're going to ask for and we're still kind of looking at what it is we're going to ask for and what do other people ask for and what does that mean that sort of thing? It's really -- I'm not going to comment on any specific filing that any other railroad that made yet. Again, I'm not going to characterize anything. No. Like I said, it's not probably would be a comment really one way or the other where I thought it was aggressive or not aggressive or it's -- we're trying to figure out what everybody is doing and that takes time. It's a long, long, long process here for us to gather information, for us to look at everything, and then we'll formulate what we think is the right thing for CSX to do. And then at that point in time, we'll be in a better position to comment on what I think about whatever everybody else asked for."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. Fourth quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 4% on 3% lower volume as the impact of ongoing automotive semiconductor shortages was more than offset by revenue growth across all other merchandise markets. Industrial and construction-related end markets continued to demonstrate the strongest growth. Even though declines in energy-related markets remain a headwind for our chemical business, it's important to highlight that our core chemical, plastics and waste markets continued to show solid year-over-year growth. Intermodal revenue increased 16% on flat volumes as international growth driven by strong underlying demand and continued growth in rail volumes from East Coast ports was offset by domestic declines into ongoing driver and equipment shortages. Coal revenue increased 39% on 2% lower volume. Increases in export coal shipments, driven by the impact of rising benchmark prices, was partially offset by the effect of declines in domestic volumes, largely related to producer outages. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage, driven by supply chain disruptions, resulting from truck driver shortages, chassis availability and the lack of warehouse capacity. As we exited the fourth quarter, we clearly saw the effects of Omicron, with December volumes impacted by labor and supply chain disruptions. These challenges have continued into the New Year where we are seeing customers face labor shortages in their operations. As we look across merchandise, intermodal and coal markets, demand signals remain strong. As supply chain challenges normalize, we would expect volumes to align more with demand. Finally, I would like to highlight the positive results we have achieved by working with customers on new business development projects. Over the last few months, we have seen three significant announcements of new production of facilities to be located on CSX Railroad, including two electric vehicle plants and a new steel mill. These projects are team effort and show the ability of sales and marketing team and partnership with operations to creatively come up with solutions that meet the requirements of our customers. Importantly, these projects represent significant long-term value to CSX. Now let's discuss the progress CSX is making when it comes to our commitment to sustainability as summarized on Slide 6. Rail is the most efficient form of land-based transportation and CSX is the most fuel-efficient Class 1 railroad, U.S. Class 1 railroad. By using CSX Rail in 2021, our customers avoided 11 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking 2.3 million passenger vehicles off the road, an amount greater than all the hybrid and electric vehicles operating in the U.S. today. We are proud of the recognition we have received for these efforts to date by organizations such as CDP, Dow Jones, and Forbes, but we are certainly not done. CSX continues to invest in existing technologies to drive further improvement and we continue to evaluate emerging technologies, so we are prepared to realize those benefits when available. We are excited to see our customers increase focus on improving their carbon footprint. Customer engagement on ESG has accelerated and then we have seen them double their usage of CSX provided tools that help them calculate emissions savings from switching to rail. You will also see later this quarter, we will be recognizing customers for their efforts in prioritizing carbon emission savings by converting traditional truck volume to rail. I will now pass it on to Jaime to discuss our operations. Yes, thanks, Brian. Look, there's a lot of demand tail winds that we see. There's pretty robust demand across pretty much every end market currently, so we're optimistic there. As Sean pointed out that supply chain challenges and I think the timing of those normalizing is probably the biggest question as we move into second, third or fourth quarter kind of when does that really translate into some more, better fluidity out there for us. But starting with merchandise, really, it's a story of auto, when did the autos really start to -- production really start to come back online. When you look at our current estimates, it's really for a back half story on the volume and certainly autos drives more than just the current car loads in the auto side such as the metals business, plastics business for us as well. So auto is going to be very, very important. Certainly, we all know the demand. We've all been to the local dealership and they do not have any new cars. If you want a new car you've probably got to wait 12 months, so that's - the demand is there. There is no question about it. What we see right now, the metals business is very strong. Plastics remains very, very strong. Probably the only thing that we're really seeing weak and I touched on a little bit is the energy market and then that's all about spreads. And spreads can collapse and then get out again, so we'll continue to watch those and we'll benefit if those get more positive in the future. On the intermodal side, we've really benefitted from the international market and we see no slowdown at this point. There's still a lot of ships waiting at the port to get in and we've been very successful in moving that freight and we continue to have the operations and I think we'll continue to benefit from that. The domestic side is really where we've seen a disruption and that's been largely due to the driver shortage, the equipment shortages that we're seeing on the chassis side. And to be honest, I think the chassis problem seems to be being pushed out every month. I know the suppliers are having a hard time ramping up production, but that's probably going to be a second half story in terms of the chassis as far as we see it right now. So - but we do see the underlying demand there and I think that's a good positive story for us into the back half of the year. And then finally, when moving to the coal. The demand is outstripping supply. You see it in the exports benchmark prices, they are incredibly strong right now. We're at an all-time highs almost and when you look at the net and thermal markets today. And so we have some opportunity there. The mines had struggled quite frankly. They are underinvested. They had a hard time ramping back up production. Some have dealt with strikes. Some have dealt with other problems. And so those things should normalize hopefully and we should see the benefit of that. We've also seen recently a new mine come on line and so that should help us as we get through the year. But those, I think the biggest question is how long do the export prices stay at this levels? But we would expect hopefully volumes to pick up as we move through the year. Those are some of the moving parts due to the markets. Yes, coal levels, particularly in our Southern utilities are very low. So there's restocking as needed. We're working really closely with our customers, and I would expect that to persist through this year and probably in the next. Yes. So let me cover the pricing side first, and obviously, we're going to get this question. The market is -- clearly, there's tight from the supply chain from the transportation side. You've seen our primary competition, truck rates are up significantly, and we're having to react to that, obviously, in what we're doing, but also working with customers on opportunities for them to convert more freight over to rail. In this high inflation market, they're looking for ways that they can save on their transportation costs and rail is almost every time the most economical solution for them. And so those discussions, I'm happy to say are really accelerating now and talking to Jamie every day on what we can do. So that's a really real positive for us. So I would say, certainly, the market is better than it was last year. We're working with customers. They understand the cost pressures that are out there across the world, they're seeing it. They're asking their customers for the same. So we're seeing some positive momentum on that side. In terms of coal, I mentioned it in my opening remarks, export coal prices benchmarks are at highs. What we've assumed and your guess is probably as good as mine is that will moderate through the year. But what I can tell you is, if the economy reaccelerates post Omicron and China demand continues to be strong, then who knows it could last much longer. But what our assumption is going forward is that likely those prices will come down, so that will impact the yields somewhat into the back half of the year. But offsetting that somewhat we would expect maybe some volume progress as the producers ramp up some of their production as one of the new coal mines that I mentioned comes online as perhaps one of the coal mines that we serve resolve their strike and there's another major mine that we have right now that's shut down completely. So hopefully, some of those things come back online and help us on the volume side. Yes, we see about 50% to 60% renewed annually and about, call it, 75% of those in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Yes. Yes. And then on the coal RPU, we would expect something probably flattish in first quarter versus fourth quarter. Mix always matters. I would say the mix in terms of our domestic coal side should we see some of the supply issues at the mine and prove could help some of that southern coal longer haul pull maybe later here in the quarter that could help, but largely flat is the way we see it today. Hey, this is Kevin. I'll take this one. Clearly, yes, we had some strong performance. Some of that, obviously, was due to the impact of fuel surcharge. We see that probably being a favorable impact into the first quarter and probably less so as you move into the back half of the year and just face tougher comparisons there. There's a couple probably larger swing items we've talked about quite a bit already but the export coal side will be a large swing item into the second half of the year if prices and the benchmark prices remain. That will obviously be a good impact. We've talked about how we reprice 50% to 60% of our business every year, and so you'll start to see that impact start to flow through probably more heavily in the back half of the year. And then on, those are probably the major moving parts across the business and obviously mix always matters. If intermodal is outgrowing your merchandise side of your business, that's always a negative mix. So we would, we would expect merchandise to remain strong, but intermodal has proven over the last few years to be outgrowing merchandise, which is a good thing, but can have a negative impact on the overall RPU. Yes. I wish I had a crystal ball. There's one particular mine that keeps on telling us that they're going to come back online, and it seems to get pushed out every week. And so, no I don't have a lot of visibility, I have probably more confidence that as we get into the second, third, fourth quarter that we'll see some pickup there. The good news is they have a lot more cash to reinvest in their business, whether it's equipment and other things. So I would think we'll see some benefits of that as well. I mentioned one particular customer dealing with the strike. Those things have continued for quite a while, but eventually those things get resolved as well. The other one, the mine that I mentioned that's coming online, it will be a slow ramp-up, and we would expect more volumes in the second half and that's mainly into the export market. So we're positive there. We're -- it's a supportive market obviously, and we're going to look for opportunities to move more coal as we get more crude availability into the second half. On the contract side, nothing has really changed. We're obviously working with customers to create more even cadence through the rail network and I work with Jamie all the time, and we go out to customers and explain the challenges that they create and they can create more ratability of their volumes through our system. That's extremely helpful. And so working with them a lot on that side, so that's a big opportunity there. And then what was the first part of the question? Okay, yes. On the intermodal side, I think having spoken to you recently just one of our many customers; I think consumer behavior is actually going the other way. The expectation is not that they necessarily need something next day. So I would say, the emphasis on speed is actually going the other way to some degree, and we're seeing conversations around maybe I don't need to move it over a truck and get it there in 24 hours, that 48, 72-hour option is valuable. It's obviously cost effective, where a lot of our customers are looking to offset very, very high prices. I would say, on the domestic side, really the challenge has been equipment. It's not a lack of demand. We get calls every day. They want to put more volume on us. But if they can't get the volume out of the terminal, that's a problem. And that's what we've been dealing with. But we think that will resolve itself. It's obviously going to be easier to get truck drivers that you can get home at night that are doing the short haul, and that really plays into our sweet spot. The long-haul truckers aren't there. And I don't think that the drivers are going to come back to that market, but we do think the shorter haul drivers are going to become more and more available. But it's not just the drivers, it's the chassis, and we know there's a lot of orders out there, and so that will resolve itself. And then the container side, a lot of containers being ordered right now. So we do think as we get into the second half, we'll have a lot of tailwinds that will help us really accelerate growth."

            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie and good afternoon. As you've heard, operating income grew double digits up $151 million, with revenue up 21% on gains across all major markets. Over the line, interest and other expense was $60 million favorable, reflecting the prior year debt repurchase expense. Income taxes were up on higher pretax income though we recognized $25 million in benefits this quarter, primarily related to state tax adjustments. As a result, EPS of $0.42 is up 27% versus the prior year. Now, I'd like to take a minute to walk through operating expense in more detail on the next slide. Total costs increased $451 million or 28% in the quarter. the addition of Quality Carriers drove approximately $200 million of the increase. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor driving costs up to about $115 million versus last year. Non-locomotive fuel inflation remained consistent with prior quarters just above 3%, though as we turn the page to 2022, we expect a number around 4%. Drilling into a few specific line items, labor and fringe increased $115 million or 20% in the quarter. Quality was about $30 million. Incentive compensation was a nearly $40 million headwind in the quarter, largely due to higher expected payouts versus last year, and the impact of accelerated expense for certain employees. As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. We invested over $20 million in new programs targeting our T&E workforce. In line with these efforts, average headcount increased by 230, or 1% sequentially. Labor inflation remained in line with prior quarters, though is expected to be slightly higher in 2022. Purchase services and other expense increased $198 million or 44% in the quarter. As a reminder, this is where most of the quality expense shows up, approximately $130 million. Also, you may recall that we expected investments in supply chain fluidity to result in higher costs on this line and we saw about $45 million of increased expense as we work tirelessly to drive network and terminal fluidity in light of unprecedented challenges. We expect these costs will persist until we see a normalization of labor and the broader supply chain. The remaining increase reflected both the impact of inflation as well as a number of smaller items. Depreciation was up 4% on a higher asset base. Fuel costs were up on higher price and trucking fuel. Rents were up slightly, and we had about $20 million of higher real estate gains. Going forward, you can expect a modest level of base real estate gains, similar to the $35 million we recognized in 2020 as we shift our focus towards leveraging the real estate portfolio to support growth initiatives. However, the Virginia transaction will continue to impact results in 2022 with a $20 million gain in Q1, and a $120 million gain expected in Q2. We anticipate receiving the final $125 million of cash in Q4. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 11. On a full year basis free cash flow before dividends increased 45% to $3.8 billion. As a reminder, this includes $400 million from Virginia, and over 500 million of total proceeds from property dispositions. Cash in short term investments finished the year at $2.3 billion. While this remains elevated, we nevertheless expect to continue to work the balance down this year levels more in line with our historical liquidity needs. After fully funding capital investments, shareholder returns exceeded $3.7 billion. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Yes, thanks, Brandon. This is Sean. So just to clear the record, so you're going into full year 2022, we're going to have the full year impact of Quality and have lower real estate gains, as I just outlined, that together is about a 350 basis point impact. So on a like-for-like basis, you're starting at a 59 OR. Fundamentally, nothing has really changed about our story, right? Our expectation, as we come out of the pandemic this year, is for supply chains to normalize. As they do that, some of this - some of the costs that we've added in order to better serve our customers will start to come down a little bit. Obviously, the incremental growth that we see, stronger in the second half than in the first half of the year, should be at good incremental margins. And so at the end of the day, I think the core story that you've seen over the last couple of years with us is the same next year or this year, as it's been. The only unknown is what's the pace of the normalization? How do we get -- how quickly do we overcome what we're seeing right now out there in the environment. I don't know about that, but I can just kind of give you a little bit of color, which I think Kevin really sort of already went through in terms of each of the markets and the puts and takes there. But I think the first half of the year or first quarter, at least on the auto side, we're going to continue to remain challenged. So and you can see it in our weekly numbers in terms of how that's trending. So the hope is that as we get into the second half of the year, that's part of kind of what drives the above GDP growth. Kevin also talked about some of the growth initiatives and the three he mentioned aren't the only three. Obviously, there's a lot going on within the sales and marketing team in terms of attracting new business to the railroad. And then fundamentally, our ability to capture the demand picture that's out there, assuming that the recent momentum we've had on the hiring front continues, and the tools that we're using in terms of retaining the employees we have continue to be successful, we grow the active T&E count, we're going to be able to move more volume. Amit, this is Sean. I'll take the first two to begin with. So on your operating ratio question, you've got the 58.1 full year impact of Quality. So what I was saying is that kind of takes you to a 59. So I think your question is, can we do better than that in 2022? And we're not going to give OR guidance today. And -- but that being said, I think we've kind of walked through all the factors that are going to drive growth, both in terms of our volumes, our revenues as well as operating income and what that means for OR. We go into the year with a little bit of an elevated cost profile. Probably in Q1, you're going to see costs that are largely similar to Q4, given that things have not gotten better from a supply chain and labor availability perspective. As we go through the year, we think that does improve. And if it does, then we also see volumes come along with it. And we think that sets us up very, very well. There are other uncertainties. What happens in the coal market with export coal pricing and other factors like Kevin talked about. And then the other piece of it that you hit on was the other revenue, I think largely other revenue is going to trend with the broader supply chain because the issues that we're facing that are causing containers to dwell on the intermodal side are the same factors that we're facing more broadly in the economy between driver availability, chassis availability and so on. And so it's likely other revenue is going to remain elevated here in the first quarter. And then I would say our baseline expectation is that it begins to normalize starting next quarter and then hopefully sort of back to normal by the second half of the year, which means we're probably moving more volumes, so those are the factors. Hi Ben, this is Sean. I'll take your first question around the CapEx and I would say CapEx is up about $200 million versus 2021. About half of that is related to growth investments. So Jamie talked a little bit about the sidings already, which set us up very well for the long-term to grow into the capacity that he'll be creating. We're making some incremental investments on the technology side. Some of the Quality investments in the ISO tanks fall into that category and then some commercial facilities. So lots of good high-return growth-oriented investments. The balance of the increase in capital is really driven by sort of inflation in the core infrastructure spend as well as slight increase in hardening the core infrastructure for safety and reliability. Yes, Justin, it's Sean. I can take both of those. So the Quality impact is pretty straightforward. What you saw in the second half of this year, both in terms of revenue and expense is probably a pretty good run rate going into the next year into 2022, will have kind of a happier impact in Q1 and Q2 and then as we get into the back half, it should be pretty similar. The things that are going to drive any difference would really have to do with driver availability. The demand is very strong on the Quality side, but that's how I would think about it. So, a little over $400 million of revenue in the second half of this year. That's probably a good run rate around $200 million a quarter. In terms of sequential labor headcount, so you saw an increase of 1% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. I think that's probably a pretty good estimate of what we might see over the next couple of quarters. The good news is, as Jamie talked about, the head count we report to you includes both T&E employees who are in training as well as those that are marked up in revenue service. The mix between those that are in training and in service will change a little bit over the course of the first half year, which is great news. But the headcount should go up very modestly on a sequential basis over the first couple of quarters here. Scott, so comp per employee, you're right, it was elevated here in the fourth quarter, and that was one of the big factors there obviously was the incentive comp piece. So that should normalize as we get into 2022. I think if you look at it, excluding that for the back half of this year, that's probably a good baseline to build off of. We're going to have some higher labor inflation, which includes health costs as well as payroll tax and railroad unemployment. That will be partially offset by the incentive comp and then there's some favorable mix from the Quality addition in the first half of the year. Hopefully, as we get later into the year and the network is cycling better, we also see a reduction in overtime and things like that. So they're probably as a result of inflation, there will be a modest increase versus the normalized comp per employee, but not significant. And then in terms of purchase services, that's a line that has a lot of different moving pieces. What I can tell you is that you're probably going to see something similar in the first quarter to what you saw in the fourth quarter. But a lot of the costs that we added recently have to do with offsite storage and intermodal facilities, supplemental labor, adding some locomotives things like that. And that ties directly to overall fluidity within not only our network but the broader supply chain. So as that gets better, the purchase services costs should come down commensurate with that. Yes, that's correct. I think it's --- that's right. That's right. Now probably accessorial may come down a little bit faster than purchase services just as -- just from a timing perspective, but they will trend together."

            "name": "Jamie Boychuk",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Jim referenced, we are working very hard to provide customers the capacity to help overcome the persistent supply chain challenges. One of the areas we have discussed in our ongoing T&E hiring initiatives, this effort is beginning to pay dividends as more employees finish training and begin moving freight. We are also encouraged to see ongoing hiring momentum at the start of the year as we continue to consistently fill weekly training classes, while maintaining a strong pipeline of candidates. In total, we roughly doubled the average number of active trainees in the quarter. Also, the number of employees qualifying and moving to active status increased almost 50% sequentially in the fourth quarter to approximately 150. And we expect this number to double to over 300 employees in the first quarter. Recently, the benefit of these additional employees have been offset by the rapid rise in COVID cases across the network. Average daily cases have increased by several 100 employees since early November and are approaching prior peak levels. That said, there is no doubt that the hiring actions taken to date have allowed us to better manage the current situation. We have also supplemented this hiring by bringing additional assets online to help offset network imbalance caused by pockets of concentrated case counts. We will maintain these tactical asset increases as needed to protect service. We will look to improve asset utilization and drive increased operating efficiency as employees return to work and our ongoing hire initiatives provide the necessary resources to move incremental volumes and deliver the expected high-quality service to our customers. Additionally, until along the way capacity improves in intermodal terminals, we will continue making the necessary investments to keep terminals fluid by providing the overflow space and supplemental labor required to move long dwelling boxes out of our terminals. We're also continuing to take a long term approach to network and infrastructure planning, and have identified several strategic exciting extension opportunities that will provide additional long-term capacity by helping to alleviate congestion, while also supporting growth for years to come. As always, we will pursue these initiatives while maintaining a balanced train plan and a continued focus on strong execution to maximize both reliability and service for our customers. I want to thank the entire operating team for their hard work and long hours they've put in to keep freight moving for our customers. Despite the incremental headwinds this quarter, service metrics remained consistent with the prior quarter and we are taking the necessary steps to drive these metrics back towards pre-pandemic levels over the course of 2022. Turning to Slide 8, safety remains fundamental to everything we do at CSX and we hold ourselves to the highest standard for our employees, customers, and the communities in which we work and operate. Our hard work to instill a culture of safety at CSX continues to drive positive results, as shown by the reduction in our train accident headcount this -- train accident rate this year. Heading into 2022, we continue to target further reductions in human factor incidents through a combination of increased awareness, best practice sharing, collaboration across regions, and expanding our successful drone program. We are also engaging with our new hires to instill our principles of safe operations and emphasize our commitment to make CSX the safest running railroad. I will now hand it to Sean to review our financial results. Yes. I think Jim pretty much nailed it. This is probably one of the most difficult environments we've ever seen. When you think about all the stuff the rail industry has gone through over the past 10, 20 years, my 25 years of railroading, I can tell you, when you come in one week and you've got 60 people off on COVID a new variant comes through, and you've got 350 off on COVID on your T&E side, you really start to feel the effects. And believe me, Kevin and I are talking all the time about the opportunities of moving as much product as we can for our customers. And not only just the product that we currently have with our current customers, but the growth side of things and what else can we move out there. So to Jim's point, our hiring classes of over, I would say, probably the past two months have been extremely successful. We are putting 150-plus T&E, well new conductors, I guess, through our training center in Atlanta and we continue every single week to hold a new class. And I'm proud to say that all the hard work our HR team has done through Diana Sorfleet is paying off. And honestly, when we start looking at where we're going to be in three or four months from now, we're going to be a different look in railroad and these opportunities that Kevin is talking about is going to be opportunities that we're going after. Jon, we are always analyzing the railroad. So I'm going out there again next week to spend some time on the railroad, and we'll be analyzing again what we're doing with our plan out there. So of course, as market conditions change, and other factors that go on out there, we analyze what we do. Yes, we just finished finding different opportunities to service our customers better, particularly in the Carolinas. We spent a lot of time out there just over this past quarter. But as I mentioned, we've put some assets out there in order to ensure that we can provide the service that our customers require right now. So there are some expenses that go along with that. And we see a quarter or two from now as our hiring catches up to where we need it to be, we'll be able to pull those assets back and/or use those assets for continued growth as we move forward. So there is -- there absolutely is always an opportunity on our railroad. The job of the folks out there, who are working really hard on the ground, their job is to execute. The network centers job is to analyze. And I work between those folks to make sure we're making the right decisions, and we'll continue to do that. So yes, there's always opportunities, but I can tell you right now, our focus is on growth. Our focus is on service and our focus is to make sure we continue to balance those expenses along the way. So that's going to be where we continue to push in towards 2022. I would just add on the CapEx side that the siding extensions we're looking at mostly on our L&M part of our property, which was down in the Southern, Southwestern part of the railroad where we had smaller sidings. It worked for us, but the growth coming out of some of that area through Alabama and other stuff that's going on, the need is there. So that's where the majority of this CapEx money is going to, and we're excited to get it out in that area to support that growth that Kevin and his group are bringing. With respect to Curtis Bay, yes, we were down for a couple of weeks, but we're back up doing direct dumping. We did redirect a few trains to a couple of different locations, but we are back in business. Thank you, Jason. I'd say, as you've followed probably quarter-to-quarter, it is a slow climb. We're working really hard on the service product. It really comes down to the availability of people. Our COVID numbers were down into October, November, where we had maybe 30 or 40, maybe up to 60 T&E employees and then towards the end of the year up to where we are today, well over 300 to 350 folks off. So for us to really get this service product where we're arriving on the hour, as we continue to commit to, it really comes down to people. And we've been saying this for probably over a year now as we've struggled to even get that pipeline going. Now we've got a great pipeline. We continue to fill those classrooms and the folks in Atlanta are doing an absolute amazing job under Jim Switzenberg [ph] and his team. It's all about producing conductors and as this quarter continues, we should see that number come up, but again I think Jim has mentioned couple of times, it all comes down to what happens in the world with respect to COVID or whatever the next pandemic or item might be that affects our crewing of our trains, so that for us is the dial that really turns us up and down when we think about our service product. Just touching, I think Sean talk a little bit about it. But look, we have 6% to 8% attrition per year. We have to remember that. So not only do we have to hire to cover attrition, we've got to hire to get that number where we need to be in our minds to be able to provide the service that's required and the growth that Ken and his group are going after. So I'll leave it -- I'll kind of leave it at this. We are actively hiring. We have over 500 conductor trainees right now between Atlanta and what's out in the field and we're not stopping. We're going to continue to get folks out there qualified as conductors. And we've got a round of qualifying for locomotive engineers here at some point within the next year or two. So -- but we want to make sure that we can provide that service and grow this company. No, no comments at this point."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q3 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nBill Slater: Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are James Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing. Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations, and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure. Followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide three. With that, it's my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer James Foote.\nJames Foote: Right. Thanks, Bill. And thank you to all who are joining us today for the call. I want to begin by thanking all of CSX 's employees for their extraordinary efforts to help our customers navigate the strained global supply chain. Across virtually every industry, there are challenges presented by extended lead times, port congestion, shortages of labor and key materials, and lack of storage capacity. While the current operating environment is challenging, we are not sitting idle. We are designing new solutions to help reduce congestion, adding container yards and drayage to keep intermodal terminals fluid. And we're investing in both people and network capacity to ensure CSX is able to reliably meet customer needs today and for years to come. In a few minutes, Kevin will go through the revenue numbers and discuss some of the steps we are taking to provide new service offerings to our customers, to help them overcome these challenges. And Jamie will provide an update of our hiring initiatives, as well as actions we are taking to keep our network fluid. So, let's first turn to the presentation and begin on slide 4 with an overview of our third quarter results. Operating income increased 26% to $1.44 billion. Earnings per share increased 34% to $0.43. And the operating ratio improved by 50 basis points to 56.4. These figures include the results of quality carriers which did not have a significant income -- impact on operating income. But increased third quarter operating ratio by approximately 250 basis points, excluding transaction and integration expenses. I'll now take it over to Kevin.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5, third-quarter revenue increased 24% year-over-year, with growth across all major lines of business. Inclusion of quality carriers, revenue represented roughly 8% points of the total increase. Supply chain challenges, including a lack of labor and equipment continued to impact almost every market we serve, driving volatility and freight flows and uneven volumes. Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volumes as higher revenue across all other markets was offset by declines in auto, driven by the ongoing semiconductor shortages. The industrial and construction related markets, such as metals and equipment or its products and minerals, all showed strong year-over-year volume growth. In addition, our core chemicals business grow, but was partially offset by declines in crude oil and other energy-related markets. Inter-modal revenue increased 14% on 4% higher volumes. Due to increased international shipments as a result of strong demand. Inventory replenishment, and growth in rail volumes from east coast ports. The domestic side was more challenged as multiple supply-side constraints, including container and chassis shortages, have resulted in the inability to meet the strong demand. Coal revenue increased 39% on 16% higher volumes, with growth across all end markets. Domestic coal benefited from higher utility and industrial demand, and export coal revenue increased from the combination of higher demand and higher export benchmark prices. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage due to the broader supply chain disruptions from truck driver shortages, chassis availability, and the lack of warehouse capacity. Turning to Slide 6. This is an extraordinary time as customers and global supply chain face challenges we have never experienced before. On trucks to chassis, supports to containers, lack of truck drivers, to labor challenges at the warehouse, and production facilities. We are seeing shortages everywhere. The entire CSX team has been highly focused on delivering new, innovative solutions and partnering with customers to address the supply chain challenges by driving more volume to the railroad. Across the network we have accelerated investments to create new capacity. To address the truck driver shortages, we have added 13 new overflow container yards, implemented new steel wheel options for West Coast cargo. And added Transflo sites that offer customers additional options to move their freight at a lower cost. To address the port congestion and container shortages we have added new solutions to accelerate repositioning of containers. We utilized port deport lanes to alleviate marine terminal congestion. We are working closely with partners, including GPA to utilize additional and Lynn rail yards to help reduce congestion at the port. We have also been aggressively expanding our customer solutions team to further supplement the significant investments we are making in customer facing technology. Our team is working diligently to create new solutions and options for shippers with supply chain disruptions unlikely to improve in the near term. Finally, we are starting to see early signs of customers making long-term investment decisions to reinvest in onshore production and supply chain solutions. To address these customer needs, we continue to develop and invest in new CSX select sites that offer shovel-ready CSX served solution to meet customer requirements. With that, I will hand it over to Jamie to discuss operations.\nJamie Boychuk: Thank you, Kevin. As noted, our teams are working closely together to find new ways to overcome the supply chain disruptions, and provide new solutions for our customers. In addition to the ongoing supply challenges, this past quarter was further impacted by a rising COVID mark cost due to the Delta variant. At peak, we had several hundred employees marked off, including regional concentrations that required us to adjust our network plan in real-time to get customers their freight. Despite these challenges, we are able to maintain network performance compared to the prior quarter. And we expect the initiatives we have underway to drive them... fluid going forward, Kevin touched on many of the things we're doing to help reduce congestion at the ports and keep containers moving. And I want to thank my inter modal team for the exceptional work they're doing to accomplish these goals. These efforts are highlighted by the nearly 90% inter modal trip line compliance. They continue to deliver in a challenging environment. We entered the year focused on hiring. The people required to respond to the rising demand. And I'm proud of how our team has been able to think creatively and act decisively to overcome the challenges presented by the tight labor market. Over the course of the year we have redesigned our recruiting process to eliminate unnecessary steps and significantly shorten the time from application to offer. We have also implemented new recruiting tools and referral programs that are improving our application through different conversation rates and better at identifying highly qualified candidates. These efforts have successfully increased the size and frequency of our conductor classes and provided strong ongoing higher visibility by expanding our new higher pipeline, almost 300% since July. We are also increasing intermodal headcount and supplemental labor to keep the terminals fluid and allow us to continue moving containers for our customers. While these hiring initiatives are underway, we're taking steps to increase the availability of our existing T&E workforce. We have implemented new attendance base initiative programs, which allows us to better utilize our existing headcount to move more freight for our customers. We're also making upgrades to our network to increase throughput and create additional capacity. We are installing more automated equipment at our hump yards. We're converting intermodal terminals to grounded facilities in order to increase capacity. And we are expanding our investment in autonomous cranes to increase intermodal terminal throughput. While we still have sufficient line of road capacity, we are strategically investing in growth by extending sidings in select locations across the network. These siding investments will allow us to continue to refine our train plan, and provide growth capacity for years to come. Every action we take is focused on network reliability that begins and ends with running a balanced train plan to minimize delay, and maximize network performance. Running a scheduled network ensures assets are in the right place at the right time. We will continue to maintain network balance and the principles of scheduled railroading as we add resources to meet current demand. These principles have allowed us to keep the intermodal network open and running well this year, and we are focused on continuing the strong performance as we enter into peak season. Turning to Slide 8. Maintaining a safe operation is the foundation to the success of any other operating goal we want to pursue, and we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the third quarter, personal injury rate improved sequentially, and ongoing safety initiatives also drove a decrease in injury severity. While train accident rate increased slightly from last quarter's record results, accidents rates have improved year-over-year. Focus for the remainder of the year will be critical rule compliance, and reducing human factor accidents. We are leveraging the approximate 9,000 tablets distributed to Field employees to more productively deliver these messages. Not only did the tablets allow real-time communication on key safety information, but we're also able to more effectively combine electronic and in-person communications to increase the impact of our training programs and drive lasting changes, and the behavior that will better protect our employees. I will now turn the call over to Sean for the financials.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Jamie. And good afternoon. Looking at the income statement on Slide 9, operating income grew nearly $300 million or 26%. Revenue was up 24%, reflecting gains across all major markets, higher fuel prices, and the impact of quality carriers. The operating ratio of 56.4% is a third quarter record for CSX. As we focus on operating efficiently and growing the business. As a reminder, this includes an impact of approximately 250 basis points from the ongoing operations of quality. Looking below the line, interest and other expense was 16 million favorable to last year due to a lower weighted average coupon, and lower average debt balances, as well as favorable pension impacts. An income tax expense was up on higher pre -tax earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%. Looking at expenses in more detail on the next slide, Total cost increased $349 million or 23% in the quarter. Including transaction-related expenses, approximately 200 million of the increase was driven by quality carriers. Higher locomotive fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about 90 million versus last year. Partially offsetting these items, real estate gains were 56 million higher. Non-fuel inflation remains steady versus last quarter at around 3%. As I mentioned last time, we have some lagging contracts that may drive higher inflation going into next year. As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. While head count was roughly flat sequentially, excluding the addition of quality carriers. The conductor count was up and was offset by reductions in other areas of the business. As a result, we experienced $16 million more in hiring and retention costs versus last year. You'll note that we have renamed the prior MS&O line to purchase services and other. The base expenses are identical to the prior MS&O category. But the new description better reflects the costs in this line post-acquisition. Increased costs on this line reflected the addition of quality, as well as higher intermodal terminal and locomotive expense. Depreciation was up on a higher asset base that also includes the acquisition impact. Finally, we're proud to report another all-time record for fuel efficiency in the quarter. This reflects continued focus and investment by CSX, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and the ongoing environmental advantage of rail. Looking into the fourth quarter, we typically see a seasonal increase in operating expense due to weather, lower capitalized labor, as well as holidays and vacations, that trend should continue this year. In addition to expected headwinds from higher incentive compensation and lower sequential gains on property sales in the fourth quarter. Peak-season expenses are also likely to be higher than normal as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Now, turning to cash flow on Slide 11. With operating income up 34% on a year-to-date basis. Free cash flow before dividends this year is $2.9 billion up nearly 50%. Free cash flow conversion on net income is exceeding 100% year-to-date. And we expect it to remain near this level on a full-year basis. The Company's cash balance of 2.2 billion is beginning to normalize. The lower balance reflects the acquisition in the quarter and a step-up in distributions to shareholders. We expect cash to continue to normalize over time. After fully funding capital investments in our core infrastructure, year-to-date shareholder returns have exceeded 2.9 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion in buybacks and over $600 million in dividends. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim, for his closing remarks.\nJames Foote: Great. Thank you, Sean. Concluding with Slide 12, we are maintaining a full-year outlook for double-digit revenue growth before the impact from quality carriers. We expect capital expenditures to be at the top end of our initial $1.7 to $1.8 billion range due to materials cost inflation, the capacity investments we just reviewed, and the inclusion of quality carrier\u2019s capital spending. I will conclude my remarks the same way I began. We are committed to helping our customers overcome the current supply chain challenges. And as you heard today, our entire team is aligned around this goal. And we will continue to act. We have a strong hiring pipeline, and we will hire until we have staffed the network to match demand. We expect to higher above attrition throughout the rest of this year and into next year. Economic demand remains strong and CSX will help customers capture that demand. Everything we do begins with a commitment to providing customers a high-quality service. We will build on the positive momentum from actions taken to date. We will continue putting resources in place to drive growth, and we will provide customers with creative new offerings that makes CSX a more meaningful part of the customer supply chain. Thank you, Bill.\nBill Slater: Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good afternoon. Congrats on some really solid results in a tough environment. Great to see. Maybe just a follow-up. Either Jim or Sean, just talking about your thoughts on pricing. I know you were running through some of the categories there. Maybe how much you can still address and some of the opportunities to catch this rising market, and obviously coal up 20%, it seems like you're touching some of that maybe even faster than thought, or there's different kind of moves, maybe just delve into the pricing outlook. Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you. And I'll take a shot at this, Kevin. I think it's clear that cost inflation over the last year, expectations have risen and our arising in the next year. And this is not surprising to our customers are facing the same cost inflation pressures that we see. and what we strive to do is be transparent around that in our conversations with customers. Fourth quarter and first quarter are heavy renewal periods for us, so we'll be having those discussions. But the exciting part though, as we get into a higher inflation environment, is really the value proposition we offer. When a customer is looking to offset some of that cost inflation, rail is just a great alternative. They shift more of their volumes over to rail. And then you add on top of that the persistent driver shortages that we're likely to see well into next year and probably the years ahead, the value proposition is there. Then on top of that, the environmental discussions that we're having increasingly with customers is really resonating with those. It's no surprise. Cost inflation is higher than what we saw last year. It will be a higher-cost inflation environment than what we probably seen in the last number of years. And we've got to have conversations with our customers around that.\nKen Hoexter: I guess, just a follow-up. Any detailed thoughts on kind of the trend of pure pricing, pace of acceleration, or any level of that detail?\nSean Pelkey: Well we get to touch, as I mentioned, contracts into the fourth and first 2 quarter, that's a heavy renewal period and we will continue to have those discussions. I think I will probably leave it at that.\nKen Hoexter: All right. Thank you very much, guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra. Your line is unmuted.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, can you just update us on the quality carriers\u2019 acquisition. The status of the revenue opportunity you're seeing converting some of those into chemical carloads. And just when we may see a more meaningful uplift, obviously that's a great offset to intermodal carloads [Indiscernible] growing just to [Indiscernible]it's a great idiosyncratic opportunity if you can just give us a little bit update there and then just any initial thoughts on margins or performance next year. Obviously, you've got a big pricing cycle ahead of you. Just any willingness to opine about. What the opportunities is from an OR perspective next year would be would be highly appreciated. Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Maybe I'll let Sean take the OR question, but I don't think we're giving guidance today on next year. But on the quality carriers, as you'll remember that, that really is focused on our chemical franchise and the customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive in a market where supply is constrained. Our customers were looking for more options to move their freight, and so Randy and his team combined with our Transflo team have found a number of options and we're moving freight today. Now that we're doing it in a way where it's thoughtful and calculated, and that the customer's seeing a good service on that product, and we'll continue to build momentum in the market. But I think everything that we thought before we made the acquisition is coming true. The only thing I will say is from a conquipment standpoint, obviously with things tight right now, the equipment backlog is going to take a little bit long in the next year to really ramp that up. When we think about some of the ISO tank solutions that we're contemplating out there. So other than that, everything is full speed ahead. I would say there's customers that we believe would be longer -- would take a lot longer to adopt, that have been first to adopt, which is exciting for us markets leaders in the industry, and their adoption I think is going to really set the tone for this to really take off into the market. The other thing that I think is positive is shows other partners that we have that we're capable of doing this using the Transflo solution in unique ways. And we don't always have to do it ourselves. We would love partners to continue to bring freight and through our all of our different capabilities that we have so I think that momentum is starting to be seen in the market as well.\nAmit Mehrotra: Sean, do you want to talk about the [Indiscernible] -- Maybe you can offer guidance, but maybe another way to ask it is -- there's obviously a lag on this coal. Coal revenue are to opportunities. Just wondering, are we going to see more uplift in coal yields in the fourth quarter as you -- as some of that lag gets caught up? Just talk to us maybe about the cadence because you don't want to answer though our question next year.\nSean Pelkey: Yeah, on the -- clearly on the export coal side, you've seen some favorability on the prices there. And as we've mentioned before, our prices tied to the benchmarks and you will see some favorability sequentially in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. It's a strong market. We continue to see favorability in the next year, how long it holds up at these levels that probably weren't held here. But these are extremely elevated levels that will probably carry into next year and hopefully create some favorability there. But it's a -- everybody is trying to produce more coal and we're trying to move more of it today. And at the mine, there's been some struggles here in the third quarter as you could see with some of the production hiccups that some of the producers have had. We're working through that as diligently as we can and really ramping up our ability to serve those customers.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay. Thank you very much, appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz. Your line is unmuted.\nTom Wadewitz: Good afternoon. I think this is probably for you Kevin, but maybe for others also. How do you think about the impact of capacity constraints on volumes? You think intermodal would have been meaningfully stronger, do you -- how much optimism do you have as you look forward that maybe into '22 that capacity constraints get alleviated quickly, and how does that inform your perspective on growth looking to next year? Is it reasonable to expect easing of constraints and a pretty good acceleration? I guess it's primarily around your remodel, but you may have capacity constrains other areas as well. Thank you.\nJames Foote: Hey, Tom, it's Jim. Let me take a shot. I would say yeah, we're clearly constrained. There was more business out there this quarter, there has been more business out there throughout this year that we could not handle. The primary reason for that is our inability, like everyone else in the world right now, to ramp up our workforce coming out of the steep declines of the early phases of the pandemic. And as Jamie talked about, we're now starting to see the fruits of all of our hard work for the last 9 months or more, and are beginning to bring on more people and actually deploy those people into the field so we're able to operate a little bit better. And we fully expect that that trend will continue as we go forward, unless some other crazy curve ball gets thrown at us. And being a much, much better position as we exit this year and move into next year, and hopefully be able to take advantage of what seems to be a continuation of strong demand for transportation services into 2022, I know some people are even saying 2023.\nTom Wadewitz: Do you think a lot of that is in your control or is it hard to have visibility given the warehouse labor, drayage labor, other pieces?\nJames Foote: My first -- the number 1 priority is getting enough CSX employees in the training -- principally conductors on the train so we can operate more fluidly and get back to some of the performance metrics that we were putting up pre -pandemic in the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020. The fluidity, the dwell, the on-time performance, the customer service metrics that we put out there, the trip plan compliance numbers, those numbers are all down, and that's principally a result of our having an extremely difficult time getting people to come to work for us. It's taken a complete I would say reengineering of the hiring process, a complete review of everything that we do when we onboard employees for us to get to this point. This is -- this has been extremely difficult we're no different than every -- every business at least in the U.S, every business I think. Every business, every hospital, every school, everybody is struggling with the same phenomenon of trying to get people to come to work. I am confident that we have done everything we can do right now and are seeing that numbers are increasing. In terms of the number of employees that we can put into our training programs and begin to qualify them to go to work. Like I said, unless something else comes along that disrupts that process, I hope we're going to be in a lot better shape at the end of this year, the beginning of next year than we have been over the last 9 months.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thanks for the insights, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good afternoon. Sean, I think you called out a few sequential headwinds to OpEx in the fourth-quarter. I believe it was incentive comp, slower gains on sale, and then some peak season expense. Any way you can put a finer point around those 3 items to just help us understand the order of magnitude here in the next quarter?\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. Thanks, Justin. You got the items right; higher incentive comp, lower gains on property sales, and then just some additional costs related to the supply chain. If you put all those together, you're probably looking at about a couple of pennies over and above what we would normally see from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.\nJustin Long: Okay. Very helpful. And then any thoughts on other revenue as well? I know it was pretty elevated and took a decent step up here sequentially X quality, but the thoughts on that into the fourth quarter and maybe in the next year?\nSean Pelkey: If you look just at the pure other revenue line, not considering the tracking revenue line which should -- tracking revenue should be pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter, really the big driver, as Kevin said there, is the intermodal storage and premise use charges as well as demurrage. And that's a direct result of what's going on in the supply chain that we've been talking about here. So as things start to improve, that line -- the other revenue line will come down. But here we sit in October, we're probably in about the same place as we are -- we were in Q3. And we'll see where it goes from here.\nJustin Long: Okay. I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. Just back on headcount. If you can get all the people that you'd like to get, I guess, 2 thoughts. One, how much -- it sounds like you want to be above attrition directionally. What kind of percentage increases in headcount are you thinking about, and is there a way to think about if you add back 5% to headcount, what do you think that means to volume growth and things like that? Do you still think you can grow volume in excess of headcount? Just to understand the spreads there, and thanks. Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Scott. So, what we're looking on a sequential basis is modest increases in headcount, right? We're bringing on -- trying to fill classes of 40 every week and then getting those folks trained up and out into the field. So, you're not going to see dramatic increases in headcount. I think it's also fair to assume that we've got capacity still on our existing trains and capacity on the network, so we are hiring for growth, but it's not -- it doesn't need to be one for one.\nScott Group: Okay. So, I didn't -- I probably didn't ask it so well, but do you think next year is a year where you could grow volume and excess of headcount?\nSean Pelkey: I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be the target.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.\nJames Foote: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Oglenski. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey guys, it's Brandon. I just want to ask a quick one about the fourth quarter cost commentary. I guess, I don't know if it was already asked, but does that mean that's going to be hard to show OR implemented in the near-term. Then I guess longer-term if I could sneak a two-part question. Kevin, what are some the structural things that you think you can leverage with the headcount, building off of Scott's question there?\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. Just on the OR question, we -- we're not going to give OR guidance, but I think it's fair to assume sequentially, given some of the cost pressures as well as just the normal seasonality, we'll probably see an OR that's a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.\nKevin Boone: Brandon, I guess the question was, what can we do with more headcount? The team is going to --\nBrandon Oglenski: Yeah, strategically.\nKevin Boone: Strategically, we're going to move a lot more freight. When we talk to customers right now, they 're are looking for capacity, and they're trying to offset a lot of cost inflation too. The environment couldn't be any better for us to go out and sell the product we have. So, we're going to move more freight and we're going to get more wallet share with the customer. It's a perfect environment for us.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right, thanks, Kevin. Thanks, Sean.\nOperator: Your next line comes from the question -- your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Jamie just wanted to ask if bigger picture question about just capacity and interplay with the regulators in DC. See what your peers put out there later this week and next week. But it looks like you have some obviously, a lot of capacity solutions here that you're ramping up on your own. Do you think you need additional help on that for some of your supply chain partners, and maybe some perspective on what you can do on your own versus where you need help with? And then just contrasting that with obviously the big other revenue you just mentioned, clearly the demurrage is a cost everybody at this point, but there have been some fairly pointed comments out of the STB about growing and focusing maybe less on OR than on growth. So maybe you can address all that in terms of adding capacity if need help. And what the regulators you think will take away from all this? Thank you.\nJames Foote: I think Kevin did a very good job of outlining all of the activities that we've been undertaking here over the last 6 months or so to do on our own without any prodding to improve and increase capacity. We were way ahead of the curve. The -- Chicago, the biggest terminal for us in terms of intermodal capacity, expanding our 59th Street facility, we bought that property two years ago. We had it -- we had another yard right down the street, which was ready to go, cranes available. So, we've always tried to be somewhat visionary in trying to determine where the growth would be and make sure that we were properly positioned. Some of these new initiatives, like Kevin talked about moving traffic inland from Savannah into a facility in Atlanta, we had a yard available there, wasn't an intermodal yard, we created an intermodal yard. And so, we're taking the steps that we think are appropriate and necessary in order to make sure that our railroad continues to operate more fluid and provide better service all the time. That's always been the case, it will always be the case, and that's -- whether that's mainline track that moves merchandise, business, or whatever it is, we're always being thoughtful in our planning process to make sure that we have the capacity available to handle a traffic growth as it comes on. The lucky fact is that we over the last 4 years, by changing the methodologies we use to run the railroad, have freed up an enormous amount of capacity across the rail network, just simply by running the trains on a more reliable and efficient manner. And so, we don't need to make big, big, big investments in the railroad in order to handle future growth. We've you got locomotives in storage, so we're ready to go. I had thought, I believe it was on a year-end conference call in January, where I called out the fact that we were going to be hiring. I fully believed, in as much as at that point in time we had about 300 of our trainees and service employees off one COVID, that we would just simply do what we've always done; we'd hire 500 employees. The 300 employees would come back from off sick, and we'd be rocking and rolling and we've been moving freight. No one -- no one ever gave me a heads up that says, by the way when you want to hire somebody, nobody is going to want to work for you. Plus, all the people that you head furloughed as the railroad had this trafficked decline so dramatically. So many more than was usual when we call them back and said you want to come back to work they said no, I've decided to go do something else. I've changed my lifestyle. I'm going to go enjoy the scenery on the Jersey course -- coast or whatever it might be. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to CSX. This is a phenomenon that nobody saw coming, and it is a phenomenon that everybody in the supply chain, whether you're a trucker, whether your steamship Company, whether you're a port, whether you're a warehouse operator, whatever you do, this is a phenomenon that is impacting everyone and everyone is trying to deal with this -- what is now the new norm. So, we've had to change everything the way we think about it, and that's -- but have done that. As we always do, we adapted, we recognized this -- the situation, we adapted and we made changes, and that's why we're reasonably confident that we'll be in better shape as we move forward this year and in pretty good shape as we move in to next year. I don't need the -- I don't need any help from the government in order to figure out what I'm supposed to do, I just don't want to make sure the government does something that screws it up worse.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Understood. Thanks, Jim, and if I could sneak one quick one in, all the stuff on Page 6, do you think that would be permanent going into the future of these things you had pulled forward from prior plans, or do you think this is more of a case of reacting to what we see here? Thank you.\nJames Foote: I think we're -- what we're doing is we're responding the situation, that's simple as that. We can think, we can plan, we can do all kinds of things. Unfortunately, I think we've had more black swan events in the last 2 years than most people would experience in a lifetime. So, as I said, what's the next thing? I am -- I started off my remarks telling -- saying how proud I was of our employees. All of this going on, all of these challenges, all of these changes, all of these demands, all of these people saying first of all Jesus, you know, the entire supply chain issue was as a result of the railroads. Oh my God, the railroads screwed this thing up. Then as time went on, everybody figured out it's not really the railroads. We don't own the warehouses where this stuff goes, we don't have the trucks to bring it there. If I need to buy a truck and bring it there, I'll bring it there and I'll put the box in the warehouse parking lot, going to be somebody else's problem. But most of the issues associated with everything that is talked about, the railroads are doing an extremely good job. Their employees have been critical of workers throughout the entire pandemic have been out there working, and not been home in the basement, have been complying with all the requirements and making sure that the economy keeps growing. And so, the railroad guys, not just CSX, but could be entire railroad industry's been an up phenomenal job under unbelievably difficult circumstances.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thank you, Jim. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee. Your line is open.\nChristian Wetherbee: Thanks, afternoon, guys. Jim, I think you mentioned on the call that the quality impact was more than 200 basis points on the operating ratio, and so I guess it sort of struck me that you guys are running sort of the core rail business at an operating ratio I really haven't seen before. And I guess in the context, and I understand the pricing environment, particularly on the assessorial side is certainly elevated, and that probably has some impact on how we should be thinking about operating ratio. But maybe big picture as we think forward. You are growing volume arguably better than your peers, pricing is going to be a cycle here for a period of time, and you're talking about bringing some folks back, but service is good. Can we talk a little bit about maybe we need to think about a new way to think about OR over the long run? I guess I just want to make sure I understand what this business is capable of in terms of incremental margins and the ability to take on some of these new freights and these new opportunities, what seems to be very, very good margins going forward.\nJames Foote: Yup, you did the math, and yeah, that was excluding some of the transaction costs and some other things too. So, it's pretty simple math. Yeah, the railroad is running efficiently. When we stretch, as we've always said this a million, million times. This is not about all OR, this is not about how low can we go, how many heads can we take out. When we run the railroad good, when we stretch, like we're doing right now, and the reason we're stretching is because we're trying every single hour of every single day to move our customers' freight. And when you do that, and you've focused on getting it there as quickly as you can and efficiently as you can. It results in unfortunately not a perfect service product, but a very good service product in difficult times. You do it efficiently. And as a result of that, the score adds up that's says you got a low operating ratio, but that's not the goal that's just a result. And so yes, we run up a pretty good number. I would've preferred to do a lot more business as we said, we could have. And we try to do every single day, we try to move more freight. Kevin is out there right now, constantly trying to figure out how you can provide solutions to our customers. Our goal here is to move more freight. That's what we do. We move freight, and the more freight we move, the more revenue you pour in the top, the more efficiently you operate is simple is that, it's just math. So, think about what they -- think about, you want to worry about what the operating ratio was? Think about what the operating ratio could be for the railroad industry if they were able to grow more than it's historically grown. Then you can start talking about what the operating ratios might be, stop thinking about how much cost you can take out.\nChristian Wetherbee: Okay. That's helpful color, thanks very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Jim, as you alluded to earlier, you've been talking about hiring to support growth since January. Certainly, doubled down that on that in July and it's been a big topic today. But at this point, it doesn't feel like our U.S. competitors are talking as much about labor and some of the challenges there that they're having as you are today. And maybe why that's a messaging difference rather than a fundamental difference. You've got a letter from the STB on Monday, about CSX service specifically. So, can you help us understand, is there something different with your situation with labor versus your other public peers in the U.S.? Is it the messaging difference, just anything to help us unscramble this would be helpful? Thank you.\nJames Foote: Yeah well, I'm trying to unscramble it for myself, and I've said from the very beginning of this year, that we had a challenge in terms of hiring. We needed to hire, I thought we would be able to hire like we always had. We aren't able to hire like we always did, and we've said that now for 3 quarters. You have my metrics as reported to the STB in terms of all of the railroads, whether it'd be velocity, whether it'd be dwell, my service metrics are continuing to lead in most areas. So, the railroad here is still running better than most. During that period of time, where we were finding out that a lot of people wanted to make career choices and leave the Company that we hadn't expected, we were having the difficulties that everybody else was having during that period of time. We were the epicenter of the world in terms of the pandemic here in Jacksonville. So, I think we got probably hit during that period of time a little more severely the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi have had a little rougher time, and I'm not calling out any reasons why that might be, that's just the facts. And so, while we have been saying publicly, we are hiring as fast, aggressively anyone right now that will want to come and work here during the midst of the worst of the pandemic in the world ongoing in our service territory. And yeah, guess what? I got a letter. Well, the STB takes in complaints from customers and they relay them to me. They will respond, they're just doing a job, we will respond. I found it a little unfortunate that under the circumstances of everything we're doing based upon what our overall service metrics show our performance to be based upon how the STB measures us in terms of how we operate, that we got the letter. But I'm a big boy, I've been around. We'll deal with it, we'll respond, we'll work with the regulator and our customers to try and address the -- any customer issues. The letter is posted. If you can figure out who the customer is that's having a problem from the letter, I don't know why they just don't call me. I tell every customer I meet, I give them my business card, I give them my cellphone number. I say if you've got an issue, give me a call. And Jamie Boychuk 's the same way. So, I wish they just call me if there is a challenge.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for the candid response, Jim.\nOperator: Your next call comes from the line of Jon Chappell. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chappell: Good afternoon. We kept -- theme of the earnings season's been pricing power, and obviously there's things like accessorial that are helping intermodal, but your whole core business has been kind of reset a bit higher on the revenue per carload front. So, the question is, what's the stickiness of some of these pricing increases that have gone in, and where is the total portfolio set on a contractual basis as we think about maybe the ability to push pricing higher this quarter too?\nKevin Boone: Look, gotten a couple of pricing questions already, and I am going to stick to the scripts for the most part, it's a discussion we're having with our customers. We\u2019re being transparent around the cost pressures that we face that we expect to cover those costs. We also want to talk about volume growth with our customers, wallet share, and all those other things. We do have parts of our business that you are well aware of, coal, which moves with the benchmark prices. we have seen some favorability there. We participate when our customers are participating at a good market. And obviously when those markets come down, we participate on the other side as well. Intermodal businesses, some other parts of our business are tied directly to inflation metrics, and those have moved up. And so, we'll see some favorability in those parts of our business that are tied to that end of season. Those will continue to probably flow through into the fourth quarter and in the next year. So, we'll have some momentum there. And then obviously, this is probably our expectations for inflation in the next year or higher than the previous year, last year. And so, we'll have those discussions and price -- price accordingly. I'll probably leave it at that.\nJonathan Chappell: Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, Operator. Afternoon, gentlemen, and congratulations on that impressive OR. I wanted to drill down a little bit on a comment you made about some on-shoring production due to supply chain issues. Is that a one-off customer? Is this a trend you're seeing? And then also, are you having customers coming to you telling you that they might change sort of how they run their inventories in the future?\nKevin Boone: Absolutely. There's -- I can think of multiple industries right now. And you've seen some announcements from some large producers out there that are making incremental investments and U.S. production. I think they're looking at the volatility and how much -- how costly it is to get freight from overseas. Labor is less of a component in some of these production facilities than it's ever been, so that labor differential moving in here to U.S. this doesn't matter as much. It's more about having availability to the inventory and the onshore phenomenon I hope has legs here. We're seeing early signs of that. You've seen some big announcements, I hope we'll see some further announcements coming forward. And we talked about this with the energy renaissance here a number of years ago, when we had cheap energy with gas and oil, and fracking, had that not never materialized, I think this time, in my opinion, could be different. I think all the things are starting to align for our customers and others to reconsider where they want to have production, and more balanced that they don't run into the same issues that they 're having currently.\nJason Seidl: And in terms of total inventories carried, are you seeing a change there as well?\nKevin Boone: I certainly think there's more -- customers are reevaluating forward positioning inventory levels. We're having those discussions around our Transflo products. So, they don't need next-day shipping or things like that, their forward positioning, those things so they can make sure that their production facilities remain up and running. That's very, very important. So, all of these factors are, I think, playing into investments that we'll see customer to make over the next couple of years.\nJason Seidl: Kevin, I appreciate the color. And gentlemen, thanks for the time as always.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Nolan: Hey, thanks, guys. I appreciate you filling me in here. I guess I wanted to -- we talked a lot about labor and some of the issues that are impacting there. But just thinking about maybe the opportunity to actually get a little bit more volume through. And specifically, we talked about coal, but curious what your customers are talking about with respect to further ramp up there. And also, on the intermodal side, we've seen some of the steamships diverting cargoes away from Savannah, for instance, to get into Jacksonville or other places on the east coast trying to fit more -- more volume through the system. But I guess the question is, how capable are you of accommodating some of these things?\nKevin Boone: [Indiscernible] You see in the East Coast ports outgrow the West Coast ports for the net -- last number of years. That's going to continue to ongoing. Savannah is making significant investments. All the ports that we operate into our making investments to be able to handle that. We're well-positioned, whether it's Savannah, Charleston, Jacksonville Tampa, all of those locations are areas where we have the ability to serve. So, we're ready to take on that volume. We made some investments. Our intermodal network, continues to be the best network in the East operationally. There is no question around that. You just look at the service metrics, look at the growth we've been able to handle that better than anybody else. And we'll continue to leverage that product into the market.\nBenjamin Nolan: Sure. So, there's not -- there is no near-term inhabitant to being able to get more volume through some of the network then I guess, is the question.\nJames Foote: We talked about all the capacity. Clearly we have the rail capacity, we're well-positioned with all of the ports, and again, it's not just the international steamship companies that are coming, there's plastics, imports, exports, there's a lot of merchandise business, old business that we move through these ports as well, so yeah, we're working with them through the transload facilities, either our own facilities are partnering with people who are building big, big, big transload facilities on the -- along the coast, to be able to handle the capacity, and we clearly, as I said earlier, have 30% boom on the railroad to handle the traffic without making any more big investments.\nBenjamin Nolan: All right. Thanks a lot, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman. Your line is open.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Hey. Thanks for squeezing me in, and congratulations. Just some questions for Kevin. I'm trying to get used to my model with quality carriers out here. Your non-locomotive fuel expense was up about 38 million year-on-year. How much of that was attributable to the inclusion of quality?\nSean Pelkey: Just a little over 20 million.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Okay. And just one other net, the depreciation that was up about 19 million sequentially. About how much of that would've been attributable to quality?\nSean Pelkey: Jeff, it's Sean again. Yeah, about half of that is related to quality. We'll see that impact carry forward.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Okay. That's all I have. Congratulations. Terrific quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time, and this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Foote",
            "content": "Right. Thanks, Bill. And thank you to all who are joining us today for the call. I want to begin by thanking all of CSX 's employees for their extraordinary efforts to help our customers navigate the strained global supply chain. Across virtually every industry, there are challenges presented by extended lead times, port congestion, shortages of labor and key materials, and lack of storage capacity. While the current operating environment is challenging, we are not sitting idle. We are designing new solutions to help reduce congestion, adding container yards and drayage to keep intermodal terminals fluid. And we're investing in both people and network capacity to ensure CSX is able to reliably meet customer needs today and for years to come. In a few minutes, Kevin will go through the revenue numbers and discuss some of the steps we are taking to provide new service offerings to our customers, to help them overcome these challenges. And Jamie will provide an update of our hiring initiatives, as well as actions we are taking to keep our network fluid. So, let's first turn to the presentation and begin on slide 4 with an overview of our third quarter results. Operating income increased 26% to $1.44 billion. Earnings per share increased 34% to $0.43. And the operating ratio improved by 50 basis points to 56.4. These figures include the results of quality carriers which did not have a significant income -- impact on operating income. But increased third quarter operating ratio by approximately 250 basis points, excluding transaction and integration expenses. I'll now take it over to Kevin. Great. Thank you, Sean. Concluding with Slide 12, we are maintaining a full-year outlook for double-digit revenue growth before the impact from quality carriers. We expect capital expenditures to be at the top end of our initial $1.7 to $1.8 billion range due to materials cost inflation, the capacity investments we just reviewed, and the inclusion of quality carrier's capital spending. I will conclude my remarks the same way I began. We are committed to helping our customers overcome the current supply chain challenges. And as you heard today, our entire team is aligned around this goal. And we will continue to act. We have a strong hiring pipeline, and we will hire until we have staffed the network to match demand. We expect to higher above attrition throughout the rest of this year and into next year. Economic demand remains strong and CSX will help customers capture that demand. Everything we do begins with a commitment to providing customers a high-quality service. We will build on the positive momentum from actions taken to date. We will continue putting resources in place to drive growth, and we will provide customers with creative new offerings that makes CSX a more meaningful part of the customer supply chain. Thank you, Bill. Hey, Tom, it's Jim. Let me take a shot. I would say yeah, we're clearly constrained. There was more business out there this quarter, there has been more business out there throughout this year that we could not handle. The primary reason for that is our inability, like everyone else in the world right now, to ramp up our workforce coming out of the steep declines of the early phases of the pandemic. And as Jamie talked about, we're now starting to see the fruits of all of our hard work for the last 9 months or more, and are beginning to bring on more people and actually deploy those people into the field so we're able to operate a little bit better. And we fully expect that that trend will continue as we go forward, unless some other crazy curve ball gets thrown at us. And being a much, much better position as we exit this year and move into next year, and hopefully be able to take advantage of what seems to be a continuation of strong demand for transportation services into 2022, I know some people are even saying 2023. My first -- the number 1 priority is getting enough CSX employees in the training -- principally conductors on the train so we can operate more fluidly and get back to some of the performance metrics that we were putting up pre -pandemic in the end of 2019 and beginning of 2020. The fluidity, the dwell, the on-time performance, the customer service metrics that we put out there, the trip plan compliance numbers, those numbers are all down, and that's principally a result of our having an extremely difficult time getting people to come to work for us. It's taken a complete I would say reengineering of the hiring process, a complete review of everything that we do when we onboard employees for us to get to this point. This is -- this has been extremely difficult we're no different than every -- every business at least in the U.S, every business I think. Every business, every hospital, every school, everybody is struggling with the same phenomenon of trying to get people to come to work. I am confident that we have done everything we can do right now and are seeing that numbers are increasing. In terms of the number of employees that we can put into our training programs and begin to qualify them to go to work. Like I said, unless something else comes along that disrupts that process, I hope we're going to be in a lot better shape at the end of this year, the beginning of next year than we have been over the last 9 months. Thank you. I think Kevin did a very good job of outlining all of the activities that we've been undertaking here over the last 6 months or so to do on our own without any prodding to improve and increase capacity. We were way ahead of the curve. The -- Chicago, the biggest terminal for us in terms of intermodal capacity, expanding our 59th Street facility, we bought that property two years ago.

I had thought, I believe it was on a year-end conference call in January, where I called out the fact that we were going to be hiring. I fully believed, in as much as at that point in time we had about 300 of our trainees and service employees off one COVID, that we would just simply do what we've always done; we'd hire 500 employees. The 300 employees would come back from off sick, and we'd be rocking and rolling and we've been moving freight. No one -- no one ever gave me a heads up that says, by the way when you want to hire somebody, nobody is going to want to work for you. Plus, all the people that you head furloughed as the railroad had this trafficked decline so dramatically. So many more than was usual when we call them back and said you want to come back to work they said no, I've decided to go do something else. I've changed my lifestyle. I'm going to go enjoy the scenery on the Jersey course -- coast or whatever it might be. This is not a phenomenon that is unique to CSX. This is a phenomenon that nobody saw coming, and it is a phenomenon that everybody in the supply chain, whether you're a trucker, whether your steamship Company, whether you're a port, whether you're a warehouse operator, whatever you do, this is a phenomenon that is impacting everyone and everyone is trying to deal with this -- what is now the new norm. So, we've had to change everything the way we think about it, and that's -- but have done that. As we always do, we adapted, we recognized this -- the situation, we adapted and we made changes, and that's why we're reasonably confident that we'll be in better shape as we move forward this year and in pretty good shape as we move in to next year. I don't need the -- I don't need any help from the government in order to figure out what I'm supposed to do, I just don't want to make sure the government does something that screws it up worse. I think we're -- what we're doing is we're responding the situation, that's simple as that. We can think, we can plan, we can do all kinds of things. Unfortunately, I think we've had more black swan events in the last 2 years than most people would experience in a lifetime. So, as I said, what's the next thing? I am -- I started off my remarks telling -- saying how proud I was of our employees. All of this going on, all of these challenges, all of these changes, all of these demands, all of these people saying first of all Jesus, you know, the entire supply chain issue was as a result of the railroads. Oh my God, the railroads screwed this thing up. Then as time went on, everybody figured out it's not really the railroads. We don't own the warehouses where this stuff goes, we don't have the trucks to bring it there. If I need to buy a truck and bring it there, I'll bring it there and I'll put the box in the warehouse parking lot, going to be somebody else's problem. But most of the issues associated with everything that is talked about, the railroads are doing an extremely good job. Their employees have been critical of workers throughout the entire pandemic have been out there working, and not been home in the basement, have been complying with all the requirements and making sure that the economy keeps growing. And so, the railroad guys, not just CSX, but could be entire railroad industry's been an up phenomenal job under unbelievably difficult circumstances. Yup, you did the math, and yeah, that was excluding some of the transaction costs and some other things too. So, it's pretty simple math. Yeah, the railroad is running efficiently. When we stretch, as we've always said this a million, million times. This is not about all OR, this is not about how low can we go, how many heads can we take out. When we run the railroad good, when we stretch, like we're doing right now, and the reason we're stretching is because we're trying every single hour of every single day to move our customers' freight. And when you do that, and you've focused on getting it there as quickly as you can and efficiently as you can. It results in unfortunately not a perfect service product, but a very good service product in difficult times. You do it efficiently. And as a result of that, the score adds up that's says you got a low operating ratio, but that's not the goal that's just a result. And so yes, we run up a pretty good number. I would've preferred to do a lot more business as we said, we could have. And we try to do every single day, we try to move more freight. Kevin is out there right now, constantly trying to figure out how you can provide solutions to our customers. Our goal here is to move more freight. That's what we do. We move freight, and the more freight we move, the more revenue you pour in the top, the more efficiently you operate is simple is that, it's just math. So, think about what they -- think about, you want to worry about what the operating ratio was? Think about what the operating ratio could be for the railroad industry if they were able to grow more than it's historically grown. Then you can start talking about what the operating ratios might be, stop thinking about how much cost you can take out. Yeah well, I'm trying to unscramble it for myself, and I've said from the very beginning of this year, that we had a challenge in terms of hiring. We needed to hire, I thought we would be able to hire like we always had. We aren't able to hire like we always did, and we've said that now for 3 quarters. You have my metrics as reported to the STB in terms of all of the railroads, whether it'd be velocity, whether it'd be dwell, my service metrics are continuing to lead in most areas. So, the railroad here is still running better than most. During that period of time, where we were finding out that a lot of people wanted to make career choices and leave the Company that we hadn't expected, we were having the difficulties that everybody else was having during that period of time. We were the epicenter of the world in terms of the pandemic here in Jacksonville. So, I think we got probably hit during that period of time a little more severely the states of Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Tennessee, Mississippi have had a little rougher time, and I'm not calling out any reasons why that might be, that's just the facts. And so, while we have been saying publicly, we are hiring as fast, aggressively anyone right now that will want to come and work here during the midst of the worst of the pandemic in the world ongoing in our service territory. And yeah, guess what? I got a letter. Well, the STB takes in complaints from customers and they relay them to me. They will respond, they're just doing a job, we will respond. I found it a little unfortunate that under the circumstances of everything we're doing based upon what our overall service metrics show our performance to be based upon how the STB measures us in terms of how we operate, that we got the letter. But I'm a big boy, I've been around. We'll deal with it, we'll respond, we'll work with the regulator and our customers to try and address the -- any customer issues. The letter is posted. If you can figure out who the customer is that's having a problem from the letter, I don't know why they just don't call me. I tell every customer I meet, I give them my business card, I give them my cellphone number. I say if you've got an issue, give me a call. And Jamie Boychuk 's the same way. So, I wish they just call me if there is a challenge. We talked about all the capacity. Clearly we have the rail capacity, we're well-positioned with all of the ports, and again, it's not just the international steamship companies that are coming, there's plastics, imports, exports, there's a lot of merchandise business, old business that we move through these ports as well, so yeah, we're working with them through the transload facilities, either our own facilities are partnering with people who are building big, big, big transload facilities on the -- along the coast, to be able to handle the capacity, and we clearly, as I said earlier, have 30% boom on the railroad to handle the traffic without making any more big investments."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5, third-quarter revenue increased 24% year-over-year, with growth across all major lines of business. Inclusion of quality carriers, revenue represented roughly 8% points of the total increase. Supply chain challenges, including a lack of labor and equipment continued to impact almost every market we serve, driving volatility and freight flows and uneven volumes. Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volumes as higher revenue across all other markets was offset by declines in auto, driven by the ongoing semiconductor shortages. The industrial and construction related markets, such as metals and equipment or its products and minerals, all showed strong year-over-year volume growth. In addition, our core chemicals business grow, but was partially offset by declines in crude oil and other energy-related markets. Inter-modal revenue increased 14% on 4% higher volumes. Due to increased international shipments as a result of strong demand. Inventory replenishment, and growth in rail volumes from east coast ports. The domestic side was more challenged as multiple supply-side constraints, including container and chassis shortages, have resulted in the inability to meet the strong demand. Coal revenue increased 39% on 16% higher volumes, with growth across all end markets. Domestic coal benefited from higher utility and industrial demand, and export coal revenue increased from the combination of higher demand and higher export benchmark prices. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage due to the broader supply chain disruptions from truck driver shortages, chassis availability, and the lack of warehouse capacity. Turning to Slide 6. This is an extraordinary time as customers and global supply chain face challenges we have never experienced before. On trucks to chassis, supports to containers, lack of truck drivers, to labor challenges at the warehouse, and production facilities. We are seeing shortages everywhere. The entire CSX team has been highly focused on delivering new, innovative solutions and partnering with customers to address the supply chain challenges by driving more volume to the railroad. Across the network we have accelerated investments to create new capacity. To address the truck driver shortages, we have added 13 new overflow container yards, implemented new steel wheel options for West Coast cargo. And added Transflo sites that offer customers additional options to move their freight at a lower cost. To address the port congestion and container shortages we have added new solutions to accelerate repositioning of containers. We utilized port deport lanes to alleviate marine terminal congestion. We are working closely with partners, including GPA to utilize additional and Lynn rail yards to help reduce congestion at the port. We have also been aggressively expanding our customer solutions team to further supplement the significant investments we are making in customer facing technology. Our team is working diligently to create new solutions and options for shippers with supply chain disruptions unlikely to improve in the near term. Finally, we are starting to see early signs of customers making long-term investment decisions to reinvest in onshore production and supply chain solutions. To address these customer needs, we continue to develop and invest in new CSX select sites that offer shovel-ready CSX served solution to meet customer requirements. With that, I will hand it over to Jamie to discuss operations. Maybe I'll let Sean take the OR question, but I don't think we're giving guidance today on next year. But on the quality carriers, as you'll remember that, that really is focused on our chemical franchise and the customer reception has been overwhelmingly positive in a market where supply is constrained. Our customers were looking for more options to move their freight, and so Randy and his team combined with our Transflo team have found a number of options and we're moving freight today. Now that we're doing it in a way where it's thoughtful and calculated, and that the customer's seeing a good service on that product, and we'll continue to build momentum in the market. But I think everything that we thought before we made the acquisition is coming true. The only thing I will say is from a conquipment standpoint, obviously with things tight right now, the equipment backlog is going to take a little bit long in the next year to really ramp that up. When we think about some of the ISO tank solutions that we're contemplating out there. So other than that, everything is full speed ahead. I would say there's customers that we believe would be longer -- would take a lot longer to adopt, that have been first to adopt, which is exciting for us markets leaders in the industry, and their adoption I think is going to really set the tone for this to really take off into the market. The other thing that I think is positive is shows other partners that we have that we're capable of doing this using the Transflo solution in unique ways. And we don't always have to do it ourselves. We would love partners to continue to bring freight and through our all of our different capabilities that we have so I think that momentum is starting to be seen in the market as well. Brandon, I guess the question was, what can we do with more headcount? The team is going to -- Strategically, we're going to move a lot more freight. When we talk to customers right now, they 're are looking for capacity, and they're trying to offset a lot of cost inflation too. The environment couldn't be any better for us to go out and sell the product we have. So, we're going to move more freight and we're going to get more wallet share with the customer. It's a perfect environment for us. Look, gotten a couple of pricing questions already, and I am going to stick to the scripts for the most part, it's a discussion we're having with our customers. We're being transparent around the cost pressures that we face that we expect to cover those costs. We also want to talk about volume growth with our customers, wallet share, and all those other things. We do have parts of our business that you are well aware of, coal, which moves with the benchmark prices. we have seen some favorability there. We participate when our customers are participating at a good market. And obviously when those markets come down, we participate on the other side as well. Intermodal businesses, some other parts of our business are tied directly to inflation metrics, and those have moved up. And so, we'll see some favorability in those parts of our business that are tied to that end of season. Those will continue to probably flow through into the fourth quarter and in the next year. So, we'll have some momentum there. And then obviously, this is probably our expectations for inflation in the next year or higher than the previous year, last year. And so, we'll have those discussions and price -- price accordingly. I'll probably leave it at that. Absolutely. There's -- I can think of multiple industries right now. And you've seen some announcements from some large producers out there that are making incremental investments and U.S. production. I think they're looking at the volatility and how much -- how costly it is to get freight from overseas. Labor is less of a component in some of these production facilities than it's ever been, so that labor differential moving in here to U.S. this doesn't matter as much. It's more about having availability to the inventory and the onshore phenomenon I hope has legs here. We're seeing early signs of that. You've seen some big announcements, I hope we'll see some further announcements coming forward. And we talked about this with the energy renaissance here a number of years ago, when we had cheap energy with gas and oil, and fracking, had that not never materialized, I think this time, in my opinion, could be different. I think all the things are starting to align for our customers and others to reconsider where they want to have production, and more balanced that they don't run into the same issues that they 're having currently. I certainly think there's more -- customers are reevaluating forward positioning inventory levels. We're having those discussions around our Transflo products. So, they don't need next-day shipping or things like that, their forward positioning, those things so they can make sure that their production facilities remain up and running. That's very, very important. So, all of these factors are, I think, playing into investments that we'll see customer to make over the next couple of years. [Indiscernible] You see in the East Coast ports outgrow the West Coast ports for the net -- last number of years. That's going to continue to ongoing. Savannah is making significant investments. All the ports that we operate into our making investments to be able to handle that. We're well-positioned, whether it's Savannah, Charleston, Jacksonville Tampa, all of those locations are areas where we have the ability to serve. So, we're ready to take on that volume. We made some investments. Our intermodal network, continues to be the best network in the East operationally. There is no question around that. You just look at the service metrics, look at the growth we've been able to handle that better than anybody else. And we'll continue to leverage that product into the market."

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. And good afternoon. Looking at the income statement on Slide 9, operating income grew nearly $300 million or 26%. Revenue was up 24%, reflecting gains across all major markets, higher fuel prices, and the impact of quality carriers. The operating ratio of 56.4% is a third quarter record for CSX. As we focus on operating efficiently and growing the business. As a reminder, this includes an impact of approximately 250 basis points from the ongoing operations of quality. Looking below the line, interest and other expense was 16 million favorable to last year due to a lower weighted average coupon, and lower average debt balances, as well as favorable pension impacts. An income tax expense was up on higher pre -tax earnings. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%. Looking at expenses in more detail on the next slide, Total cost increased $349 million or 23% in the quarter. Including transaction-related expenses, approximately 200 million of the increase was driven by quality carriers. Higher locomotive fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about 90 million versus last year. Partially offsetting these items, real estate gains were 56 million higher. Non-fuel inflation remains steady versus last quarter at around 3%. As I mentioned last time, we have some lagging contracts that may drive higher inflation going into next year. As Jamie discussed, we continue to focus on hiring and retaining train and engine employees. While head count was roughly flat sequentially, excluding the addition of quality carriers. The conductor count was up and was offset by reductions in other areas of the business. As a result, we experienced $16 million more in hiring and retention costs versus last year. You'll note that we have renamed the prior MS&O line to purchase services and other. The base expenses are identical to the prior MS&O category. But the new description better reflects the costs in this line post-acquisition. Increased costs on this line reflected the addition of quality, as well as higher intermodal terminal and locomotive expense. Depreciation was up on a higher asset base that also includes the acquisition impact. Finally, we're proud to report another all-time record for fuel efficiency in the quarter. This reflects continued focus and investment by CSX, demonstrating our commitment to sustainability and the ongoing environmental advantage of rail. Looking into the fourth quarter, we typically see a seasonal increase in operating expense due to weather, lower capitalized labor, as well as holidays and vacations, that trend should continue this year. In addition to expected headwinds from higher incentive compensation and lower sequential gains on property sales in the fourth quarter. Peak-season expenses are also likely to be higher than normal as a result of ongoing supply chain disruptions. Now, turning to cash flow on Slide 11. With operating income up 34% on a year-to-date basis. Free cash flow before dividends this year is $2.9 billion up nearly 50%. Free cash flow conversion on net income is exceeding 100% year-to-date. And we expect it to remain near this level on a full-year basis. The Company's cash balance of 2.2 billion is beginning to normalize. The lower balance reflects the acquisition in the quarter and a step-up in distributions to shareholders. We expect cash to continue to normalize over time. After fully funding capital investments in our core infrastructure, year-to-date shareholder returns have exceeded 2.9 billion, including approximately $2.3 billion in buybacks and over $600 million in dividends. We will continue to be balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach, and we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim, for his closing remarks. Thank you. And I'll take a shot at this, Kevin. I think it's clear that cost inflation over the last year, expectations have risen and our arising in the next year. And this is not surprising to our customers are facing the same cost inflation pressures that we see. and what we strive to do is be transparent around that in our conversations with customers. Fourth quarter and first quarter are heavy renewal periods for us, so we'll be having those discussions. But the exciting part though, as we get into a higher inflation environment, is really the value proposition we offer. When a customer is looking to offset some of that cost inflation, rail is just a great alternative. They shift more of their volumes over to rail. And then you add on top of that the persistent driver shortages that we're likely to see well into next year and probably the years ahead, the value proposition is there. Then on top of that, the environmental discussions that we're having increasingly with customers is really resonating with those. It's no surprise. Cost inflation is higher than what we saw last year. It will be a higher-cost inflation environment than what we probably seen in the last number of years. And we've got to have conversations with our customers around that. Well we get to touch, as I mentioned, contracts into the fourth and first 2 quarter, that's a heavy renewal period and we will continue to have those discussions. I think I will probably leave it at that. Yeah, on the -- clearly on the export coal side, you've seen some favorability on the prices there. And as we've mentioned before, our prices tied to the benchmarks and you will see some favorability sequentially in the fourth quarter versus third quarter. It's a strong market. We continue to see favorability in the next year, how long it holds up at these levels that probably weren't held here. But these are extremely elevated levels that will probably carry into next year and hopefully create some favorability there. But it's a -- everybody is trying to produce more coal and we're trying to move more of it today. And at the mine, there's been some struggles here in the third quarter as you could see with some of the production hiccups that some of the producers have had. We're working through that as diligently as we can and really ramping up our ability to serve those customers. Yeah. Thanks, Justin. You got the items right; higher incentive comp, lower gains on property sales, and then just some additional costs related to the supply chain. If you put all those together, you're probably looking at about a couple of pennies over and above what we would normally see from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. If you look just at the pure other revenue line, not considering the tracking revenue line which should -- tracking revenue should be pretty consistent quarter-to-quarter, really the big driver, as Kevin said there, is the intermodal storage and premise use charges as well as demurrage. And that's a direct result of what's going on in the supply chain that we've been talking about here. So as things start to improve, that line -- the other revenue line will come down. But here we sit in October, we're probably in about the same place as we are -- we were in Q3. And we'll see where it goes from here. Yes, Scott. So, what we're looking on a sequential basis is modest increases in headcount, right? We're bringing on -- trying to fill classes of 40 every week and then getting those folks trained up and out into the field. So, you're not going to see dramatic increases in headcount. I think it's also fair to assume that we've got capacity still on our existing trains and capacity on the network, so we are hiring for growth, but it's not -- it doesn't need to be one for one. I don't see any reason why that wouldn't be the target. Yeah. Just on the OR question, we -- we're not going to give OR guidance, but I think it's fair to assume sequentially, given some of the cost pressures as well as just the normal seasonality, we'll probably see an OR that's a little bit higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter. Just a little over 20 million. Jeff, it's Sean again. Yeah, about half of that is related to quality. We'll see that impact carry forward."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin. As noted, our teams are working closely together to find new ways to overcome the supply chain disruptions, and provide new solutions for our customers. In addition to the ongoing supply challenges, this past quarter was further impacted by a rising COVID mark cost due to the Delta variant. At peak, we had several hundred employees marked off, including regional concentrations that required us to adjust our network plan in real-time to get customers their freight. Despite these challenges, we are able to maintain network performance compared to the prior quarter. And we expect the initiatives we have underway to drive them... fluid going forward, Kevin touched on many of the things we're doing to help reduce congestion at the ports and keep containers moving. And I want to thank my inter modal team for the exceptional work they're doing to accomplish these goals. These efforts are highlighted by the nearly 90% inter modal trip line compliance. They continue to deliver in a challenging environment. We entered the year focused on hiring. The people required to respond to the rising demand. And I'm proud of how our team has been able to think creatively and act decisively to overcome the challenges presented by the tight labor market. Over the course of the year we have redesigned our recruiting process to eliminate unnecessary steps and significantly shorten the time from application to offer. We have also implemented new recruiting tools and referral programs that are improving our application through different conversation rates and better at identifying highly qualified candidates. These efforts have successfully increased the size and frequency of our conductor classes and provided strong ongoing higher visibility by expanding our new higher pipeline, almost 300% since July. We are also increasing intermodal headcount and supplemental labor to keep the terminals fluid and allow us to continue moving containers for our customers. While these hiring initiatives are underway, we're taking steps to increase the availability of our existing T&E workforce. We have implemented new attendance base initiative programs, which allows us to better utilize our existing headcount to move more freight for our customers. We're also making upgrades to our network to increase throughput and create additional capacity. We are installing more automated equipment at our hump yards. We're converting intermodal terminals to grounded facilities in order to increase capacity. And we are expanding our investment in autonomous cranes to increase intermodal terminal throughput. While we still have sufficient line of road capacity, we are strategically investing in growth by extending sidings in select locations across the network. These siding investments will allow us to continue to refine our train plan, and provide growth capacity for years to come. Every action we take is focused on network reliability that begins and ends with running a balanced train plan to minimize delay, and maximize network performance. Running a scheduled network ensures assets are in the right place at the right time. We will continue to maintain network balance and the principles of scheduled railroading as we add resources to meet current demand. These principles have allowed us to keep the intermodal network open and running well this year, and we are focused on continuing the strong performance as we enter into peak season. Turning to Slide 8. Maintaining a safe operation is the foundation to the success of any other operating goal we want to pursue, and we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the third quarter, personal injury rate improved sequentially, and ongoing safety initiatives also drove a decrease in injury severity. While train accident rate increased slightly from last quarter's record results, accidents rates have improved year-over-year. Focus for the remainder of the year will be critical rule compliance, and reducing human factor accidents. We are leveraging the approximate 9,000 tablets distributed to Field employees to more productively deliver these messages. Not only did the tablets allow real-time communication on key safety information, but we're also able to more effectively combine electronic and in-person communications to increase the impact of our training programs and drive lasting changes, and the behavior that will better protect our employees. I will now turn the call over to Sean for the financials."

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBill Slater: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Acting Chief Financial Officer. On Slide 2 is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\nJames Foote: Great, thanks Bill, and thank you for joining us on the call today. This quarter's results highlight just how quickly volumes have rebounded as each of our three lines of business experienced record growth as we lapped the most severe economic impacts of the pandemic. I want to first thank all of the CSX's railroaders for their unwavering commitment to our customers as they worked very hard to deliver service in a very difficult operating environment. As we enter the second half of the year, our focus is squarely on continuing this growth. We have kept our yards and terminals open and freight moving throughout the recovery and we will continue taking the necessary steps to add resources and increase fluidity in order to help customers meet their own growth targets this year despite the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Let's begin with Slide 5 in the presentation and an overview of our second quarter financial results. Operating income increased to $1.69 billion and earnings per share rose to $0.52. These figures include $349 million and $0.12 per share impact from the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our operating ratio was 43.4 including an 11.7 percentage point impact from the Virginia transaction. Excluding these impacts, operating income increased 62%, earnings per share increased 82%, and the operating ratio improved 820 basis points. Turning to Slide 6, revenue increased 33% on 27% volume growth. Merchandise revenue increased 26% on 21% higher volumes led by automotive, metals and equipment and Ag improved markets. Intermodal revenue increased 42% on 28% volume growth setting a new record for average daily volume. Both domestic and international volumes increased significantly and continued to benefit from strong demand for transportation services as well as growth from East Coast ports. Coal revenue increased 47% on 44% higher volumes with growth across all core markets. Domestic coal benefited from higher utility and industrial demand in both export net and thermal coal volumes rebounded meaningfully. Other revenue growth was driven by increased intermodal storage and equipment usage as well as higher revenue from affiliates. Turning to Slide 7, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the second quarter we achieved a new record low number of train accidents driven by our focus on increased communication and education to reduce human factor caused accidents. Safety initiatives for the remainder of the year will focus on culture, communication, and continuous education. As an example, we've recently introduced a modified approach to operational testing for T&E employees. The new program is designed to be instructive rather than disciplinary to increase employee engagement and create lasting changes in behavior. Combined with face to face safety summits and expanded education of top causes of incidents, these new programs will further reduce risk and protect our workforce. Moving to Slide 8, let's review this quarter's operating metrics. The intermodal segment continues to perform well. Intermodal trip plan performance averaged 89% for the quarter and through this of our reservation system and the hard work of our intermodal team, we have kept all our intermodal terminals open over the last year as volumes surged. Carload trip plan performance improved sequentially to 69% for the quarter and we are focused on continuing this positive momentum throughout the rest of the year. We are also working to further improve network fluidity. Car dwell improved sequentially and remains the lowest in the industry. Velocity began to turn positively exiting the quarter and we expect to see further improvements in both metrics in the second half of the year. On Slide 9, I want to take the opportunity to highlight some of the actions we are taking to resource the network for growth. As I mentioned on previous calls, we entered the year planning to add community headcount in response to the expected growth and we'll continue adding through the second half of the year. Over the past several months we have increased the size and number of our new conductor classes and then also enacted new programs to improve availability of existing employees to ensure that we have resources in place to capture the rising demand and serve our customers well. We staged locomotives across the network as we prepared for the incremental volumes. While these assets provide additional flexibility to react to customer demand, we are maintaining a balanced operating plan and we are investing in the safety and reliability of our network. We demonstrated this commitment by maintaining our capital spend throughout the pandemic and we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term growth and sustainability of our business. We still have ample capacity across the network for growth and we are working to find new ways to improve the efficiency and impact of our capital spending programs. Turning to Slide 10, our focus on investing for the future extends through improving the safety, productivity and sustainability of CSX's operations through the increased use of technology, while we are driving further emissions reductions through our advancement of energy management software and the expanded use of fuel saving technologies. In addition to the almost 40% increase in distributed powertrains year-over-year, we continue to expand the number of distributed power equipped locomotives. We are adding that capability to approximately 100 locomotives this year in addition to including that in all the locomotive rebuilds we are performing. We are also expanding use of inspection technologies to improve the safety of our operations and then increase the efficacy of our track maintenance and repair programs. We are performing roughly 80% of our drone inspection flights this year and our increased use of autonomous track inspections cars with improving safety by better highlighting areas in need of repair. Lastly, we are providing our field employees with digital tools to replace inefficient manual or paper based processes to increase the speed of communication across the railroad. We have distributed roughly 9000 tablets to employees which are improving both safety and productivity by allowing real time information sharing and feedback. We are pleased with the success of these programs to date and we are only beginning to see the potential value these investments can bring. With more efficient network planning and dispatching we are changing our customers interactive CSX. We see significant opportunities to leverage technology to improve the pace and quality of decision making across our business. I'll now turn it over to Sean to run through the numbers.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Jim. I'm pleased to be here today and I'm excited for the opportunity to continue serving this company at an important time in our history as we focus on culture, innovation and growth. Looking at the second quarter financial results on Slide 12, revenue increased $735 million or 33% versus the prior year. This reflects growth across every market as we cycle the impacts of COVID-19. Revenue per unit growth of 5% includes a 2% impact from higher fuel surcharge revenue, combined with favorable pricing and higher other revenue. Total expenses were 9% lower in the quarter. These results included a $349 million gain related to the sale of property rights to Virginia which was partially offset by the impact of higher fuel price. Excluding the property gain and the impact of fuel price, expenses would have been up 9% on a volume increase of 27%. Before I get into specifics by line, I would like to address the topic of inflation. The good news is, we have secured adequate inventory and supply commitments for critical materials and we've worked to lock in the vast majority of unit costs for 2021. Excluding locomotive fuel, expense inflation this quarter was just above 3% and we don't expect that to move much going into the second half. We are seeing cost pressures on capital materials for core infrastructure and are working to offset that through increased productivity, sourcing shifts and inventory management. We don\u2019t expect any change to the overall capital budget this year. Several of our supplier contracts are based on lagging indicators, so we will continue to monitor things closely going into next year and ensure inventory levels for critical materials remain adequate. Now, moving down to the specific expense line items for Q2, labor and fringe was up 18%. Higher volume and inflation together drove a $75 million increase in expense. Additionally, incentive compensation increased $60 million on higher projections for award payouts this year coupled with prior year downward adjustments related to COVID impacts. We continue to absorb growth on the network and sustain productivity gains. As we work to hire conductors, we've increased the use of distributed power and continue to optimize the plan. While total headcount is roughly flat from year-end 2020, the active T&E count is up approximately 200 this year, and we expect continued sequential increases in the third and fourth quarters. MS&O expense increased 6% or $23 million in the second quarter as higher volumes and inflation were the primary drivers. Locomotive productivity measured in GTMs per available horsepower hour improved 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. We expect this to improve even further going forward as velocity and cycle times recover. In addition, we are absorbing growth and driving efficiencies at our intermodal terminals with cost per container lift down 12% year-over-year. Fuel expense increased $103 million driven by average fuel prices that nearly doubled as well as higher volume. During the quarter we also recorded an $18 million benefit related to the settlement of the state fuel tax matter. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $4 million in the quarter primarily due to a larger asset base. Equipment rent expense increased $9 million or 12%. The impact of higher volume on freight car rents was partially offset by higher net earnings at affiliates. As a result of the Virginia transaction, gains on property dispositions increased significantly in the second quarter. As a reminder, the gain during the quarter was related to the first phase of the transaction. Total proceeds are expected to be $525 million including $200 million already received, $200 million later this year, and the remaining $125 million expected next year. Turning below the line, interest expense improved $10 million, due to a lower weighted average coupon and lower average debt balances. Other income increased $5 million as favorable pension impacts were partially offset by lower interest on cash held. Income tax expense increased $204 million, mostly due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 23.3% and was impacted by a state legislative change this quarter. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.7 billion. The reported operating ratio was 43.4%, including a benefit of approximately 1200 basis points from property gains. Now these results do not include any impact from the Quality Carriers acquisition, which closed on July 1. The acquisition will add approximately 6% to CSX's revenue, and is expected to be relatively neutral to operating income and EPS this year due to the impact of transaction and integration related expenses. Quality tracking revenue will be recorded in the other revenue line. On the cost side, about two thirds of the expense will be MS&O. About one quarter of it is split between labor and fuel with the rest hitting depreciation and rents. Going forward we expect to leverage the Quality transaction to accelerate rail growth by offering new multimodal products, extending our reach and further integrating CSX into our customers supply chains. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 13. As you know, free cash flow is a major focus for this team. Through the second quarter free cash flow before dividends was $1.9 billion up 35% versus the prior year. Just to put that in context, that's $300 million more free cash flow than we generated in all of 2017. Year-to-date free cash flow conversion on net income is 100%, and we expect it to remain near that level on a full year basis. The company's cash balance remains elevated at nearly $3 billion. Our expectation remains that this will normalize over time as we continue to invest in the business, and return capital to shareholders. Year-to-date shareholder returns are nearly $1.7 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in buybacks and $400 million in dividends. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders with a balanced and opportunistic approach to buybacks. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJames Foote: Great, thanks, Sean. Concluding with Slide 15, we are maintaining a full year revenue outlook. Excluding the impact from Quality Carriers, we continue to project double-digit revenue growth for the year. As Sean mentioned, the acquisition will add approximately 6% incremental revenue growth on an annualized basis, and we expect the impact this year to be about half of that. We will achieve these growth targets by providing our customers with a high quality service product. As I said, we are taking necessary steps to ensure we deliver on this commitment. Our capital expenditure outlook remains at $1.7 to $1.8 billion for the year and we will continue returning cash to shareholders. Demand remains strong and so does our commitment to customers. We are resourcing the network for growth. We are driving operational improvements to add capacity through increased asset utilization. We are investing in our business for the long-term and we continue to design new and creative solutions through our customers to move more freight with CSX today, and for years to come. Now back to Bill for the Q&A.\nBill Slater: Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nAllison Landry: Good afternoon and thanks. I was hoping you could maybe talk about the underlying pricing environment specifically what you're seeing on contract renewals even if just directionally from Q1? And then just, given the myriad of inflationary pressures and very tight truck capacity, do you think there is scope for a more rapid acceleration in core price when you see the cost cycle? Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Hey Allison, this is Kevin. In terms of price inflation today, and cost inflation what we are seeing and I'm keeping close with Sean and staying close to that so we can be transparent with our customers and explain to them what we're seeing in the market, none of that is a surprise to them. They're seeing it in their business. They certainly understand the pressures that are out there in terms of labor and other material costs. What we're really trying to do is see if some of these things are transitory or whether they're really here for the long term and we'll continue to evaluate that throughout the year. When you look at generally our contracts we have a lot of those renewals that occur in the fourth and first quarter. They're concentrated in those quarters and really it represents about 70% of our annual contract renewal activity, so we'll continue to look at that. We're communicating transparent with our customers and expect to obviously achieve that cost inflation through our pricing.\nAllison Landry: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thank you, operator. Hi everyone and congrats on the on the great performance. Sean, if I look at the underlying operating ratio in the second quarter of 55.1%, is there any reason that that moderates in the back half? I guess you have to add that, we have to add the Quality Carriers into the mix, that looks like it's maybe 100 bps of negative impact this year given it's half of the $600 million or so in revenue. But I would just, if you just take that and table it for a second, mix is getting better hopefully in the back half. Kevin just talked about 70% repricing towards the end of this year and maybe half of that towards the end of this year. I would just expect that the underlying OR [ph] ex-the Quality Carriers acquisition gets better in the second half versus the stellar performance in the second quarter, if you can just help us think about that? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Yes, thanks Amit. So, when you think about the second quarter, not a whole lot of unique items in there other than Virginia transaction, and then I talked about the impact of the fuel tax settlement there. So strip those out and carry it forward to the second half of the year, what's going to impact the operating ratio in the second half of the year Quality, you're right, I think you're doing the math correctly there. We've got some hiring to do, so we're going to be bringing on some crews. If we bring on the crews and network fluidity improves and we're able to move the volume that will be a positive, but there'll be a cost to bringing those crews on. We'll also going to have some incentives here to increase the availability of crews. So that will be an impact. And then, probably the biggest variable is what does volume look like in the second half. We've been able to demonstrate here, albeit on a relatively easy comp that the drop through is pretty good, but the margins in the second half will be highly dependent on what the volume looks like.\nAmit Mehrotra: Right, but then on the labor side, I think they're 6% to 7% of the workforce that it fits every year. So, when you're talking about growth in sequential labor or headcount, is that a net number or gross number net of attrition if you can just provide a little bit color on that as well?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, so I mean, we're going to continue hiring through the rest of the year and as long as we need to in order to move the volume and increase fluidity. I would expect sequential headcount is probably going to go up a little bit on a net basis, both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter.\nAmit Mehrotra: Okay, makes sense. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is now open.\nChristian Wetherbee: Yes, hey thanks. Good afternoon everybody. Just may be a question on the revenue outlook for the back half of the year. It sounds you are maintaining your outlook and I think, I guess when we think about volumes, do you feel like the network is at all constrained in order to take on incremental volume? I mean, do you think you're running kind of below what the demand environment would be able to sort of provide you? And then in that context, how do you feel about sort of service, are there some improvements that need to be made whether those heads coming back on or otherwise you are going to reach maybe full potential from the volume growth perspective in the back half?\nKevin Boone: Yes Chris. Look, when you look at the transportation sector as a whole, we're not unique. Everyone is having their challenges. The fluidity out there is not very good right now when you look across all modes of transportation and those challenges we're facing the same challenges, getting trucks to pick up the boxes out of our yards, all those things create challenges for us so. Yes I'd say there was opportunity that we weren't able to move in the second quarter, that's probably a fair assessment. As we get more fluid, as we bring on crews, I suspect that that will generate opportunity. We're certainly having those conversations with our customers today. They want additional capacity and we're committed to do everything we can to react as quickly as we can to bring on more people, more capacity to serve those customer needs. We're already starting to have conversations around next year. So I'm communicating every day with Jamie when I'm having discussions with customers and what they need and so we can get out ahead of it with our resources. We can plan ahead, we can commit to delivering any other service that we expect to do.\nChristian Wetherbee: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great, good afternoon and congrats on the solid results. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the congestion that's going on, so obviously you just had a couple questions on employees and ability to handle it. I believe we've seen the two Western rails kind of do embargoes on traffic. Maybe talk a bit about, we've seen your metrics kind of come down in terms of on time performance, talk about if you're starting to see any of that spread to the Eastern network, is there different congestion points that especially what's going on in Chicago that you fear is starting to create any larger backlogs? And then just on that note, your cost per employee really scaled, can you address kind of, if there's anything in that that we should look at going forward? Thanks.\nJames Foote: Yes Ken it's Jim. I'll make a quick comment and then I'll let Jamie follow up with any details if things are necessary. We've been very, very, very committed to making sure that this railroad runs well. It has been an unbelievable challenge. I've never seen any kind of a thing like this in the transportation environment in my entire career where everything seems to be going sideways at the same time. Despite all that, we have been able to keep our terminals open in Chicago, and I hope we can continue to do that. In January when I got on this call, I said we were hiring because we anticipated growth. I fully expected that by now we would have about 500 new T&E employees on the property. No way did I or anybody else in the last six months realize how difficult it was going to be to try and get people to come to work these days. It is an enormous challenge for us to go out and find people that want to be conductors on the railroad, just like it's hard to find people that want to be baristas or anything else, it's very, very difficult. Nor did we anticipate that a lot of the people were going to decide they didn\u2019t want to work anymore. So attrition was much higher in the first half of the year than what we had expected. So even though we brought on 200 new employees, we fell short of where we thought we would be by now going into the year because we anticipated that there was going to be strong demand. We continue to expect there to be strong demand, and as long as there continues to be the forecast for demand, we are going to continue to hire employees, because you need employees to run a railroad. That's what we're managing this company to do, is to serve our customers needs, and we'll bring on the assets and put them into places where they need to be, so that we can move our customers' freight, simple as that.\nJamie Boychuk: I mean, I think Jim's comments really nailed it with respect to some of the headwinds that we've faced here with respect to the metrics and where they sit. I'm proud of what this team has been able to do under the environment we've been at, quite confident that in the environment we're in that Kevin and his team is providing us with some great numbers of what we need to look for going forward into the next six to eight months, as far as we can in this industry, but we know we can do better on these metrics and that's what I think is the great opportunity as an operating team as we look forward. We've got the rolling stock that we need. We've got the assets that are sitting there. It's people to Jim's point and I think it was mentioned by Amit it was 8% is what we look at for our attrition, which means we're going to be hiring for attrition, but we're going to be hiring for above attrition as well. We need to get 200 trainees out there, we mentioned that our T&E count is up a couple 100. You know there's more numbers. We know what our number is and we're going to go after that and for us it's all about the reliability to the customer. So as the fluidity picks up, as dwell continues to drop, yes we see some benefits there with costs and the rest of it as we move along, but ultimately, we look at our trip plan performance which is getting better and better, particularly on the intermodal side. On the carload side the reliability is where we need it to be. So we're going to take the steps required in order to get that reliability where it has to be and Kevin and his team are able to go out there and sell the product, which is service, and that's key for us. Without service we're not any different than anybody else, so we've got to continue to capture that which allows us to grow and continue to push forward. So maybe I'll let Sean really touch on the cost per employee.\nSean Pelkey: Yes Ken, just quickly on that. So if you're looking year-over-year there's a few things to think about, first is the incentive comp I called out. We've got inflation on the labor side and then we've got a little bit higher over time versus last year as we were obviously scaling down over time with the plummeting volumes. Just the other factor from last year, you remember we had those emergency reserve boards, so we had about 300 employees who didn't have significant wages along with their emergency status there. So looking from the first quarter we're actually down a little bit sequentially reflecting some normal seasonal trends.\nKen Hoexter: Great, thanks Jim, Sean, and Kevin, I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Your line is now open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. This is a question I think for Jim, maybe Kevin as well. You've talked about, I think for a couple of years about the opportunity with carload shippers to gain wallet share versus truck. And I think you were developing some good momentum or had some good momentum in that before COVID. I am wondering, it's an unusual circumstance, but does it hurt your ability to continue that program and to kind of gain further share from these shippers given that the rail network is having these challenges? I mean, they're not, a lot of it's not in your control, but how do you think that affects the ability to gain share? And when do you think you kind of get back on track with that share gain for carload shippers?\nJames Foote: Sure Tom. Many times we tried to explain why we're so confident in our ability to grow above traditional rates in our car load merchandise business was because we have if we can develop a product that's truck like we will have a cost advantage that gives the customer lower cost transportation solution, and it would be similar level of reliability. And as we were moving along as you said coming in starting in 2017 getting into the 2019, our reliability was significantly better than where it had been in 2017. Our car load trip plan compliance number was in the high 80%, mid to high 80% range. And so going in and having conversations with a customer who number one was skeptical about switching from truck to rail. We had a very good track record, and interesting product for him to look at. It's unfortunate and I now I have to sit here, much to my disillusionment and say our trip plan compliance number is 69. Is the 69 trip plan compliance much better than it was in 2017? Yes, so we still have the ability to have a good narrative with our customer base, about why it makes sense for them to switch, but it's just simply not as compelling as it was 18 months ago or 15 months ago, or just before the world went sideways on this, so but we're going to get back. That number would be much higher. As I said, the 500 employees that we hoped we would have had here by now, new conductors here by now, that number would have been much higher and we're hiring and doing whatever we possibly can do to run and improve the speed and velocity and reliability of our service and as we do we'll get back to having -- being in a position to having similar conversations with our customers as we did before. At the same time, and it ain't easy to find a truck right now. So it's unfortunate that we're not really, on the one hand we're not as good as we work, but on the other hand, if we -- when we get back to where we were, the opportunity right there is tremendous for us. So nothing has really changed about our optimism at all in terms of this strategy that will drive outsized growth for us as we move forward. It's just unfortunate, that as I said, the world went sideways on us here for a while. But we're coming back, we're coming back strong, and we'll be even better than where we were as we get more time to get things running right.\nTom Wadewitz: Is that something that bounces back quickly, like you could be on track and 2022 or do you think the shippers have some kind of readjustment period to reengage on that, that share gain discussion again?\nJames Foote: Again, I hope that our service metrics, as I said, I kind of said on the last call, we'd be in great shape by now, so yes, I expect those numbers to get back by the end of the year. And we position ourselves in the transportation community as it has an extremely good service product. So going into next year, again we're getting truck conversions now. Our intermodal growth to a large degree is coming from converting long haul over the road trucking to intermodal. Our growth in certain segments with certain customers in the car load side is coming at the expense of the truck. So we're still seeing that. I just think that the, again, we are not in, it's not as easy for themselves, the man or woman to go in and talk to a customer today about how great we are and why they should convert more traffic to rail than it was in the fall of 2019. It doesn't mean it's not achievable. It just means it's not as easy and we'll just have to work harder.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay, great. Thanks for all the perspective. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks, good afternoon, guys. So, Kevin, it feels like for now we've got a favorable environment for coal. Maybe just talk about what you're expecting from the volume and RPU standpoint on coal going forward. And then just separately, Jim, just any thoughts on the executive order and how you guys think about reacting responding in any way?\nKevin Boone: Yes, the coal market is similar to a lot of the other markets that we're, we talked about today is the same. Its demand is outstripping supply. You're having the coal mines trying to catch up. They've under invested, so they are catching up on some of their investments. They are having some of the same struggles we are on the people side. So we're seeing all that today. You see the underlying commodity prices, whether it's natural gas here in the U.S. or met coal prices internationally, and thermal coal prices internationally, they're all supportive of an uptick in volume and will start to lapse and continue to lapse some very easy comps into the back half of the year. So we do expect growth, but not back to the levels that we saw in 2019 and a lot of that is based on the supply chain continue to try to catch up with the demand. So we're already having discussions with our customers and what does it look like for next year and how do we continue to replenish inventories, particularly here on the domestic side, where inventory levels are very low. We're in a situation right now, where we're trying to keep inventory levels to above those critical levels, so they can continue to burn and serve their customers. But, the environment is quickly turned up, I had discussions last week, they didn't see this coming. They were surprised about how quickly the market recovered. And so we're all communicating and really trying to understand how they can do better, how they can on the supply side, and how we can deliver the transportation services so they can deliver to their end customer. But, very good outlook, when you look at RPU is a little bit on the international side that we'll see favorability, particularly on the met side, where our price follows the commodity price and domestic will be relatively similar kind of dynamics that you saw in the second quarter going forward, so good market there.\nJames Foote: Yes, Scott on the executive order, I guess when we first heard about it, before it had actually been released, it seemed like the administration had for some reason sitting out the railroads and steamship businesses. Once the full information got out, and we were able to digest it, and find out that it covered everything and everybody, and especially tech, we got a little better viewpoint of what it was all about. And it appears to be pretty much not a lot of new items in it, but if any, but the agenda as it relates to railroads, the agenda that has been moving for a long at the Surface Transportation Board for years. So it was kind of like, what are the other things that\u2019s going on at the Surface Transportation Board, and we're just kind of listed along with every other regulatory move afoot in all industries. And, it's really my personal opinion, it's really unfortunate, when the supply chain, all of these essential workers who have been doing an amazing job now in during a pandemic, are kind of singled out as, our railroad is made up of all these employees that are out there working, and all of these regulatory ideas, which are really pushed forward by industry lobbyists, who want to change the rules and regulations, decided at this point in time when everybody's working so hard, that we should suddenly upend and take advantage of a difficult time to try and push forward a regulatory agenda. So it's not much new. I was somewhat disillusioned about what it really was but we're used to handling it in and then we'll move forward.\nScott Group: Thank you for the time guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Your line is now open.\nFadi Chamoun: Yes, hi. I was on mute I'm sorry. A question on Quality Carriers, if you can give us maybe your first impression, if we had some communication with clients, how are they perceiving this combination? And secondly, as we go into 2022, I think you mentioned for this year, it's going to breakeven on an operating income basis. But as we go into 2022, how are you thinking about the contribution of that business to operating income?\nKevin Boone: This is Kevin. The quality integration of July 01 you could imagine we got our teams together and quickly after that our sales team along with Quality sales team, and their feedback so far from the customer has been overwhelmingly positive. They're looking for capacity in the market. We have several ongoing initiatives currently with customers that will offer that capacity that they're looking for. We're doing all of our diligence, making sure when we bring on the service, we communicate with Jamie and his team and that we can service that business to the standard that we expect. So there's -- we'll do it very carefully and very methodically, particularly in this market today. But this is a product that we knew that's going in because we did our diligence ahead of that, we surveyed our customers and we surveyed their customers and we asked them this is something that they feel is needed in the market. And the overwhelming response was, yes, we would like this in the market, they see the value. We will be thoughtful on how we bring it on. We have a lot of inbound customers calling us, looking to come up with additional solutions. And we'll bring those on. But it's been great so far. Our teams are working very, very closely together and we're working closely with others. And so they can understand the opportunities in ways that we're thinking about bringing in a lot more into the network. And I'll let Sean handle the financial side of it.\nSean Pelkey: Yes, and Fadi, so in terms of the financial impact as we get into next year, the core trucking business has truck like margins. So you can expect to see that next year, but it's about the conversion that Kevin has been talking about, when we're able to drive some of that business that's moving over the road today over to the rail, and do it on existing trains, the incrementals on that growth should be pretty significant. We've got to ramp that up over time. We need to make sure we've got the equipment and all the piping in place, but you should see a ramp up in that next year.\nFadi Chamoun: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. Jim, I wanted to clarify the comment you made earlier on the progression of car load trip plan compliance going forward. Are you saying that getting back to the mid to high 80s was possible by year end? And then from a resource perspective, we've talked a lot about headcount, but can you talk about your plans for redeploying locomotives in the back half of the year as well?\nJames Foote: Yes, I'll let Jamie talk about locomotives, but in terms of my goal to get back to where we were, yes we hope that we could. Where we are right now would be challenging associated with being able to hire people, I don't know if that's achievable. That's my goal. That's what I'd like to see happen. And then I'd like to see us get better from there. I can't say right now whether or not until something changes dramatically in the hiring situation, whether or not we'll be able to achieve that.\nJamie Boychuk: On the locomotive side, as we get faster, and we can improve our fluidity out there from even where we are now, we're going to need less locomotives. So the question isn't necessarily where our numbers at now. We are good with what we have for our locomotives. We still got hundreds of locomotives in storage. We've got a great rebuild program that we're continuing to do. We've got 60 rebuilt locomotives coming out here over the next three months, which will allow us to put down some more locomotives that aren't as fuel efficient. So we'll continue along that track and, nothing but continued opportunities, particularly on the technology side, as we continue to work with our zero-to-zero program through Trip Optimizer and Vitronics [ph]. There's a lot to gain as we continue to move forward on that front.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. Just wanted to ask Kevin for you just for an update on the land portfolio, the industrial pipeline, how you think those things are trending? If those conversations have really changed, given the demand backdrop, what's I guess your timeline expectations for site development or something like that that would come from those efforts it would be more noticeable. And then just to follow up on the question of labor and resources, it sounds like that's the key getting labor, but it also sounds like it's pretty hard for you and for everybody. So maybe you can just give us a sense of your confidence in that. And then if there's any other levers you can pull across the network the different asset deployments that will help you get there if the labor doesn't -- ends up being as hard as it looks right now.\nKevin Boone: Well, let me touch on the industrial development and how we're thinking about it. The pandemic really has changed the way how customers are viewing the supply chains and we're really what I'm posing the team to do is we need to be in our that conversation that they're reevaluating it. Are there new facilities, are there new warehousing, is there new production that they're going to want to onshore and how do we sell the opportunity to put that on CSX rail and they get well served. I think the customers understand the opportunity that that gives them in terms of options and be able to move their freight, particularly in an environment where our global supply chain can be challenged, that the freight, the railroads have been reliable and have continued to move freight throughout the pandemic. And they are increasingly seeing the value of that. So I'm excited about leveraging our real estate portfolio, we have a lot of ready sites that they can build on today. We're marketing that along with the real estate team closely and, seeing some traction there. So it's exciting. I think it's early, but I'm hopeful that we'll start to see a little bit more opportunity over the next 12 months as we get out and get in front of our customers there.\nJames Foote: On the labor side, I've been working really closely with our HR department, Diana Sorfleet and her crew. Really the last eight months it's been difficult, there's no question about it. We've gone through some ebbs and flows with our applications have come forward, making sure we get the right people to work in new jobs. Just recently, there's a couple of things that we've done that's helped us. We've come up with a deal with our conductor SMART-TD for an availability agreement, which allows us to work closely with our conductors and make sure that their availability is better than it has been. So that agreement has been successful here over the past couple of weeks, since it's kicked in. And believe it or not, being a fourth generation railroader, I'm a believer that sometimes the best people you get for railroads that stick around are actual people from railroad families. I think there's a few others around this table in the same situation. We have put a referral program together, offering incentives to our employees to refer people to our railroad to work for CSX, and we went from a application of just a few 100 people to I would say, within a two-week period, well over 1000 applicants that we're going through right now to bring on as conductors. So the pipeline has gotten very strong and this program has helped out and of course the referrals will then help people stick around until they understand the job is, they know what it's about, and understand the lifestyle. So this program is really going to help us move forward as we continue to do our hiring.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right, thanks for the time. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Hi, I was just wondering if you could talk a little about the international intermodal front, the issues that are out on the west coast and some of the gating procedures in Chicago. Do you think that's, is that or will that lead as we move towards peak season, retailers and others, perhaps diverting more traffic to the ports in the East Coast and could that lead to additional opportunity for you again, assuming your service could keep up. Thanks.\nJames Foote: Yes, I think, you really identified a trend here. The West Coast ports have struggled, particularly through the pandemic and as freight demand has really picked up here and, the secular trend that we continue to see more freight moving to the East Coast. This is another reason why I think the shippers are going to look for that option and that's the, that's a very good thing for our franchise in the east. We remained fluid. Jamie and his team have done a great job, working with all of our partner port partners to continue to move freight and so the intermodal terminals remain open. We continue to move freight and we want more of it. We're continuing to invest in inland ports and other areas to make sure that we can serve it.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Vernon with Sanford. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the time. Jamie, it's still unclear to me whether the resource initiatives you're having are a function of having custom deep kind of on the way down, or whether this is just sort of sand in the restart recruiting gears trying to get guys off of the item boards or whatever. Could you talk more specifically to what the core issue is here? And then as a follow up, Jim or Kevin, when do you start getting worried that the service relations you're having now are going to impact your ability to make hey on the -- be a pretty good market next year?\nJames Foote: A little fuzzy, but I think your question is, the issues associated with the employees and we're trying to hire people, correct?\nDavid Vernon: Yes.\nJames Foote: Yes. Now, we're not, I don't think, I think this is a trend for every business right now. It's a challenge. I think we're evolving in the way we think about this and have to try and figure out things to do to make these jobs more attractive. They're extremely good paying jobs, with extremely good benefits, with all kinds of other bells and whistles, but in today's world, that's not enough. So a lot of the things we're doing right now in terms of, as Jamie said getting referrals, doing this, doing that, going to fill the need on a short-term basis that I'm convinced, and I think the team is convinced that we need to kind of look at this from a long-term perspective and say, what do we really need to do to make sure that we have a stable, long-term pipeline of people that enjoy coming to work, and doing what they need to do. And, nice weekends, holidays, winter outside, all of that where people before kind of delight [ph] that, they don't want to do that anymore. So we have to look at the whole big picture and we'll do that, because we need employees to run railroads such as that. And so we're going to change our thoughts, our processes and throwing money at people these days is not the answer.\nDavid Vernon: And I guess the other question in there was whether and when you start to get worried that the service issues maybe you are having now, starts to impact your ability to kind of take rate up into 2022?\nJames Foote: Well, I think that the, I'm not worried right now, because I think we have plans in place that will get us where we need to be by the end of the year. As I said in my remarks earlier, we were caught somewhat surprised, and as much as we had a plan in place to get us to where we thought we needed to be and the issues that everybody is facing right now kind of flared up. But we have, it has been a full court press. Jamie and I are personally doing everything we possibly can to work with the union leadership to help us make them tremendous in response to making sure that we're ready and willing and able to serve our customers. So I feel pretty good about where we should be absolute working [indiscernible] and working [indiscernible] today. It is not like the pandemic is growing out there, hello, it's alive and well right here. So, who knows what things, what's going to happen in the next couple of weeks, couple of months? Well, let's assume that we have some reasonable health conditions in the country. I feel pretty good we'll go into 2022 rare positions and we will continue to make sure that we have a pipeline of labor coming at us all the time in the future.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC. Your line is now open.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much. I just have quickly, good afternoon everyone. I just wanted to come back on pricing. But I'd take a different angle in terms of how you're structuring or might be restructuring or changing at all. The type of contracts you're negotiating with your customers and in particular, we're in a period of high pricing, particularly in trucking and intermodal. And there are some questions whether that is sustainable? So my question to you is, are you changing or can you change at all the terms in your contract to lengthen them out to better capture and preserve the current pricing environment longer than you otherwise would have on your prior, under the structure of your prior contracts?\nJames Foote: Well, I don't think there's anything in this environment that changes our overall approach to how we go to market. It's about being transparent with the customer around the cost pressures that we're facing in our business. They get it. They're facing the same issues and having a discussion around that. I'm more interested about how we partner with our customers to grow their business and help them compete in the markets. Those are the things that I'm really focused about. We all realize we have to cover our costs. That's, that's really a secondary discussion. When it comes to the conversations I'm trying to have with the customer. I'm trying to understand how their business is being impacted today, what they expect, how they expect to grow next year, what can we do from a service, perspective to help them in our new markets, help them advantages in the markets and compete and win share, if they're winning in the market, we're going to win. And so a lot of those conversations are happening today. Certainly, we expect to cover our costs going forward, but really, it's a combination of volume growth, and we want to grow with our customers, and we want them to be successful growing their business going forward.\nKevin Boone: Yes, it wasn't so much to take advantage, but more to come to an agreement where okay, capacity is very tight, maybe a customer wants to lock in higher for longer, and you can accommodate that through longer terms. Just curious if any of that is coming up where customers wanting to -- desperate for capacity wants to lock in for longer and if you can, keep that pricing in as a result for longer as well, that sounds like that's not happening.\nJames Foote: No, look, I'm a 100% confident. I talk with Jamie every day that this network is going to get better and better and we're going to enter next year, able to service our customers. And we're having those discussions of how we bring on more volume. And what we're asking our customers to do is tell us what that volume looks like. So we can resource and prepare from a headcount perspective all the crews. We certainly have the locomotives. We have the assets out there to go and service that business. So we want to get ahead of that. It's been incredibly hard markets to predict what volumes are going to do and we've all been surprised about the shape of the recovery. But what we're trying to do and get out in front, so we know how much we need to hire and get way out ahead of it, to make sure that we're there for the customer going forward.\nWalter Spracklin: Makes sense. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is now open.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question about automotive where volumes are up a lot, but presumably not as much as they could be. So could you talk about the extent to which you have visibility to when the chip shortage might improve? And do you think that the pent-up demand that might be released once that happens could be a tailwind that could contribute to above trend volume growth into 2022?\nJames Foote: Well, and you're probably looking at the same data I am. You can't find a used car, you can't find a new car. It's another market where demand is outstripping supply. We're close to -- we stay close with our auto customers. We've seen rolling shutdowns and auto plants that we serve. And that continues to persist. When we came into the year we started to see the problem. The problem seems to continue to move to the right. It's going to impact our third quarter. And, the question remains, how long into the fourth quarter that goes and does it extend into next year? Are there going to be other supply constraints in the market, other materials that will provide shortages? It's a global supply chain and so what's the next thing that we could run out of? That's what we're all watching. But to stay in close with the customers and we do know there's pent-up demand are going into next year, that will help a of other markets that we serve, I think, the metals market, plastics, all those are inputs into the auto industry today. And hopefully it provides another incremental growth lever that will be pulled as we move into 2022. But there's, everybody sees that there's a lot of pent-up demand. The auto production today has continued to come down given the supply constraints out there.\nCherilyn Radbourne: That\u2019s all from me. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nRavi Shankar: Thank you. Good afternoon everyone. Couple of follow-ups. Jim, I wanted to follow up on your comment earlier that now throwing money is not going to solve the labor problem, which doesn't make sense, given some the structural issues. But in the near term, I think a lot of the other industries are throwing money the problem, whether it's trucking or fast food or retail or whatever. So I mean, are you saying that you're not going to go down that route at all or at what point do you do that? And also, kind of, how do we think about revenue per employee in the back half of the year?\nJames Foote: Well, I personally think that we're, as I said, we need to look at, fundamentally look at what we need to do to make sure that we have a content happy workforce over the long period of time. And so that's what we're trying to do. I think that's kind of the plan in most businesses, whether it's bringing on to work or whatever it is you might need to do to make your job more fulfilling, that's great. If I'm a trucking company or an intermodal company and I decide that the smart thing to do is to pay my truck driver a quarter of a million dollars a year to drive a truck and then as always happens in the trucking business. Not maybe next year, but the year after, when the bottom drops out and there is excess capacity all over the street and people are driving trucks for their rates in order to put gas in the tank, the business model doesn't work so good. So we try to take a longer term more holistic approach to managing our workforce.\nRavi Shankar: Got it. If I can squeeze in a follow up, the other revenue was about over $103 [ph] million this quarter. Is that a good run rate to look at for the back half of the year?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Ravi. So, that was impacted by the intermodal storage fees that, are due to the supply chain issues in the truck driver shortages that we've been talking about here. So, does that continue into the second half of the year? I think it depends on what happens with the persistence of those issues. But that's really the fundamental driver here in the second quarter. And then of course, you've got the quality impact that will hit other revenue in the second half. So don't forget about that as well.\nRavi Shankar: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Kevin, just a quick one for you in your new seat, are you going to start for the first time, what impact are scope three [ph] emissions having either for their interest in using the rail to give a bit more of their wallet or from your side, pitching the rail, in addition to your cost benefits, having a mission benefit as well as an opportunity to take more business?\nKevin Boone: Well, I can tell you, the environmental fits and definitely moved to the front of our marketing deck and when we discuss with customers. And, I think from the executive level down to starting to flow to the transportation buyers, they realized that\u2019s an initiative coming from the top, it's high priority. And we're an easy solution to solve through that. So it's something I've asked the sales team to continue to press. We are incorporating in every discussion we have going forward, and it's resonated, quite frankly. And so it's a huge, when I think about all the secular trends that are going to help CSX grow going forward, you have the driver shortage. I don't think it gets fixed anytime soon. That's a huge advantage for us. We can supply capacity into the market and then you have the environmental side. Very, very powerful, and it will continue to grow. We've seen all the things that have happened in the market. Investors want it. Our employees want it and our customers and the consumer wants it. So it's something I'm incredibly passionate about. We're going to continue to sell it and it's pretty exciting.\nJonathan Chappell: Have you seen it translate yet or do you think it's more of just like the immediate future?\nKevin Boone: I think it's always -- it's hard to measure, but we win that business because we're more environmentally friendly than the truck. It's another reason we're winning business today. The other reason, obviously capacity constrained, we can \u2013 we have capacity, we're going to continue to grow capacity it will recover. I'm confident our operating team is going to recover, and we're going to have the best most capacity to offer our customers going into the next year. It is simple as that and so, all those factors play into why we're winning business, why we're winning in the market. But, the tailwinds are there. From a growth perspective it's just, I don\u2019t know -- my responsibility along with Jamie to go out and deliver on that.\nJonathan Chappell: Got it. Thanks, Kevin.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Your line is now open.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Thank you very much and thank you for squeezing me in. Sadly, all the intelligent questions have been asked at this point. But let me just come back to the customer side, Jim, because that seems to be a focus in the market side right now. If you had your ability to put all the people you want in the railroad today, and you talked about the challenge and getting to the 500 T&E by this summer, but let's just say you could and you could fix that element of what's going on, how much of the service and the trip plan issues would that solve? Because when I talk to transport companies, they tell me, yes well customers are holding on to equipment a little longer than they should or we've had trouble getting our equipment back or just timely handoffs with some of our other service partners. How much would be fixed, if you had every asset internally that you wanted?\nJames Foote: The employee issue, the Train and Engine service employee issue, will clean up a vast majority of the issues we have that show up and what we call our trip plan compliance number, will improve our velocity, will drive down our dwell. There will still be the noise in the supply chain. It's not going to correct as shortage of chassis, that's not going to correct a shortage of containers or draining or port congestion and that sort of thing, but it will and so therefore it's not Nirvana, but it will certainly help us in terms of being able to improve the overall reliability of our product again, and get it back to where it was, so we can focus on making even better and better.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Okay, so you would say the lion's share of getting to where you need to be is something you can handle internally with more resources?\nJames Foote: Yes, I mean, we've always said that. I mean we've -- by changing, fundamentally changing the way this company runs over the last almost four years now, we've freed up capacity across the network. We have significant amount of track capacity so we can add growth without investing in track capacity. As Jamie said earlier, we have locomotives available. We have locomotives on standby. We have locomotives in storage if we need to use them. So yes, the impediment to our performance right now is primarily, if not exclusively, I'd like to say it's primarily because certainly in this business, you have to throw in the occasional pandemic or hurricane. But primarily when we can hire, if I figure out ways, like everybody else in the country, to replenish our workforce, the problem was, we had a pandemic. We didn't hire during the pandemic because the business went away. We have 7% of our workforce that retires every year. 7% of our workforce retired, we thought, okay, the business bounced back, we'll hire 7% of our employees back plus a little bit more to handle the growth. And they're not available. So yes, we'll fix that. It's just taking us longer than we expected and when we get that done, the railroad will be back running the way it did before and we'll get it even better.\nJeffrey Kauffman: Okay, congratulations to you and your team in a very challenging environment. Thank you.\nJames Foote: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Foote",
            "content": "Great, thanks Bill, and thank you for joining us on the call today. This quarter's results highlight just how quickly volumes have rebounded as each of our three lines of business experienced record growth as we lapped the most severe economic impacts of the pandemic. I want to first thank all of the CSX's railroaders for their unwavering commitment to our customers as they worked very hard to deliver service in a very difficult operating environment. As we enter the second half of the year, our focus is squarely on continuing this growth. We have kept our yards and terminals open and freight moving throughout the recovery and we will continue taking the necessary steps to add resources and increase fluidity in order to help customers meet their own growth targets this year despite the ongoing supply chain disruptions. Let's begin with Slide 5 in the presentation and an overview of our second quarter financial results. Operating income increased to $1.69 billion and earnings per share rose to $0.52. These figures include $349 million and $0.12 per share impact from the sale of property rights to the Commonwealth of Virginia. Our operating ratio was 43.4 including an 11.7 percentage point impact from the Virginia transaction. Excluding these impacts, operating income increased 62%, earnings per share increased 82%, and the operating ratio improved 820 basis points. Turning to Slide 6, revenue increased 33% on 27% volume growth. Merchandise revenue increased 26% on 21% higher volumes led by automotive, metals and equipment and Ag improved markets. Intermodal revenue increased 42% on 28% volume growth setting a new record for average daily volume. Both domestic and international volumes increased significantly and continued to benefit from strong demand for transportation services as well as growth from East Coast ports. Coal revenue increased 47% on 44% higher volumes with growth across all core markets. Domestic coal benefited from higher utility and industrial demand in both export net and thermal coal volumes rebounded meaningfully. Other revenue growth was driven by increased intermodal storage and equipment usage as well as higher revenue from affiliates. Turning to Slide 7, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. In the second quarter we achieved a new record low number of train accidents driven by our focus on increased communication and education to reduce human factor caused accidents. Safety initiatives for the remainder of the year will focus on culture, communication, and continuous education. As an example, we've recently introduced a modified approach to operational testing for T&E employees. The new program is designed to be instructive rather than disciplinary to increase employee engagement and create lasting changes in behavior. Combined with face to face safety summits and expanded education of top causes of incidents, these new programs will further reduce risk and protect our workforce. Moving to Slide 8, let's review this quarter's operating metrics. The intermodal segment continues to perform well. Intermodal trip plan performance averaged 89% for the quarter and through this of our reservation system and the hard work of our intermodal team, we have kept all our intermodal terminals open over the last year as volumes surged. Carload trip plan performance improved sequentially to 69% for the quarter and we are focused on continuing this positive momentum throughout the rest of the year. We are also working to further improve network fluidity. Car dwell improved sequentially and remains the lowest in the industry. Velocity began to turn positively exiting the quarter and we expect to see further improvements in both metrics in the second half of the year. On Slide 9, I want to take the opportunity to highlight some of the actions we are taking to resource the network for growth. As I mentioned on previous calls, we entered the year planning to add community headcount in response to the expected growth and we'll continue adding through the second half of the year. Over the past several months we have increased the size and number of our new conductor classes and then also enacted new programs to improve availability of existing employees to ensure that we have resources in place to capture the rising demand and serve our customers well. We staged locomotives across the network as we prepared for the incremental volumes. While these assets provide additional flexibility to react to customer demand, we are maintaining a balanced operating plan and we are investing in the safety and reliability of our network. We demonstrated this commitment by maintaining our capital spend throughout the pandemic and we continue to invest with a focus on the long-term growth and sustainability of our business. We still have ample capacity across the network for growth and we are working to find new ways to improve the efficiency and impact of our capital spending programs. Turning to Slide 10, our focus on investing for the future extends through improving the safety, productivity and sustainability of CSX's operations through the increased use of technology, while we are driving further emissions reductions through our advancement of energy management software and the expanded use of fuel saving technologies. In addition to the almost 40% increase in distributed powertrains year-over-year, we continue to expand the number of distributed power equipped locomotives. We are adding that capability to approximately 100 locomotives this year in addition to including that in all the locomotive rebuilds we are performing. We are also expanding use of inspection technologies to improve the safety of our operations and then increase the efficacy of our track maintenance and repair programs. We are performing roughly 80% of our drone inspection flights this year and our increased use of autonomous track inspections cars with improving safety by better highlighting areas in need of repair. Lastly, we are providing our field employees with digital tools to replace inefficient manual or paper based processes to increase the speed of communication across the railroad. We have distributed roughly 9000 tablets to employees which are improving both safety and productivity by allowing real time information sharing and feedback. We are pleased with the success of these programs to date and we are only beginning to see the potential value these investments can bring. With more efficient network planning and dispatching we are changing our customers interactive CSX. We see significant opportunities to leverage technology to improve the pace and quality of decision making across our business. I'll now turn it over to Sean to run through the numbers. Great, thanks, Sean. Concluding with Slide 15, we are maintaining a full year revenue outlook. Excluding the impact from Quality Carriers, we continue to project double-digit revenue growth for the year. As Sean mentioned, the acquisition will add approximately 6% incremental revenue growth on an annualized basis, and we expect the impact this year to be about half of that. We will achieve these growth targets by providing our customers with a high quality service product. As I said, we are taking necessary steps to ensure we deliver on this commitment. Our capital expenditure outlook remains at $1.7 to $1.8 billion for the year and we will continue returning cash to shareholders. Demand remains strong and so does our commitment to customers. We are resourcing the network for growth. We are driving operational improvements to add capacity through increased asset utilization. We are investing in our business for the long-term and we continue to design new and creative solutions through our customers to move more freight with CSX today, and for years to come. Now back to Bill for the Q&A. Yes Ken it's Jim. I'll make a quick comment and then I'll let Jamie follow up with any details if things are necessary. We've been very, very, very committed to making sure that this railroad runs well. It has been an unbelievable challenge. I've never seen any kind of a thing like this in the transportation environment in my entire career where everything seems to be going sideways at the same time. Despite all that, we have been able to keep our terminals open in Chicago, and I hope we can continue to do that. In January when I got on this call, I said we were hiring because we anticipated growth. I fully expected that by now we would have about 500 new T&E employees on the property. No way did I or anybody else in the last six months realize how difficult it was going to be to try and get people to come to work these days. It is an enormous challenge for us to go out and find people that want to be conductors on the railroad, just like it's hard to find people that want to be baristas or anything else, it's very, very difficult. Nor did we anticipate that a lot of the people were going to decide they didn't want to work anymore. So attrition was much higher in the first half of the year than what we had expected. So even though we brought on 200 new employees, we fell short of where we thought we would be by now going into the year because we anticipated that there was going to be strong demand. We continue to expect there to be strong demand, and as long as there continues to be the forecast for demand, we are going to continue to hire employees, because you need employees to run a railroad. That's what we're managing this company to do, is to serve our customers needs, and we'll bring on the assets and put them into places where they need to be, so that we can move our customers' freight, simple as that. Sure Tom. Many times we tried to explain why we're so confident in our ability to grow above traditional rates in our car load merchandise business was because we have if we can develop a product that's truck like we will have a cost advantage that gives the customer lower cost transportation solution, and it would be similar level of reliability. And as we were moving along as you said coming in starting in 2017 getting into the 2019, our reliability was significantly better than where it had been in 2017. Our car load trip plan compliance number was in the high 80%, mid to high 80% range. And so going in and having conversations with a customer who number one was skeptical about switching from truck to rail. We had a very good track record, and interesting product for him to look at. It's unfortunate and I now I have to sit here, much to my disillusionment and say our trip plan compliance number is 69. Is the 69 trip plan compliance much better than it was in 2017? Yes, so we still have the ability to have a good narrative with our customer base, about why it makes sense for them to switch, but it's just simply not as compelling as it was 18 months ago or 15 months ago, or just before the world went sideways on this, so but we're going to get back. That number would be much higher. As I said, the 500 employees that we hoped we would have had here by now, new conductors here by now, that number would have been much higher and we're hiring and doing whatever we possibly can do to run and improve the speed and velocity and reliability of our service and as we do we'll get back to having -- being in a position to having similar conversations with our customers as we did before. At the same time, and it ain't easy to find a truck right now. So it's unfortunate that we're not really, on the one hand we're not as good as we work, but on the other hand, if we -- when we get back to where we were, the opportunity right there is tremendous for us. So nothing has really changed about our optimism at all in terms of this strategy that will drive outsized growth for us as we move forward. It's just unfortunate, that as I said, the world went sideways on us here for a while. But we're coming back, we're coming back strong, and we'll be even better than where we were as we get more time to get things running right. Again, I hope that our service metrics, as I said, I kind of said on the last call, we'd be in great shape by now, so yes, I expect those numbers to get back by the end of the year. And we position ourselves in the transportation community as it has an extremely good service product. So going into next year, again we're getting truck conversions now. Our intermodal growth to a large degree is coming from converting long haul over the road trucking to intermodal. Our growth in certain segments with certain customers in the car load side is coming at the expense of the truck. So we're still seeing that. I just think that the, again, we are not in, it's not as easy for themselves, the man or woman to go in and talk to a customer today about how great we are and why they should convert more traffic to rail than it was in the fall of 2019. It doesn't mean it's not achievable. It just means it's not as easy and we'll just have to work harder. Yes, Scott on the executive order, I guess when we first heard about it, before it had actually been released, it seemed like the administration had for some reason sitting out the railroads and steamship businesses. Once the full information got out, and we were able to digest it, and find out that it covered everything and everybody, and especially tech, we got a little better viewpoint of what it was all about. And it appears to be pretty much not a lot of new items in it, but if any, but the agenda as it relates to railroads, the agenda that has been moving for a long at the Surface Transportation Board for years. So it was kind of like, what are the other things that's going on at the Surface Transportation Board, and we're just kind of listed along with every other regulatory move afoot in all industries. And, it's really my personal opinion, it's really unfortunate, when the supply chain, all of these essential workers who have been doing an amazing job now in during a pandemic, are kind of singled out as, our railroad is made up of all these employees that are out there working, and all of these regulatory ideas, which are really pushed forward by industry lobbyists, who want to change the rules and regulations, decided at this point in time when everybody's working so hard, that we should suddenly upend and take advantage of a difficult time to try and push forward a regulatory agenda. So it's not much new. I was somewhat disillusioned about what it really was but we're used to handling it in and then we'll move forward. Yes, I'll let Jamie talk about locomotives, but in terms of my goal to get back to where we were, yes we hope that we could. Where we are right now would be challenging associated with being able to hire people, I don't know if that's achievable. That's my goal. That's what I'd like to see happen. And then I'd like to see us get better from there. I can't say right now whether or not until something changes dramatically in the hiring situation, whether or not we'll be able to achieve that. On the labor side, I've been working really closely with our HR department, Diana Sorfleet and her crew. Really the last eight months it's been difficult, there's no question about it. We've gone through some ebbs and flows with our applications have come forward, making sure we get the right people to work in new jobs. Just recently, there's a couple of things that we've done that's helped us. We've come up with a deal with our conductor SMART-TD for an availability agreement, which allows us to work closely with our conductors and make sure that their availability is better than it has been. So that agreement has been successful here over the past couple of weeks, since it's kicked in. And believe it or not, being a fourth generation railroader, I'm a believer that sometimes the best people you get for railroads that stick around are actual people from railroad families. I think there's a few others around this table in the same situation. We have put a referral program together, offering incentives to our employees to refer people to our railroad to work for CSX, and we went from a application of just a few 100 people to I would say, within a two-week period, well over 1000 applicants that we're going through right now to bring on as conductors. So the pipeline has gotten very strong and this program has helped out and of course the referrals will then help people stick around until they understand the job is, they know what it's about, and understand the lifestyle. So this program is really going to help us move forward as we continue to do our hiring. Yes, I think, you really identified a trend here. The West Coast ports have struggled, particularly through the pandemic and as freight demand has really picked up here and, the secular trend that we continue to see more freight moving to the East Coast. This is another reason why I think the shippers are going to look for that option and that's the, that's a very good thing for our franchise in the east. We remained fluid. Jamie and his team have done a great job, working with all of our partner port partners to continue to move freight and so the intermodal terminals remain open. We continue to move freight and we want more of it. We're continuing to invest in inland ports and other areas to make sure that we can serve it. A little fuzzy, but I think your question is, the issues associated with the employees and we're trying to hire people, correct? Yes. Now, we're not, I don't think, I think this is a trend for every business right now. It's a challenge. I think we're evolving in the way we think about this and have to try and figure out things to do to make these jobs more attractive. They're extremely good paying jobs, with extremely good benefits, with all kinds of other bells and whistles, but in today's world, that's not enough. So a lot of the things we're doing right now in terms of, as Jamie said getting referrals, doing this, doing that, going to fill the need on a short-term basis that I'm convinced, and I think the team is convinced that we need to kind of look at this from a long-term perspective and say, what do we really need to do to make sure that we have a stable, long-term pipeline of people that enjoy coming to work, and doing what they need to do. And, nice weekends, holidays, winter outside, all of that where people before kind of delight [ph] that, they don't want to do that anymore. So we have to look at the whole big picture and we'll do that, because we need employees to run railroads such as that. And so we're going to change our thoughts, our processes and throwing money at people these days is not the answer. Well, I think that the, I'm not worried right now, because I think we have plans in place that will get us where we need to be by the end of the year. As I said in my remarks earlier, we were caught somewhat surprised, and as much as we had a plan in place to get us to where we thought we needed to be and the issues that everybody is facing right now kind of flared up. But we have, it has been a full court press. Jamie and I are personally doing everything we possibly can to work with the union leadership to help us make them tremendous in response to making sure that we're ready and willing and able to serve our customers. So I feel pretty good about where we should be absolute working [indiscernible] and working [indiscernible] today. It is not like the pandemic is growing out there, hello, it's alive and well right here. So, who knows what things, what's going to happen in the next couple of weeks, couple of months? Well, let's assume that we have some reasonable health conditions in the country. I feel pretty good we'll go into 2022 rare positions and we will continue to make sure that we have a pipeline of labor coming at us all the time in the future. Well, I don't think there's anything in this environment that changes our overall approach to how we go to market. It's about being transparent with the customer around the cost pressures that we're facing in our business. They get it. They're facing the same issues and having a discussion around that. I'm more interested about how we partner with our customers to grow their business and help them compete in the markets. Those are the things that I'm really focused about. We all realize we have to cover our costs. That's, that's really a secondary discussion. When it comes to the conversations I'm trying to have with the customer. I'm trying to understand how their business is being impacted today, what they expect, how they expect to grow next year, what can we do from a service, perspective to help them in our new markets, help them advantages in the markets and compete and win share, if they're winning in the market, we're going to win. And so a lot of those conversations are happening today. Certainly, we expect to cover our costs going forward, but really, it's a combination of volume growth, and we want to grow with our customers, and we want them to be successful growing their business going forward. No, look, I'm a 100% confident. I talk with Jamie every day that this network is going to get better and better and we're going to enter next year, able to service our customers. And we're having those discussions of how we bring on more volume. And what we're asking our customers to do is tell us what that volume looks like. So we can resource and prepare from a headcount perspective all the crews. We certainly have the locomotives. We have the assets out there to go and service that business. So we want to get ahead of that. It's been incredibly hard markets to predict what volumes are going to do and we've all been surprised about the shape of the recovery. But what we're trying to do and get out in front, so we know how much we need to hire and get way out ahead of it, to make sure that we're there for the customer going forward. Well, and you're probably looking at the same data I am. You can't find a used car, you can't find a new car. It's another market where demand is outstripping supply. We're close to -- we stay close with our auto customers. We've seen rolling shutdowns and auto plants that we serve. And that continues to persist. When we came into the year we started to see the problem. The problem seems to continue to move to the right. It's going to impact our third quarter. And, the question remains, how long into the fourth quarter that goes and does it extend into next year? Are there going to be other supply constraints in the market, other materials that will provide shortages? It's a global supply chain and so what's the next thing that we could run out of? That's what we're all watching. But to stay in close with the customers and we do know there's pent-up demand are going into next year, that will help a of other markets that we serve, I think, the metals market, plastics, all those are inputs into the auto industry today. And hopefully it provides another incremental growth lever that will be pulled as we move into 2022. But there's, everybody sees that there's a lot of pent-up demand. The auto production today has continued to come down given the supply constraints out there. Well, I personally think that we're, as I said, we need to look at, fundamentally look at what we need to do to make sure that we have a content happy workforce over the long period of time. And so that's what we're trying to do. I think that's kind of the plan in most businesses, whether it's bringing on to work or whatever it is you might need to do to make your job more fulfilling, that's great. If I'm a trucking company or an intermodal company and I decide that the smart thing to do is to pay my truck driver a quarter of a million dollars a year to drive a truck and then as always happens in the trucking business. Not maybe next year, but the year after, when the bottom drops out and there is excess capacity all over the street and people are driving trucks for their rates in order to put gas in the tank, the business model doesn't work so good. So we try to take a longer term more holistic approach to managing our workforce. The employee issue, the Train and Engine service employee issue, will clean up a vast majority of the issues we have that show up and what we call our trip plan compliance number, will improve our velocity, will drive down our dwell. There will still be the noise in the supply chain. It's not going to correct as shortage of chassis, that's not going to correct a shortage of containers or draining or port congestion and that sort of thing, but it will and so therefore it's not Nirvana, but it will certainly help us in terms of being able to improve the overall reliability of our product again, and get it back to where it was, so we can focus on making even better and better. Yes, I mean, we've always said that. I mean we've -- by changing, fundamentally changing the way this company runs over the last almost four years now, we've freed up capacity across the network. We have significant amount of track capacity so we can add growth without investing in track capacity. As Jamie said earlier, we have locomotives available. We have locomotives on standby. We have locomotives in storage if we need to use them. So yes, the impediment to our performance right now is primarily, if not exclusively, I'd like to say it's primarily because certainly in this business, you have to throw in the occasional pandemic or hurricane. But primarily when we can hire, if I figure out ways, like everybody else in the country, to replenish our workforce, the problem was, we had a pandemic. We didn't hire during the pandemic because the business went away. We have 7% of our workforce that retires every year. 7% of our workforce retired, we thought, okay, the business bounced back, we'll hire 7% of our employees back plus a little bit more to handle the growth. And they're not available. So yes, we'll fix that. It's just taking us longer than we expected and when we get that done, the railroad will be back running the way it did before and we'll get it even better. Thank you."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Hey Allison, this is Kevin. In terms of price inflation today, and cost inflation what we are seeing and I'm keeping close with Sean and staying close to that so we can be transparent with our customers and explain to them what we're seeing in the market, none of that is a surprise to them. They're seeing it in their business. They certainly understand the pressures that are out there in terms of labor and other material costs. What we're really trying to do is see if some of these things are transitory or whether they're really here for the long term and we'll continue to evaluate that throughout the year. When you look at generally our contracts we have a lot of those renewals that occur in the fourth and first quarter. They're concentrated in those quarters and really it represents about 70% of our annual contract renewal activity, so we'll continue to look at that. We're communicating transparent with our customers and expect to obviously achieve that cost inflation through our pricing. Yes Chris. Look, when you look at the transportation sector as a whole, we're not unique. Everyone is having their challenges. The fluidity out there is not very good right now when you look across all modes of transportation and those challenges we're facing the same challenges, getting trucks to pick up the boxes out of our yards, all those things create challenges for us so. Yes I'd say there was opportunity that we weren't able to move in the second quarter, that's probably a fair assessment. As we get more fluid, as we bring on crews, I suspect that that will generate opportunity. We're certainly having those conversations with our customers today. They want additional capacity and we're committed to do everything we can to react as quickly as we can to bring on more people, more capacity to serve those customer needs. We're already starting to have conversations around next year. So I'm communicating every day with Jamie when I'm having discussions with customers and what they need and so we can get out ahead of it with our resources. We can plan ahead, we can commit to delivering any other service that we expect to do. Yes, the coal market is similar to a lot of the other markets that we're, we talked about today is the same. Its demand is outstripping supply. You're having the coal mines trying to catch up. They've under invested, so they are catching up on some of their investments. They are having some of the same struggles we are on the people side. So we're seeing all that today. You see the underlying commodity prices, whether it's natural gas here in the U.S. or met coal prices internationally, and thermal coal prices internationally, they're all supportive of an uptick in volume and will start to lapse and continue to lapse some very easy comps into the back half of the year. So we do expect growth, but not back to the levels that we saw in 2019 and a lot of that is based on the supply chain continue to try to catch up with the demand. So we're already having discussions with our customers and what does it look like for next year and how do we continue to replenish inventories, particularly here on the domestic side, where inventory levels are very low. We're in a situation right now, where we're trying to keep inventory levels to above those critical levels, so they can continue to burn and serve their customers. But, the environment is quickly turned up, I had discussions last week, they didn't see this coming. They were surprised about how quickly the market recovered. And so we're all communicating and really trying to understand how they can do better, how they can on the supply side, and how we can deliver the transportation services so they can deliver to their end customer. But, very good outlook, when you look at RPU is a little bit on the international side that we'll see favorability, particularly on the met side, where our price follows the commodity price and domestic will be relatively similar kind of dynamics that you saw in the second quarter going forward, so good market there. This is Kevin. The quality integration of July 01 you could imagine we got our teams together and quickly after that our sales team along with Quality sales team, and their feedback so far from the customer has been overwhelmingly positive. They're looking for capacity in the market. We have several ongoing initiatives currently with customers that will offer that capacity that they're looking for. We're doing all of our diligence, making sure when we bring on the service, we communicate with Jamie and his team and that we can service that business to the standard that we expect. So there's -- we'll do it very carefully and very methodically, particularly in this market today. But this is a product that we knew that's going in because we did our diligence ahead of that, we surveyed our customers and we surveyed their customers and we asked them this is something that they feel is needed in the market. And the overwhelming response was, yes, we would like this in the market, they see the value. We will be thoughtful on how we bring it on. We have a lot of inbound customers calling us, looking to come up with additional solutions. And we'll bring those on. But it's been great so far. Our teams are working very, very closely together and we're working closely with others. And so they can understand the opportunities in ways that we're thinking about bringing in a lot more into the network. And I'll let Sean handle the financial side of it. Well, let me touch on the industrial development and how we're thinking about it. The pandemic really has changed the way how customers are viewing the supply chains and we're really what I'm posing the team to do is we need to be in our that conversation that they're reevaluating it. Are there new facilities, are there new warehousing, is there new production that they're going to want to onshore and how do we sell the opportunity to put that on CSX rail and they get well served. I think the customers understand the opportunity that that gives them in terms of options and be able to move their freight, particularly in an environment where our global supply chain can be challenged, that the freight, the railroads have been reliable and have continued to move freight throughout the pandemic. And they are increasingly seeing the value of that. So I'm excited about leveraging our real estate portfolio, we have a lot of ready sites that they can build on today. We're marketing that along with the real estate team closely and, seeing some traction there. So it's exciting. I think it's early, but I'm hopeful that we'll start to see a little bit more opportunity over the next 12 months as we get out and get in front of our customers there. Yes, it wasn't so much to take advantage, but more to come to an agreement where okay, capacity is very tight, maybe a customer wants to lock in higher for longer, and you can accommodate that through longer terms. Just curious if any of that is coming up where customers wanting to -- desperate for capacity wants to lock in for longer and if you can, keep that pricing in as a result for longer as well, that sounds like that's not happening. Well, I can tell you, the environmental fits and definitely moved to the front of our marketing deck and when we discuss with customers. And, I think from the executive level down to starting to flow to the transportation buyers, they realized that's an initiative coming from the top, it's high priority. And we're an easy solution to solve through that. So it's something I've asked the sales team to continue to press. We are incorporating in every discussion we have going forward, and it's resonated, quite frankly. And so it's a huge, when I think about all the secular trends that are going to help CSX grow going forward, you have the driver shortage. I don't think it gets fixed anytime soon. That's a huge advantage for us. We can supply capacity into the market and then you have the environmental side. Very, very powerful, and it will continue to grow. We've seen all the things that have happened in the market. Investors want it. Our employees want it and our customers and the consumer wants it. So it's something I'm incredibly passionate about. We're going to continue to sell it and it's pretty exciting. I think it's always -- it's hard to measure, but we win that business because we're more environmentally friendly than the truck. It's another reason we're winning business today. The other reason, obviously capacity constrained, we can \u2013 we have capacity, we're going to continue to grow capacity it will recover. I'm confident our operating team is going to recover, and we're going to have the best most capacity to offer our customers going into the next year. It is simple as that and so, all those factors play into why we're winning business, why we're winning in the market. But, the tailwinds are there. From a growth perspective it's just, I don't know -- my responsibility along with Jamie to go out and deliver on that."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. I'm pleased to be here today and I'm excited for the opportunity to continue serving this company at an important time in our history as we focus on culture, innovation and growth. Looking at the second quarter financial results on Slide 12, revenue increased $735 million or 33% versus the prior year. This reflects growth across every market as we cycle the impacts of COVID-19. Revenue per unit growth of 5% includes a 2% impact from higher fuel surcharge revenue, combined with favorable pricing and higher other revenue. Total expenses were 9% lower in the quarter. These results included a $349 million gain related to the sale of property rights to Virginia which was partially offset by the impact of higher fuel price. Excluding the property gain and the impact of fuel price, expenses would have been up 9% on a volume increase of 27%. Before I get into specifics by line, I would like to address the topic of inflation. The good news is, we have secured adequate inventory and supply commitments for critical materials and we've worked to lock in the vast majority of unit costs for 2021. Excluding locomotive fuel, expense inflation this quarter was just above 3% and we don't expect that to move much going into the second half. We are seeing cost pressures on capital materials for core infrastructure and are working to offset that through increased productivity, sourcing shifts and inventory management. We don't expect any change to the overall capital budget this year. Several of our supplier contracts are based on lagging indicators, so we will continue to monitor things closely going into next year and ensure inventory levels for critical materials remain adequate. Now, moving down to the specific expense line items for Q2, labor and fringe was up 18%. Higher volume and inflation together drove a $75 million increase in expense. Additionally, incentive compensation increased $60 million on higher projections for award payouts this year coupled with prior year downward adjustments related to COVID impacts. We continue to absorb growth on the network and sustain productivity gains. As we work to hire conductors, we've increased the use of distributed power and continue to optimize the plan. While total headcount is roughly flat from year-end 2020, the active T&E count is up approximately 200 this year, and we expect continued sequential increases in the third and fourth quarters. MS&O expense increased 6% or $23 million in the second quarter as higher volumes and inflation were the primary drivers. Locomotive productivity measured in GTMs per available horsepower hour improved 4% compared to the second quarter of last year. We expect this to improve even further going forward as velocity and cycle times recover. In addition, we are absorbing growth and driving efficiencies at our intermodal terminals with cost per container lift down 12% year-over-year. Fuel expense increased $103 million driven by average fuel prices that nearly doubled as well as higher volume. During the quarter we also recorded an $18 million benefit related to the settlement of the state fuel tax matter. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $4 million in the quarter primarily due to a larger asset base. Equipment rent expense increased $9 million or 12%. The impact of higher volume on freight car rents was partially offset by higher net earnings at affiliates. As a result of the Virginia transaction, gains on property dispositions increased significantly in the second quarter. As a reminder, the gain during the quarter was related to the first phase of the transaction. Total proceeds are expected to be $525 million including $200 million already received, $200 million later this year, and the remaining $125 million expected next year. Turning below the line, interest expense improved $10 million, due to a lower weighted average coupon and lower average debt balances. Other income increased $5 million as favorable pension impacts were partially offset by lower interest on cash held. Income tax expense increased $204 million, mostly due to higher pre-tax income. The effective tax rate was 23.3% and was impacted by a state legislative change this quarter. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.7 billion. The reported operating ratio was 43.4%, including a benefit of approximately 1200 basis points from property gains. Now these results do not include any impact from the Quality Carriers acquisition, which closed on July 1. The acquisition will add approximately 6% to CSX's revenue, and is expected to be relatively neutral to operating income and EPS this year due to the impact of transaction and integration related expenses. Quality tracking revenue will be recorded in the other revenue line. On the cost side, about two thirds of the expense will be MS&O. About one quarter of it is split between labor and fuel with the rest hitting depreciation and rents. Going forward we expect to leverage the Quality transaction to accelerate rail growth by offering new multimodal products, extending our reach and further integrating CSX into our customers supply chains. Now turning to cash flow on Slide 13. As you know, free cash flow is a major focus for this team. Through the second quarter free cash flow before dividends was $1.9 billion up 35% versus the prior year. Just to put that in context, that's $300 million more free cash flow than we generated in all of 2017. Year-to-date free cash flow conversion on net income is 100%, and we expect it to remain near that level on a full year basis. The company's cash balance remains elevated at nearly $3 billion. Our expectation remains that this will normalize over time as we continue to invest in the business, and return capital to shareholders. Year-to-date shareholder returns are nearly $1.7 billion, including approximately $1.3 billion in buybacks and $400 million in dividends. We remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders with a balanced and opportunistic approach to buybacks. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Yes, thanks Amit. So, when you think about the second quarter, not a whole lot of unique items in there other than Virginia transaction, and then I talked about the impact of the fuel tax settlement there. So strip those out and carry it forward to the second half of the year, what's going to impact the operating ratio in the second half of the year Quality, you're right, I think you're doing the math correctly there. We've got some hiring to do, so we're going to be bringing on some crews. If we bring on the crews and network fluidity improves and we're able to move the volume that will be a positive, but there'll be a cost to bringing those crews on. We'll also going to have some incentives here to increase the availability of crews. So that will be an impact. And then, probably the biggest variable is what does volume look like in the second half. We've been able to demonstrate here, albeit on a relatively easy comp that the drop through is pretty good, but the margins in the second half will be highly dependent on what the volume looks like. Yes, so I mean, we're going to continue hiring through the rest of the year and as long as we need to in order to move the volume and increase fluidity. I would expect sequential headcount is probably going to go up a little bit on a net basis, both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. Yes Ken, just quickly on that. So if you're looking year-over-year there's a few things to think about, first is the incentive comp I called out. We've got inflation on the labor side and then we've got a little bit higher over time versus last year as we were obviously scaling down over time with the plummeting volumes. Just the other factor from last year, you remember we had those emergency reserve boards, so we had about 300 employees who didn't have significant wages along with their emergency status there. So looking from the first quarter we're actually down a little bit sequentially reflecting some normal seasonal trends. Yes, and Fadi, so in terms of the financial impact as we get into next year, the core trucking business has truck like margins. So you can expect to see that next year, but it's about the conversion that Kevin has been talking about, when we're able to drive some of that business that's moving over the road today over to the rail, and do it on existing trains, the incrementals on that growth should be pretty significant. We've got to ramp that up over time. We need to make sure we've got the equipment and all the piping in place, but you should see a ramp up in that next year. Yes, Ravi. So, that was impacted by the intermodal storage fees that, are due to the supply chain issues in the truck driver shortages that we've been talking about here. So, does that continue into the second half of the year? I think it depends on what happens with the persistence of those issues. But that's really the fundamental driver here in the second quarter. And then of course, you've got the quality impact that will hit other revenue in the second half. So don't forget about that as well."

I'm proud of what this team has been able to do under the environment we've been at, quite confident that in the environment we're in that Kevin and his team is providing us with some great numbers of what we need to look for going forward into the next six to eight months, as far as we can in this industry, but we know we can do better on these metrics and that's what I think is the great opportunity as an operating team as we look forward. We've got the rolling stock that we need. We've got the assets that are sitting there. It's people to Jim's point and I think it was mentioned by Amit it was 8% is what we look at for our attrition, which means we're going to be hiring for attrition, but we're going to be hiring for above attrition as well. We need to get 200 trainees out there, we mentioned that our T&E count is up a couple 100. You know there's more numbers. We know what our number is and we're going to go after that and for us it's all about the reliability to the customer. So as the fluidity picks up, as dwell continues to drop, yes we see some benefits there with costs and the rest of it as we move along, but ultimately, we look at our trip plan performance which is getting better and better, particularly on the intermodal side. On the carload side the reliability is where we need it to be. So we're going to take the steps required in order to get that reliability where it has to be and Kevin and his team are able to go out there and sell the product, which is service, and that's key for us. Without service we're not any different than anybody else, so we've got to continue to capture that which allows us to grow and continue to push forward. So maybe I'll let Sean really touch on the cost per employee. On the locomotive side, as we get faster, and we can improve our fluidity out there from even where we are now, we're going to need less locomotives. So the question isn't necessarily where our numbers at now. We are good with what we have for our locomotives. We still got hundreds of locomotives in storage. We've got a great rebuild program that we're continuing to do. We've got 60 rebuilt locomotives coming out here over the next three months, which will allow us to put down some more locomotives that aren't as fuel efficient. So we'll continue along that track and, nothing but continued opportunities, particularly on the technology side, as we continue to work with our zero-to-zero program through Trip Optimizer and Vitronics [ph]. There's a lot to gain as we continue to move forward on that front."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Q1 2021 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Bill Slater, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nBill Slater: Thank you and good afternoon, everyone. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Chief Financial Officer; and Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations. On slide two is our forward-looking disclosure, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. With that, it's my pleasure to introduce President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\nJim Foote: Great. Thanks so much Bill and welcome to everyone joining us on today's call. I want to begin by thanking all of CSX's railroaders for the hard work and the exceptional efforts they've made to keep the yards open and the terminals open to serve our customers throughout the severe weather we experienced this quarter, an amazing job. We entered this year cautiously optimistic about the potential for an improving economic environment, and I am pleased to see momentum steadily building over the last few months. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on laying the foundations to prepare for growth, and I'm excited about our prospects for the rest of the year. It's nice to finally have an economic tailwind at our backs. Let's begin with slide five of the presentation for an overview of our first quarter financial results. Earnings per share decreased 7% to $0.93, and the first quarter operating ratio increased to 60.9%, reflecting a spike in COVID cases early in the quarter, winter storm impacts, and fuel surcharge timing lag. Turning to slide six, revenue declined 1% on 1% volume growth as intermodal and other revenue growth was more than offset by merchandise, coal, and fuel surcharge revenue declines. Merchandise revenue declined 6% led by declines in automotive and energy-related shipments within the chemicals and minerals segments. These declines were partially offset by growth in the metals and fertilizers businesses. Intermodal revenue grew 11%, reaching new first quarter record levels. This growth was driven by strong demand for transportation services due to continued inventory replenishments and growth from East Coast ports. Coal revenue decreased 5%. Domestic coal revenue increased due to growth in utility coal shipments. This growth was more than offset by declines in export coal, primarily from reduced international shipments of thermal coal. Other revenue increased 42%. The largest driver of this increase was higher revenue from storage at intermodal facilities. Turning to slide seven, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. With fewer recent COVID cases across the network, we are able to increase the number of in-person interactions and training sessions. We resumed hosting safety summits across the network and are even expanding these summits to cover additional crafts beyond our T&E workforce. Our top concern is eliminating life-changing events, and through increased engagement on critical rules compliance, we\u2019ve seen a reduction in injury severity to start the year. Continued education and training will allow us to further reduce the total number of injuries by working with both managers and frontline employees on how to identify and eliminate unsafe behavior across the railroad. Additionally, we're finding new ways to improve safety through the increased use of technology. We are increasing drone usage to help ensure the safe movement of trains throughout our yards and are already seeing the benefits of this program in the positive train accident trends. We will look to expand these programs going forward as part of our ongoing efforts to identify and implement new tools to help us operate as safely as possible. On slide eight, let's review our operating performance for the quarter. Despite challenging conditions, the team did a good job of maintaining network fluidity throughout the quarter. Going forward, we are focused on driving velocity and dwell back to pre-pandemic records, and we expect to see improvement in both metrics throughout the year. We also remained focused on driving additional efficiencies across the network. We set a new record for distributed powertrains, averaging over 100 trains a day for the first time. Labor productivity also reached a new record. Even though we are adding headcount in the second quarter in preparation for the expected volume growth, we still plan to realize incremental labor productivity this year. Turning to slide nine. I wanted to take the opportunity to frame these recent operating metrics against where we started this transformation. Over this period, we have increased velocity more than 30% by reducing both line of road congestion and creating excess capacity within yards to limit how long fluid train sit idle. While dwell has also improved over this period, we view this metric as an area of opportunity. Even though CSX is currently -- has the lowest dwell in the industry, pushing this number back towards previous record levels will enable us to further reduce cars online and improve asset utilization. It is most important to note that this increased fluidity was enabled by redesigning the train plan to operate as a more balanced and efficient network. We are doing the same amount of work today with 1,500 fewer locomotives and dramatically improved locomotive utilization. These efforts have also driven significant improvements in fuel efficiency. Not only are we more fuel efficient, but we have retired older, less efficient locomotives and increased the use of distributed power and trip optimizer technologies to further expand the emission savings we offer our customers. Our train plant also greatly improves our crew productivity. One measure of this productivity is the total number of dead heads or the times we have -- or the times where we have to reposition crews using taxis or other vehicles because there isn't a return locomotive. The balanced plan reduced the number of dead heads almost 60% by better matching crews and locomotives in both directions. We have also increased the number of cars processed per hour worked by over 30%. This higher throughput is due to both a reduction in yard congestion, as well as, more strategic upstream blocking of cars. Anyway you look at the data, we have dramatically transformed how CSX operates, which has created the capacity to absorb significant growth for years to come. We remain focused on driving the network back to record performance levels as well as realizing the incremental efficiency benefits this will provide. Turning to Slide 10. I want to be clear that we are not done improving our network. The opportunities identified during the early stages of the pandemic last year continued to drive sustained efficiency improvements and the more streamlined network is well positioned for growth. While this quarter's trip plan performance was negatively impacted by the winter storms and COVID-related absences, intermodal trip plan performance will still improve -- was still improved for the quarter and is currently running nearly 90%. We expect to see similar improvement trends for the carload business going forward. We are committed to providing our customers with an industry-leading service product and are proactively adding headcount and prepositioning locomotives across the network to ensure, we are prepared to provide high-quality service while handling incremental volumes. I'll now let Kevin take us through the financials.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. The team is encouraged by the positive economic momentum. Underlying demand is growing, truckload capacity is tight and inventory levels are low. We are preparing the network for growth and focused on driving positive operating leverage. As Jim noted, we faced a challenging environment in the first quarter with winter storms and supply chain disruptions, creating headwinds both operationally and commercially. Looking at the first quarter income statement on Slide 11. Revenue was down 1%, despite a 1% increase in carloads. Double-digit gains in our intermodal business were offset by lower fuel recovery and declines across several merchandise markets. Other revenue was also up significantly, primarily reflecting increased intermodal storage fees. For the year, we expect other revenue of approximately $500 million. This assumes intermodal storage fees returned to more normalized levels. Total expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation as well as inflation and other costs. The year-over-year increase in incentive compensation was largely due to our annual bonus program accrual as we lap the impact of the pandemic. Our long-term incentive comp costs also increased year-over-year as our growth outlook has continued to improve. Sequentially, we expect incentive comp in the second quarter to remain relatively flat based on our current outlook. Partially offsetting these headwinds, efficiency gains remain strong as T&E employee productivity was up nearly 10% and train length increased 13% to a first quarter record. Total headcount was down 7%, reflecting structural improvements made over the last year. On a sequential basis, headcount was roughly flat, as increased T&E hiring was offset by improved labor productivity. Consolidation in our train plan has enabled a 23% reduction in locomotive maintenance headcount versus the prior year. We've also continued to drive efficiencies and yard support headcount, both through ongoing consolidation as well as technology. As you know, we are highly focused on ensuring we have adequate resources positioned to serve customer demand in a rebounding economy. We are actively recruiting and running important conductor training classes and as a result, headcount should increase slightly going forward. MS&O expense increased 2% or $15 million in the first quarter driven by a $15 million headwind from lower real estate gains, while efficiency gains were offset by inflation and other items. As we run a tighter trading plan, asset related efficiency gains continue to headline MS&O savings. Despite weather related headwinds and some proactive actions to pull assets out of storage in anticipation of higher demand, locomotive and terminal, productivity levels continue to achieve record highs. Real estate gains were minimal in the first quarter. However, as you likely saw last week, we announced the closing of an agreement with Virginia to sell certain interest in CSX-owned line segments. This project will generate meaningful value for CSX and enhance the safety and reliability of both passenger and freight rail service in the D.C. and Virginia area. The transaction will result in a significant gain of approximately $350 million in the second quarter this year. Cash proceeds of $525 million will be realized over time with approximately $400 million expected in 2021. Turning now to fuel expense, which was $2 million favorable year-over-year. Record first quarter efficiency helped offset the impact of a 4% increase in the per gallon price. We continue to invest in technologies that will deliver further improvement in fuel efficiency. Widening the advantage that rails hold over truck and demonstrating our continue commitment to sustainability. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $1 million in the quarter, due to a larger asset base, partially offset by the 2020 road and track depreciation study, reflecting these effects going forward, we expect full year depreciation expense to increase approximately $20 million. Equipment rent expense increased $7 million or 9% as network fluidity impacted car cycle times in the quarter. Turning below the line. Interest expense improved $3 million or 2% due to a lower weighted average coupon. Other income decreased $2 million or 9% as favorable pension impacts were offset by lower interest on cash. Income tax expense decreased $12 million, or 5%, due to lower pretax income. The average tax rate increased slightly to 24.7% due to an unfavorable state legislative change. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.1 billion and a 60.9% operating ratio. Turning to the cash flow slide on 13. On the first quarter, free cash flow before dividends was $934 million, up 15% when compared to the first quarter of 2020. Free cash flow conversion on net income exceeded 100%. Finally, as you can see from the chart on the right, shareholder distributions rebounded in the quarter. Share repurchase activity returned to prior year levels, and the recent dividend increase is also reflected. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in our buyback approach going forward, and we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJim Foote: Great, Kevin. Thanks a lot. Concluding with slide 15, we entered the year projecting volume growth in excess of GDP and still expect to achieve this target. We will continue to attract demand throughout the year and based on the combination of the strengthening economic outlook and our focus on converting additional volumes off the highway, we now expect to achieve double-digit full year revenue growth. We will drive incremental operating leverage by efficiently absorbing this growth, and we'll diligently monitor our train plan to address resources as needed to provide our customers with high-quality service. Our entire company is aligned to capture this growth opportunity. And as always, our focus is first and foremost on our customers and finding creative ways to help customers meet their own growth targets this year. Now, is the time to capitalize all the work we have done to transform our network. Thank you. And now I'll turn it back to Bill for questions. And as you may have noted, Mark is unable to join the call again today. He continues to deal with a non-COVID personal health issue, but remains engaged in the business. The rest of the team will do the best to answer any marketing questions you may have.\nBill Slater: Thank you, Jim. In the interest of time, I would ask everyone to please limit themselves to one question. With that, we will now take questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We have our first question coming from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Jim, can you talk about the pace of growth and the employee ramp-up as you need -- you talked about the hiring in advance? And maybe the pace of expenses we should expect as we see that ramp up versus the revenue recognition as we move through the second half -- in the second quarter?\nJim Foote: Great, Ken. Good question, and I'll ask Jamie or Kevin to add a little clarity as well. But generally, and you well know how long it takes for us to hire. So, we've been at this since the beginning of the year and have been running people through their classes, which we couldn't do before because of the social distancing issues. And so, we've been running people through the classes and now getting them out into the field, and they're starting to come out. And while we're reasonably well positioned, our numbers clearly have been impacted in the -- were impacted in the first quarter, because we were struggling in certain areas across the railroad because of crude challenges. These people are becoming -- are coming on now and will be coming on throughout the second quarter at regular intervals, as we, again, expect to see volume growth continue to increase now into the second and third quarter. Jamie, do you want to give some more detail?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. No, absolutely. Ken, we're -- what we're seeing right now is, every week, as it stands, about 10 or 12 employees on the network that are qualifying as conductors, but we've really bumped up our classes. As Jim has mentioned, just over the past couple of months, we're training anywhere from 60 to 90 new conductors depending on the month, every two weeks, there's a new course, making sure that we follow all the protocol with those required within this COVID environment. And really, we're positioning the employees in areas where we need them. We still have furloughed employees around the company that aren't willing to leave the locations where they're at. And in our industry, when we hire somebody, you hire them for a certain location. You offer transfers, moves, temporary or permanent, but it's up to the employee to make those decisions. So we will continue to hire, as we said last quarter, 400, 500 folks here throughout the year. But really, we're going to hit that, I would say, as we enter into the second half. And we'll continue to hire if we see the business levels come to the point that we think they will, and we'll just keep adding those resources. So we've got a great position that really puts us in that spot where we're looking at growth.\nKevin Boone: Hey, Ken, the only other thing I would add is, while we're going to add some employees that we saw over time at a quite high level in the first quarter, and we would expect that number to come down over time as a hiring, so largely offsetting some of the incremental costs there.\nKen Hoexter: So, offsetting some of the incremental cost per employee?\nKevin Boone: Yes.\nKen Hoexter: Or is that incentive comp? Okay.\nKevin Boone: That's right. You'll probably see the highest quarter in terms of cost per employee this quarter.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Appreciate the insight.\nJamie Boychuk: Some of that's definitely related towards winter weather, though, in this quarter. It was a very difficult quarter, as Jim had mentioned here with the polar vortex and the rest of it. So, you're going to see those numbers come down.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks for the insight guys. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Allison Landry with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAllison Landry: Thanks. I just wanted to ask about the service metrics. I mean obviously, you had the challenges of weather in Q1 and supply chains are quite clearly still in disarray. But Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, you're expecting to get back to pre-COVID levels and record levels. How long do you think it will be before you guys can start to see some second derivative improvement, at least in the velocity numbers and dwell? And do you think that with demand increasing and strengthening, that it's going to take a few quarters? Just help us think through that. Thank you.\nJim Foote: In the intermodal area, as I said, we are back to our best industry-leading performance, I think, in terms of intermodal, in terms of our velocity is already up, but again what we look at very closely is the trip plan compliance number, which takes everything into consideration. It doesn't do any good if you get to train across at a super high speed and then it sits at the terminal and can't get yard and you can't get the box off and the customer doesn't get it when he needs it. So, everything has to come together, and that's what's reflected in this trip plan number. And in intermodal, there's zero cushion. It's not like, yes, we met the trip plan, but give or take a couple of hours. In intermodal, it\u2019s zero time. So, we're back into the 90, 90-plus on-time performance in our trip plans in intermodal today, which is we were doing a little bit better than that a year ago in January, late the year before. And I expect that number to continue to creep up quickly in the second quarter if we catch a break and don't have some other kind of crazy weather events or something else. And then in the carload business, where -- again, our numbers are in this kind of mid-60% on-time -- the trip plan performance range, and that relates to about 30% a couple of years ago. And we want to get that number back into the mid-80% range where it was, and my challenge there is to Jamie is to get it done sooner than later. I'd like to see our velocity and dwell numbers get back to where they were kind of by the end of the second quarter, if possible. And then the trip plan numbers will start to come together as the year progresses. That puts the operating guys under a lot of pressure and -- but again, we're just getting back to where we are because once we're back to where we were, we're going to get better from there.\nAllison Landry: Thank you. That is helpful.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks and good afternoon. So I wanted to ask about the OR. In the first quarter, I think intra-quarter, you talked about 100 basis points worse kind of year-over-year with your expectation late in the quarter? Just curious what changed, if anything in March relative to the reported number? And then going forward, the revenue guidance is very helpful, but anything you'd be willing to share on incremental margin targets as we look out over the rest of the year?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. In terms of the quarter, late in the quarter, we probably experienced a little bit more fuel surcharge lag than we were expecting late in that quarter. Also, probably a little bit of after effects of the weather kind of creeped into the last couple of weeks of March as well. And then finally, as we saw the prospects for additional volume acceleration in the back half and even into the second quarter, Jamie was proactive in pulling out assets to get ready for that volume. So we saw probably a little bit extra cost there, which we thought was the right thing to do given everything we're seeing out there. So that's probably the difference between what Jim talked about at the conference and what we ultimately saw this quarter. A lot of moving parts this quarter, obviously, with the impacts of the winter storms and then the revenue. Quite frankly after January, we were looking at a very, very good quarter. And then obviously, February hit us hard, and March was digging ourselves out of it. In terms of incremental margins, look, as we've said last quarter and the previous quarters, as we get volume growth and revenue growth, we anticipate dropping that through at a positive incremental margins. So it will matter the pace of growth that we see. And if we continue to beat our expectations, I would expect OR to continue to beat our current estimates as well. So it's somewhat dependent on the strength of the revenue growth this year, which we obviously expect some strong performance. And if it continues to get better, you'll see the leverage in the model as well.\nJustin Long: Okay, great. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. Jim, I wanted to see if you could offer some thoughts on perhaps your first quarter earnings is compelling, but there was another topic earlier today, you probably noticed. What might be the impact to you guys from a Canadian railroad buying KSU? Is it -- does that matter much? I mean, I don't think you've interchanged a lot of traffic with KSU, but how would we think about that? And I don't know if you have any broader thoughts on whether that potentially could be a catalyst for a greater focus in the industry on bigger consolidation? Thank you.\nJim Foote: Well, we've certainly looked at -- thanks, Tom. We certainly had an opportunity now over the, my guess is the last month or whatever it's been to kind of have a understanding of the CP proposal. We've had a manner of hours to absorb the CN proposal. And other than what we've, kind of, filed with the regulator concern -- expressing our thoughts on the -- so far, just on the procedural aspects of the CP transaction. I'm going to have to reserve comment about what I think in particular to either one of those transactions, until I had a time to see what they put forth and see what we think the impacts of whatever they put forth to the regulator in terms of why they think their transaction is a good deal. You've known me for a long time, Tom, I've been around this industry forever now. It seems like and started out in the days when the industry was, some would say, collapsed, if not near bankruptcy facing the prospects of nationalization. And over that period of time, since deregulation, the industry has transformed itself back into a strong vibrant industry, and most of that would be associated or attributed to the consolidations that have happened and the efficiencies that have come from that and the dramatic reinvestment and service improvement that has come to the industry as a result of those consolidations, all of which were approved by regulators to make sure that they were in the public interest and good for the customers. So, I have a view of what I think is -- if it's good for the customer, if it improves the quality of service for the customer, and it's in the public interest, I'm clearly say, hey, let's take a look at it and figure out what it all means. But in all circumstances, the devil is in the details of any transaction. And so until I get an opportunity to review any proposals, but I just have to reserve comment on the transactions themselves.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. But it sounds like you think it can be a constructive thing for the industry just in terms of being open to consolidation.\nJim Foote: As I said, I think it's been a tremendous benefit to the shipping community, what's taken place to transform the North American rail network.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Okay. Thank you, Jim. I appreciate it.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Yes, thank you for taking my question. I guess, Jim, I want to stay on that subject. I mean, strategically, I guess we've heard a lot of negativity, though, about the next wave of 'Class I mergers' if there ever is to be on ex-KSU, but thinking more about potential transcontinental tie-ups. I mean we've heard a lot of the negative input from certain groups when other deals have been tried unsuccessfully. But I guess we haven't talked about a lot of the potential benefits. I mean do you view strategically as that is the path forward for the industry looking out 10 or 15 years.\nJim Foote: No, I can't speculate on what's going to happen 10 or 15 years. I'm trying to figure out what happened 10 or 15 hours ago. So, as I said, there's been -- I think that, in my opinion, it has been the transformation of the North American rail network into what it is today has been a positive for the shipping community. And I think that's the key thing that the regulators look at, and I'm sure the regulators are going to do another thorough review of this transaction and see what happens.\nBrandon Oglenski: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon guys. So, a couple of small ones for -- Kevin, can you just -- yields have been negative the last few quarters. How should we think about the direction of yields and pricing going forward? And then you guys have $3 billion of cash, another $400 million coming in and generating cash flow. Is there a potential for accelerated buyback or do you think this is the right pace going forward.\nKevin Boone: Yes. As I mentioned on the buyback specifically, we will definitely be opportunistic if there's opportunities to accelerate that. And you could expect, given the visibility going forward that we'll be much more aggressive in that area, given the opportunity. So we have some flexibility in that. Clearly, as I've said, $3 billion of cash is not something that we're looking in a long term to keep on the balance sheet, and we'll move away from that. Second part of that question was, again?\nScott Group: Just the pricing momentum and yields have been negative, when you think we get to positive, how should we think about that?\nKevin Boone: Yes. We're going to lap -- on the fuel surcharge, we'll lap that headwind this quarter. So we'll start -- we'll see that, kind of, tick away starting in the second quarter. We'll see some positive RPU growth, as you guys look at it, starting second quarter. Coal will be more favorable as we lap easier comps from last year, really across the group. I will say, we were looking at this yesterday, is pricing renewals are above our average price. So we are seeing some acceleration there, which is good and would be expected in a tight trucking environment. And we're really looking ahead to more inflation potentially. So those are discussions that we'll continue to have with the customer. But I would expect the pricing environment to improve.\nScott Group: Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe kind of sticking on the revenue opportunity for a moment. When you think about volume for this year, I guess, I'm trying to hoping maybe you can get a little bit more specific when you're thinking about -- I know you pegged the, sort of, GDP clause. But if you could give us maybe some parameters, after we've seen sort of the toughest comp quarter out of the way? Obviously, we've gotten through the weather. We know, so the run rate of opportunity is now. It sounds like maybe there's upside from a revenue standpoint coming from both volume and price, but I don't know if you can kind of break those two apart for us a little bit and give us a little bit of sense of what you really see for the volume opportunity for you guys for the full year.\nKevin Boone: Well, we gave a revenue number. I don't know if we're going to parse it down into specific volume. I think you can assume that both, when we move into the back half of the year, will be -- start to be positive and more positive, certainly, in the second half of the year when you think about RPUs, just based on some of the comps that we're lapping from prior year. So, clearly, second quarter volume will accelerate significantly, given the COVID impact. Third quarter, you're kind of lapping some COVID impact as well. In fourth quarter, we started to see some recovery, particularly in the intermodal business. So from a pace, I would expect, obviously, second quarter to be the highest growth quarter. Third quarter probably follows that and then in the fourth quarter, it's probably a little bit more up in the air. We'll see how much the economy continues to accelerate from here. But the easiest comp is the second quarter, second easiest is probably third quarter. And -- but we still expect second half growth to be pretty robust from where we see it today.\nChris Wetherbee: And just maybe one point of clarification, since the last time we spoke three months ago, sort of the incremental upside, do you feel like it's coming a little bit more from volume or price, or a little bit of both? I guess, that's kind of what I was getting at.\nKevin Boone: I mean, clearly, volume will be, just based on what we saw last year, will be the bigger component of our revenue growth for the year, this year.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, I wanted to follow up on the incremental margin question. I certainly, hope incremental margins will be positive as revenue turns positive -- revenue growth turns positive. But we're talking about -- you guys are talking about feeling better about volumes. You just said pricing is better than kind of typical renewals. So you've been pretty specific in the past in terms of giving specific OR targets? I think, I'm not asking you to do that, but if you just look at the way your cost structure has evolved, it would imply 60% to 70% incremental margins, just all else equal, just based on the variable and fixed nature of your costs and pricing is getting better. So unless, I'm missing something, like why shouldn't incremental margins be 60%, 70% or better than that in the context of revenue growth, volume growth and pricing growth?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean, first of all, as I was explaining before, I think the magnitude of the revenue growth is a factor here, right? The more revenue growth that we potentially project here, the better the incremental margins. That's just basic math on that side. So we are very positive on the outlook. Well, as the network improves, that will drop through. And I don't think anything has changed from what we saw in the first quarter, what we said for the full year in terms of our ability to convert revenue into margin -- into operating income. We're not going to probably get in the game of getting a point target because things are still fluid from a revenue perspective, another point or two in revenue growth above and beyond what we have expect today. We'll see more benefit to where we ultimately land on the OR, so..\nAmit Mehrotra: Right. And maybe a better way to ask that question then, Kevin, if I could. I think you're talking about just the fact that you have regular weight inflation that doesn't make incremental margins linear as revenues come on, if I'm interpreting your comments correctly? So, is it right way to think about regular weight inflation kind of 2%, 3% off of your current OpEx base? And as revenue grows in excess of that, that will do much more significantly drop to the bottom line? Just help us think through the philosophy around what you're seeing.\nKevin Boone: Yes, that's exactly right. There's fixed cost inflation that you have to offset every year, particularly on the labor side. And then we're probably seeing -- although inflation remains low on the material side, seeing some signs of that ticking up as well. So, once you offset all of the inflation with further growth, then you'll see a more meaningful impact of the next point of growth above and beyond that -- \nAmit Mehrotra: And is that $200 million to $300 million a year as kind of that threshold point? Or is it less or more than that?\nKevin Boone: We're looking at about 3% overall inflation across our cost structure.\nAmit Mehrotra: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. \nFadi Chamoun: Thank you. Jim, I just want to kind of circle back on the M&A topic a little bit. So I mean, we're kind of seeing the merits of kind of end-to-end mergers being outlined out there, like from a shipper's perspective, improving the capacity, improving the service, potentially improving the cost for the carrier as well. Why wouldn't that kind of scenario apply to East West merger? It feels like when it comes to TransCon mergers, there's always this idea that they're anti-competitive mergers. And I'm just trying to reconcile, why would that be the case, within the supply kind of the same logic, if we put aside all dwell\u2019s new rules and all that kind of debate aside? Wouldn't, technically speaking, these end-to-end merger provide the same kind of benefit that we would see in these other proposed transactions?\nJim Foote: Well, certainly, there's an ongoing dialogue right now about the merits of end-to-end transactions. And historically speaking, railroad consolidations that were viewed as end-to-end and didn't reduce competition, or did not reduce optionality to the shipping community were viewed as -- viewed favorably. And I don't know that there has been any change in philosophy on that point. So like I said, we'll all see how this begins to play out. We're in the early stages as everyone keeps being reminded of a long process, in some cases, maybe a month, and in some cases hours. So we'll see how it unfolds. But again, the overreaching, overriding principles, I think, are applicable today.\nFadi Chamoun: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey good evening. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to come back to truckload conversion. Jim, you mentioned your 90-plus-percent compliance with the intermodal trip plan with basically zero cushion. It sounds like that's pretty truck like service. If -- are you seeing a material impact of the service on conversions? If not, what's left to really get more shippers over the line? And then when we think about making this longer term conversions. How are you trying to make these stickier rather than someone looking for capacity in a tight market? How do you make these conversions really longer term and beneficial for both parties?\nJim Foote: Well, yes, in the intermodal business, yes, I mean we're setting records in terms of our volumes. And this is -- that's after a couple of years earlier of reengineering the intermodal network, and which positioned us to be a bigger participant in this transformation to the e-commerce business model that so many people are adopting. So because we fixed the railroad, because we improved the service and because we've done all these things, we're able to participate in this where I don't think we would have been able to do that so effectively in the past and it shows in our numbers. And I don't see that changing. If people want to move more boxes and buy more things online, we want to be more and more and more involved in that supply chain. And we'll continue to work in that area to the best that we can. The other area where we\u2019re constantly focusing on truck conversions is in the merchandise side of the business. And that's taking metals and plastics and steel and cardboard and you name it, that today, we move in a boxcar, and the same shipper and the same plant in many circumstances is load and truck out the other side of their production facility. And that just takes us more and more time of getting involved, working with the customer. And we continue to see -- we continue to win business in those areas. And again, that's because our service equivalent to what they're getting in a truck. And so we have to get back to where we were in terms of -- and that's reliability is trip plan compliance. We have to get back to where we were and then get even better. And the better we get in that area and the more focused we are and that will continue to grow that -- those conversion opportunities as well.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And just to clarify, has the sales cycle sped up on this? Are you finding shippers and customers more agreeable to have these conversations to the extent you can separate that from service improvements versus just being tied on capacity across the freight network in general?\nJim Foote: Conversations in those areas are, yes. We're becoming more and more relevant in the supply chain. We're becoming recognized as being more reliable. And a lot of other factors are aligning as well is bigger -- our bigger customers want to do more and more things to become more environmentally friendly, we can help them with the reduction in our carbon footprint, so ESG plays in our favor, fuel efficiency plays in our favor. All of this, our willingness to do things differently than the way we have done it in the past are -- we're showing good results.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: Jim, I understand your reluctance to comment on transactions that happen to be been filed for approval yet. But you did mention that you have commented publicly on the procedural issue at stake here with the SDB. And I thought it was notable that CSX was the only Class I rail that suggested the waiver of the 2001 rules does stand up for KSU or ask that it did. Can you give us a little more information or context on that and why you look at that differently than, say, your competitors?\nJim Foote: Well, maybe to one -- in one -- it started with the proposed CN/BN merger. And I just happen to be sitting in the room when it was put on hold and a moratorium was put in place and all these rules fell into place. So, I have some sort of knowledge about how and why those rules were changed. And at that point in time, the ruling body felt that the -- an acquisition of the KCS didn't merit some speculative array of new ideas before they would approve it. And the regulatory body has had 20-some-years to change the rules that they wanted to change the rules and they didn\u2019t. So along comes a transaction and I kind of view the law is the law. And that's what we said. We don't see any circumstances that would merit a change from what was decided back in the day for the reasons it was decided.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Jonathan Chappell. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Jamie, maybe a question for you. You guys have spoken pre-pandemic through the pandemic about having spare capacity to take more business as your performance continues to improve. Obviously, the people's a different story altogether. But Kevin also noted taking some locomotives out of storage. So, how do we think about new capacity coming online as you do see this economic ramp and the favorable volume backdrop? And what does that mean for costs? And I guess the part B to that is, how do you balance the super strength in intermodal today with your desire to expand with better mix and merchandise?\nJamie Boychuk: Look, on our capacity side out there in the network, I still feel confident that there's many sections of our network where we can continue to absorb 20%, 30% business. In some sections that as we work close with Mark and his team, where we are reaching out to customers and understanding where that flow is going to come from, which will require a few more train starts. We have -- and, of course, I'm basing this off of us just over, let's say, three quarters ago when we were looking in the midst of a pandemic, and we were winding things down and record low numbers with respect to all of our assets. That's what we're basing this off of when we start talking about what we're going to need to pull out. So, yes, we're getting ready with locomotives, still going to be less than where we were a year ago or two years ago, with where the volume was at, we'll still see record levels with respect to productivity out of our locomotives and our people. So it comes down to the mix of business that we're going to see. We're making sure that we're able to provide that service that brings the customers to us. So that's something that we're really working on. And when we think about assets of people, attrition was a higher rate that we -- than we really expected throughout the pandemic. Those people, I think, it's just like the trucking industry, those who decided they may have thought they were going to hold on and not retire for a while. Well, they retired, and they packed it in, and it was a little too much for them. So, yes, we're going to see some of these assets come back. They're not going to be at the same levels that we had seen before. So, I think, as Kevin had mentioned, we're still going to see some good returns on all of this business that continues to come back in. And, I'm sorry, the second part, I think you mentioned was on the intermodal side. It was -- what was that question?\nJonathan Chappell: It was just balancing the equipment as intermodal\u2019s been incredibly strong, but you obviously have this desire to kind of improve the mix through merchandise growth.\nJamie Boychuk: Yes. I mean, look, we -- where we can, we'll run intermodal with freight together and then in other areas where intermodal continues to grow. I still have room on the tail end of intermodal trains. Very few of my intermodal trains, as it stands, are sold out. We have cars and storage that we're able to pull out, and we continue to pull out as we see the need. Growth has been very strong, as Jim has mentioned. And our terminals are in fantastic shape. Scott Marsh and his team that take care of the intermodal side of the business, have done an incredible job turning the assets when they arrive. And we continue -- fully expect to continue to see that productivity get better as we move forward.\nJonathan Chapel: Great. Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey guys. Good afternoon Jim. I appreciate you taking the time to share with us your sort of perspective on the historical sort of industry approach to consolidation. I wanted to ask you a question in a slightly different way. As you think about this opportunity to drive highway conversions on the CSX property. How would you think that an end-to-end merger might accelerate your ability to drive further highway conversions, whether it's carload or intermodal? And how is the Board thinking right now about the pros and cons of pursuing some sort of consolidation to help accelerate the highway conversion plan?\nJim Foote: Well, yes, you can answer the question in a different way, but you're going to get the same answer. As I said to the extent that the rail networks work together and however you go about that in creating a better product for the customer. And then mergers eliminate the bottleneck in between that it speeds things up and makes the service product a lot better and more truck like. But that's not my job, that's my opinion. It's not my job to rule upon the merits of any transaction based upon the facts, and I'm sure the regulator will do a very thorough analysis and determine, again, as I said before, whether or not -- it's not anticompetitive and it's in the public interest.\nDavid Vernon: So -- but in your view, the industrial logic of that end-to-end merger would help you to drive highway conversions. That's kind of what I'm trying to get at?\nJim Foote: Yes. Normally, one person in -- one person who is managing the supply chain the conveyor belt is better than having a one conveyor belt and having somebody take it off the conveyor belt and put the box onto the next conveyor belt for somebody else to run it. Normally, that seamlessness results in a smoother supply chain. And again, like I said, that's my opinion. But then somebody else has to look at it and say, Dave think it's a good idea.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. You mentioned the slides increased visibility onto the positive economic momentum. I was wondering if you could perhaps pinpoint some thoughts around that. Is it still focus primarily on the intermodal recovery, you're actually anticipating and seeing or expect the industrial side to -- is that the biggest part of the higher visibility, the insight into the industrial versus intermodal? Thanks.\nJim Foote: Well, I think it's a number of factors. Again, in January, when we were trying to take a view out for the next 12 months, I said that it was difficult to predict. And that my crystal ball was a little fuzzy, trying to determine about at that point in time, COVID cases were out of control. At that point in time, there was just a speculation about what was going to happen with the chip shortages. And so then -- and a number of people were forecasting GDP growth of X, Y and Z. Was there going to be a stimulus package? Was there not going to be a stimulus package? Was there going to be an infrastructure bill? Was there not going to be an infrastructure bill? And then you added into my crystal ball effect that it turned into more of a snow globe in February. Well, some of that smoke has cleared and people have taken their -- most people have taken their forecasts for growth this year up. And we're starting to now see it, feel it, have conversations with real-life customers about what they think is going to happen for the second half of the year. So that's what I what I mean by having more clarity in terms of trying to me tell the management team here at CSX, how to plan forecast and how we're going to run the business for the rest of the year.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Jim, if I can just follow-up on the topic of highway conversions. I mean, when you look at the last three years, we've had two of the tightest truck markets in history. So this should be the time when you guys have more volumes that you can possibly handle on the intermodal side and yet kind of look over the last several years, kind of, intermodal volumes haven't really materially gone up. So I'm just trying to understand what's that hold up there? Is it just more resources and capacity on the rail side? And if that's the case, why don't you guys just put in billions of dollars into increasing capacity of the volumes are there? Or if not, does there need to be a material change in the service product to actually close that volume gap and drive material highway conversion to rail?\nJim Foote: Well, again, let's focus on the intermodal side of the business. In 2017, we took off -- we demarketed about 8% of the intermodal business. In 2018, we demarketed about another 8% of the intermodal business. We then went into an industrial recession in a global pandemic. And throughout all of that, we're now producing phenomenal record volume levels for CSX. So not sure what you missed. On the merchandise side of the business, we're doing a really good job there. As I said, we're starting to convert business from the highway, which involves really no financial investment. It involves an investment on our part to make a commitment to the customer that we're going to provide them with truck-like reliable service, which we're now doing. And we're converting this. So I'm very -- obviously, I'd like to turn around 50 years of decline in the railroad industry in a couple of weeks and spending a couple of billion dollars, but I don't think that's possible.\nRavi Shanker: Okay. Understood. And I'm sorry if I missed this in your prepared remarks, but what's the current kind of percentage of the workforce that's kind of impacted by the pandemic and kind of maybe kind of on leave right now pending either vaccination or kind of quarantine? I think in the past, you've said that in some locations up to 20% of your workforce was out of commission, kind of what's the updated number now?\nJim Foote: Well, 20% would have been kind of like on a terminal specific basis, really on the western side of the railroad where we had kind of a cluster. Clearly, we don't have 20% of our workforce off sick. I think the number of employees who have contracted the virus is so far -- is around 13%. I think that's the right number. Yes, around 3%. Clearly, we had a spike. We had a peak just like everybody sells in the US coming out of Christmas. They gradually declined. Kind of going into March, the numbers were really, really low. I was feeling really, really optimistic. Everybody here in Jacksonville got their shots. And now the cases are spiking back up just like they are every place else. So, we're watching it. But again, it's a much -- in total of the workforce, it's kind of around the national average. We're a good indicator of -- we're at or slightly below the average -- national average for infection rates, which I think is fantastic when you think that all of our employees are out there and have been out there since the very beginning of all of this, ended January 2020 working -- going to work every single day. And we have less than the national average of infection rate, that's phenomenal work by our employees of taking care of themselves and their coworkers.\nRavi Shanker: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much. I guess my question, Jim, is on the potential impact a kind of a surge here in demand conditions? I know railroads haven't always like surges, surges or a big decline study as kind of -- is a better situation to be in. But what's different now would you say and maybe Jamie chimes in here, but what's different about how your network, your organization is set up to be able to handle surges? And are we able -- can you do that without major sort of disruption and the customers feeling the effect of those surges as kind of we did when the weather was a little inclement there? Just curious in that direction.\nJim Foote: Well, I think that what's different, first of all, is a mindset, a common focus amongst all of the railroads in North America in terms of wanting to move our customers' products more efficiently, effectively and then adjusting your workforce, so that it thinks differently, is more nimble, it's responsive to customer needs and wants to grow the business. So, I think, we have changed to a large degree, one positive that comes out of adopting a different business model is a completely different mindset amongst your workforce. We've got a long ways to go there. But -- and we're not afraid to how do we make sure that we don't get ourselves in a situation where we can't handle peaks in shipping volume. We were talking about at the end of last year, four months ago about hiring, because we want to make sure we're in a position to run our -- move our customers' freight in June, July and August. Nobody -- no other railroad guy would even talk like that before. They would, oh, God, we're not going to hire. We've got to lay off people. Things are bad. We got to lay off more people. We got to cut the workforce. We've got to do -- we\u2019ve got a furlough. We've got to park locomotives. Well, then the business would have surged back, and you wouldn't have been able to handle it. So, I think, we do a better job now as an industry of trying to look out in the future to make sure that we're in a position to be able to handle the peaks and valleys. I mean, think about what we went through in the last year. Just take the auto business as an example. Forecasted car sales are going to be very, very strong. We're going into January. Three months later, I looked on the morning report about how much auto traffic we were moving in, it was zero. And then we thought, well, this will never start back up. This is going to be a very slow startup. How are we going to handle this? And the next thing we know, we get a call saying all the manufacturers are going back to restart their plants three shifts a day. We were able to move, respond and be able to serve that customer segment in a manner that had very, very little disruption. We all geared up into January of this year figuring, all right, it's going to be another great year. And then guess what? All the plants are shut down again, because they can't get a computer chip. So throughout the peaks and valleys, we've been able to move and be nimble and take care of that very, very important customer base for us. And it's no different than take one of our very, very important intermodal customers that ship in boxes for the peak season. Well, the peak season started about three months earlier than peak season and then never stopped. So we've been there. Our terminals have been open now 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, moving as much as we can, record volumes. And so, we think differently and we respond differently.\nWalter Spracklin: That\u2019s great. I appreciate it. Thanks.\nOperator: We have our next question coming from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Gentlemen, good afternoon. Wanted to talk a little bit about the intermodal side again, clearly, you're taking business off the highway and that seems to be working. Where do you think you stand competitively with your Eastern partner? Do you think you're taking market share there? And just in general, growing the intermodal business. You mentioned you have room on the back of the trains. Is there anything out there in the marketplace right now, limiting your ability to grow? Is it drivers for the drayage side? Is it actual physical boxes? Is there anything standing in your way of growing even more than you are now?\nJim Foote: Well, that's a very good question. In terms of what it is that CSX has controlled over, I would say very little. We have train capacity. We have a very good service product. Our terminals are fluid. We can handle more volume and we can do that. In terms of the environment in which we're trying to be able to do all these things, there's not an area that I can look at. It's not in disruption or is a mess, whether its steamships backed up at the ports, West Coast, East Coast, sideways and the Suez, whether there's driver shortages, whether there's chassis shortages, whether there's box shortages. The entire global supply chain is stressed that I think everybody in the industry in all of the railroad at all of our major channel partners are doing an amazing job of trying to keep up with things and meet the needs of the consuming public when you're seeing these big changes in buying and shipping habits.\nJason Seidl: And in terms of your market share on the rail side?\nJim Foote: I think, again, I think we're doing -- I think we're doing a really good job. I think that the industry on a whole is clearly up, and that's despite, as I said, all of the supply chain being really under a lot of pressure in some absolutely horrible weather conditions across the continent in the middle the middle of a pandemic.\nJamie Boychuk: Just one thing to add on that is, I think we're really proud of the team with respect to what Jim had mentioned. We stayed open 24/7 through the polar vortex and everything else that happened out there. We were one of the only rails that never shut any gates. We were there for our customers. We supplied the service that we said we would, and we expect to be able to do that as we continue to move forward.\nJason Seidl: Well that\u2019s we hear in the marketplace too. Appreciate your time guys.\nJim Foote: Hello?\nOperator: Our last question coming from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much and thanking for taking my question. Jim, it's been a long call, but you mentioned something about the steamship backup, so they're still going on in the delays. I just wanted to ask you, all these inefficiencies, is it getting better on the East Coast ports for you? And can your system handle when these backups start to clear up and those volumes come to highway? How much business do you think you could be doing maybe not right now because of some of these inefficiencies that you are referring to in Jason's question?\nJim Foote: Well, again, we're part we're part of a chain. We're a link in the chain. And it's easier to move. It's easier to move the chain when it's not kinked and there's no problems in it and everything is working smooth. So I think that all of us would be -- could move more. Listen, the port guys don't want to --they don\u2019t want to put boxes on the ground, because they don\u2019t have a chassis, because they don\u2019t have a truck to dray it, because they can't -- the railroads are backed up, because the railroads don't want to deal with somebody putting the box on the ground because of this. We all would like things to be smoother, and we would all benefit from this. And I think that right now, if you added up all the pluses and minuses, rail versus truck, I think the rail comes out on top. People want to -- people will talk -- people start talking about autonomous trucks and that's the solution and how do we do this and how do we run more and how do we become more energy efficient and how do we do -- I say put it on the rail. We'll just take 200 of those trucks, and we'll take it across country with a crew of two, and save you 75% in terms of your emissions and your fuel spend. So we're there. We're ready. We're growing, like I said, we're setting records. And hopefully, we can get in the position where we just continue to set record after record after record after record. But it all takes -- we got the capacity. We have the ability. We just got to keep getting in there and fighting every single day to get as much freight as we possibly can.\nJamie Boychuk: And when you take a look at the driver shortage that's out there, a lot of the driver shortage is coming on the long-haul truckers. A lot of those truckers that like the long haul and wanted to move across the country, less and less of those are available. And when you look at drayage, when we bring it into town and we have someone who can dray it across town and go to bed every single night and be with their families, that seems to be the trend of what the new truck driver is out there, which again gives rail that advantage.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. This concludes today's -- \nJim Foote: Thank you, everyone, for calling in today. I really appreciate your good questions and look forward to talking to you all soon. Thank you. Bye-bye.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jamie Boychuk",
            "content": "Yes. No, absolutely. Ken, we're -- what we're seeing right now is, every week, as it stands, about 10 or 12 employees on the network that are qualifying as conductors, but we've really bumped up our classes. As Jim has mentioned, just over the past couple of months, we're training anywhere from 60 to 90 new conductors depending on the month, every two weeks, there's a new course, making sure that we follow all the protocol with those required within this COVID environment. And really, we're positioning the employees in areas where we need them. We still have furloughed employees around the company that aren't willing to leave the locations where they're at. And in our industry, when we hire somebody, you hire them for a certain location. You offer transfers, moves, temporary or permanent, but it's up to the employee to make those decisions. So we will continue to hire, as we said last quarter, 400, 500 folks here throughout the year. But really, we're going to hit that, I would say, as we enter into the second half. And we'll continue to hire if we see the business levels come to the point that we think they will, and we'll just keep adding those resources. So we've got a great position that really puts us in that spot where we're looking at growth. Some of that's definitely related towards winter weather, though, in this quarter. It was a very difficult quarter, as Jim had mentioned here with the polar vortex and the rest of it. So, you're going to see those numbers come down. Yes. In terms of the quarter, late in the quarter, we probably experienced a little bit more fuel surcharge lag than we were expecting late in that quarter. Also, probably a little bit of after effects of the weather kind of creeped into the last couple of weeks of March as well. And then finally, as we saw the prospects for additional volume acceleration in the back half and even into the second quarter, Jamie was proactive in pulling out assets to get ready for that volume. So we saw probably a little bit extra cost there, which we thought was the right thing to do given everything we're seeing out there. So that's probably the difference between what Jim talked about at the conference and what we ultimately saw this quarter. A lot of moving parts this quarter, obviously, with the impacts of the winter storms and then the revenue. Quite frankly after January, we were looking at a very, very good quarter. And then obviously, February hit us hard, and March was digging ourselves out of it. In terms of incremental margins, look, as we've said last quarter and the previous quarters, as we get volume growth and revenue growth, we anticipate dropping that through at a positive incremental margins. So it will matter the pace of growth that we see. And if we continue to beat our expectations, I would expect OR to continue to beat our current estimates as well. So it's somewhat dependent on the strength of the revenue growth this year, which we obviously expect some strong performance. And if it continues to get better, you'll see the leverage in the model as well. Look, on our capacity side out there in the network, I still feel confident that there's many sections of our network where we can continue to absorb 20%, 30% business. In some sections that as we work close with Mark and his team, where we are reaching out to customers and understanding where that flow is going to come from, which will require a few more train starts. We have -- and, of course, I'm basing this off of us just over, let's say, three quarters ago when we were looking in the midst of a pandemic, and we were winding things down and record low numbers with respect to all of our assets.

So, yes, we're getting ready with locomotives, still going to be less than where we were a year ago or two years ago, with where the volume was at, we'll still see record levels with respect to productivity out of our locomotives and our people. So it comes down to the mix of business that we're going to see. We're making sure that we're able to provide that service that brings the customers to us. So that's something that we're really working on. And when we think about assets of people, attrition was a higher rate that we -- than we really expected throughout the pandemic.

Well, they retired, and they packed it in, and it was a little too much for them. So, yes, we're going to see some of these assets come back. They're not going to be at the same levels that we had seen before. So, I think, as Kevin had mentioned, we're still going to see some good returns on all of this business that continues to come back in. And, I'm sorry, the second part, I think you mentioned was on the intermodal side. It was -- what was that question? Yes. I mean, look, we -- where we can, we'll run intermodal with freight together and then in other areas where intermodal continues to grow. I still have room on the tail end of intermodal trains. Very few of my intermodal trains, as it stands, are sold out. We have cars and storage that we're able to pull out, and we continue to pull out as we see the need. Growth has been very strong, as Jim has mentioned. And our terminals are in fantastic shape. Scott Marsh and his team that take care of the intermodal side of the business, have done an incredible job turning the assets when they arrive.

I want to begin by thanking all of CSX's railroaders for the hard work and the exceptional efforts they've made to keep the yards open and the terminals open to serve our customers throughout the severe weather we experienced this quarter, an amazing job. We entered this year cautiously optimistic about the potential for an improving economic environment, and I am pleased to see momentum steadily building over the last few months. Throughout the quarter, we remained focused on laying the foundations to prepare for growth, and I'm excited about our prospects for the rest of the year. It's nice to finally have an economic tailwind at our backs. Let's begin with slide five of the presentation for an overview of our first quarter financial results. Earnings per share decreased 7% to $0.93, and the first quarter operating ratio increased to 60.9%, reflecting a spike in COVID cases early in the quarter, winter storm impacts, and fuel surcharge timing lag. Turning to slide six, revenue declined 1% on 1% volume growth as intermodal and other revenue growth was more than offset by merchandise, coal, and fuel surcharge revenue declines. Merchandise revenue declined 6% led by declines in automotive and energy-related shipments within the chemicals and minerals segments. These declines were partially offset by growth in the metals and fertilizers businesses. Intermodal revenue grew 11%, reaching new first quarter record levels. This growth was driven by strong demand for transportation services due to continued inventory replenishments and growth from East Coast ports. Coal revenue decreased 5%. Domestic coal revenue increased due to growth in utility coal shipments. This growth was more than offset by declines in export coal, primarily from reduced international shipments of thermal coal. Other revenue increased 42%. The largest driver of this increase was higher revenue from storage at intermodal facilities. Turning to slide seven, we remain committed to being the safest railroad. With fewer recent COVID cases across the network, we are able to increase the number of in-person interactions and training sessions. We resumed hosting safety summits across the network and are even expanding these summits to cover additional crafts beyond our T&E workforce. Our top concern is eliminating life-changing events, and through increased engagement on critical rules compliance, we've seen a reduction in injury severity to start the year. Continued education and training will allow us to further reduce the total number of injuries by working with both managers and frontline employees on how to identify and eliminate unsafe behavior across the railroad. Additionally, we're finding new ways to improve safety through the increased use of technology. We are increasing drone usage to help ensure the safe movement of trains throughout our yards and are already seeing the benefits of this program in the positive train accident trends. We will look to expand these programs going forward as part of our ongoing efforts to identify and implement new tools to help us operate as safely as possible. On slide eight, let's review our operating performance for the quarter. Despite challenging conditions, the team did a good job of maintaining network fluidity throughout the quarter. Going forward, we are focused on driving velocity and dwell back to pre-pandemic records, and we expect to see improvement in both metrics throughout the year. We also remained focused on driving additional efficiencies across the network. We set a new record for distributed powertrains, averaging over 100 trains a day for the first time. Labor productivity also reached a new record. Even though we are adding headcount in the second quarter in preparation for the expected volume growth, we still plan to realize incremental labor productivity this year. Turning to slide nine. I wanted to take the opportunity to frame these recent operating metrics against where we started this transformation. Over this period, we have increased velocity more than 30% by reducing both line of road congestion and creating excess capacity within yards to limit how long fluid train sit idle. While dwell has also improved over this period, we view this metric as an area of opportunity. Even though CSX is currently -- has the lowest dwell in the industry, pushing this number back towards previous record levels will enable us to further reduce cars online and improve asset utilization. It is most important to note that this increased fluidity was enabled by redesigning the train plan to operate as a more balanced and efficient network. We are doing the same amount of work today with 1,500 fewer locomotives and dramatically improved locomotive utilization. These efforts have also driven significant improvements in fuel efficiency. Not only are we more fuel efficient, but we have retired older, less efficient locomotives and increased the use of distributed power and trip optimizer technologies to further expand the emission savings we offer our customers. Our train plant also greatly improves our crew productivity. One measure of this productivity is the total number of dead heads or the times we have -- or the times where we have to reposition crews using taxis or other vehicles because there isn't a return locomotive. The balanced plan reduced the number of dead heads almost 60% by better matching crews and locomotives in both directions. We have also increased the number of cars processed per hour worked by over 30%. This higher throughput is due to both a reduction in yard congestion, as well as, more strategic upstream blocking of cars. Anyway you look at the data, we have dramatically transformed how CSX operates, which has created the capacity to absorb significant growth for years to come. We remain focused on driving the network back to record performance levels as well as realizing the incremental efficiency benefits this will provide. Turning to Slide 10. I want to be clear that we are not done improving our network. The opportunities identified during the early stages of the pandemic last year continued to drive sustained efficiency improvements and the more streamlined network is well positioned for growth. While this quarter's trip plan performance was negatively impacted by the winter storms and COVID-related absences, intermodal trip plan performance will still improve -- was still improved for the quarter and is currently running nearly 90%. We expect to see similar improvement trends for the carload business going forward. We are committed to providing our customers with an industry-leading service product and are proactively adding headcount and prepositioning locomotives across the network to ensure, we are prepared to provide high-quality service while handling incremental volumes. I'll now let Kevin take us through the financials. Great, Kevin. Thanks a lot. Concluding with slide 15, we entered the year projecting volume growth in excess of GDP and still expect to achieve this target. We will continue to attract demand throughout the year and based on the combination of the strengthening economic outlook and our focus on converting additional volumes off the highway, we now expect to achieve double-digit full year revenue growth. We will drive incremental operating leverage by efficiently absorbing this growth, and we'll diligently monitor our train plan to address resources as needed to provide our customers with high-quality service. Our entire company is aligned to capture this growth opportunity. And as always, our focus is first and foremost on our customers and finding creative ways to help customers meet their own growth targets this year. Now, is the time to capitalize all the work we have done to transform our network. Thank you. And now I'll turn it back to Bill for questions. And as you may have noted, Mark is unable to join the call again today. He continues to deal with a non-COVID personal health issue, but remains engaged in the business. The rest of the team will do the best to answer any marketing questions you may have. Great, Ken. Good question, and I'll ask Jamie or Kevin to add a little clarity as well. But generally, and you well know how long it takes for us to hire. So, we've been at this since the beginning of the year and have been running people through their classes, which we couldn't do before because of the social distancing issues. And so, we've been running people through the classes and now getting them out into the field, and they're starting to come out. And while we're reasonably well positioned, our numbers clearly have been impacted in the -- were impacted in the first quarter, because we were struggling in certain areas across the railroad because of crude challenges. These people are becoming -- are coming on now and will be coming on throughout the second quarter at regular intervals, as we, again, expect to see volume growth continue to increase now into the second and third quarter. Jamie, do you want to give some more detail? In the intermodal area, as I said, we are back to our best industry-leading performance, I think, in terms of intermodal, in terms of our velocity is already up, but again what we look at very closely is the trip plan compliance number, which takes everything into consideration. It doesn't do any good if you get to train across at a super high speed and then it sits at the terminal and can't get yard and you can't get the box off and the customer doesn't get it when he needs it. So, everything has to come together, and that's what's reflected in this trip plan number. And in intermodal, there's zero cushion. It's not like, yes, we met the trip plan, but give or take a couple of hours. In intermodal, it's zero time. So, we're back into the 90, 90-plus on-time performance in our trip plans in intermodal today, which is we were doing a little bit better than that a year ago in January, late the year before. And I expect that number to continue to creep up quickly in the second quarter if we catch a break and don't have some other kind of crazy weather events or something else. And then in the carload business, where -- again, our numbers are in this kind of mid-60% on-time -- the trip plan performance range, and that relates to about 30% a couple of years ago. And we want to get that number back into the mid-80% range where it was, and my challenge there is to Jamie is to get it done sooner than later. I'd like to see our velocity and dwell numbers get back to where they were kind of by the end of the second quarter, if possible. And then the trip plan numbers will start to come together as the year progresses. That puts the operating guys under a lot of pressure and -- but again, we're just getting back to where we are because once we're back to where we were, we're going to get better from there. Well, we've certainly looked at -- thanks, Tom. We certainly had an opportunity now over the, my guess is the last month or whatever it's been to kind of have a understanding of the CP proposal. We've had a manner of hours to absorb the CN proposal. And other than what we've, kind of, filed with the regulator concern -- expressing our thoughts on the -- so far, just on the procedural aspects of the CP transaction. I'm going to have to reserve comment about what I think in particular to either one of those transactions, until I had a time to see what they put forth and see what we think the impacts of whatever they put forth to the regulator in terms of why they think their transaction is a good deal. You've known me for a long time, Tom, I've been around this industry forever now. It seems like and started out in the days when the industry was, some would say, collapsed, if not near bankruptcy facing the prospects of nationalization. And over that period of time, since deregulation, the industry has transformed itself back into a strong vibrant industry, and most of that would be associated or attributed to the consolidations that have happened and the efficiencies that have come from that and the dramatic reinvestment and service improvement that has come to the industry as a result of those consolidations, all of which were approved by regulators to make sure that they were in the public interest and good for the customers. So, I have a view of what I think is -- if it's good for the customer, if it improves the quality of service for the customer, and it's in the public interest, I'm clearly say, hey, let's take a look at it and figure out what it all means. But in all circumstances, the devil is in the details of any transaction. And so until I get an opportunity to review any proposals, but I just have to reserve comment on the transactions themselves. As I said, I think it's been a tremendous benefit to the shipping community, what's taken place to transform the North American rail network. No, I can't speculate on what's going to happen 10 or 15 years. I'm trying to figure out what happened 10 or 15 hours ago. So, as I said, there's been -- I think that, in my opinion, it has been the transformation of the North American rail network into what it is today has been a positive for the shipping community. And I think that's the key thing that the regulators look at, and I'm sure the regulators are going to do another thorough review of this transaction and see what happens. Well, certainly, there's an ongoing dialogue right now about the merits of end-to-end transactions. And historically speaking, railroad consolidations that were viewed as end-to-end and didn't reduce competition, or did not reduce optionality to the shipping community were viewed as -- viewed favorably. And I don't know that there has been any change in philosophy on that point. So like I said, we'll all see how this begins to play out. We're in the early stages as everyone keeps being reminded of a long process, in some cases, maybe a month, and in some cases hours. So we'll see how it unfolds. But again, the overreaching, overriding principles, I think, are applicable today. Well, yes, in the intermodal business, yes, I mean we're setting records in terms of our volumes. And this is -- that's after a couple of years earlier of reengineering the intermodal network, and which positioned us to be a bigger participant in this transformation to the e-commerce business model that so many people are adopting. So because we fixed the railroad, because we improved the service and because we've done all these things, we're able to participate in this where I don't think we would have been able to do that so effectively in the past and it shows in our numbers. And I don't see that changing. If people want to move more boxes and buy more things online, we want to be more and more and more involved in that supply chain. And we'll continue to work in that area to the best that we can. The other area where we're constantly focusing on truck conversions is in the merchandise side of the business. And that's taking metals and plastics and steel and cardboard and you name it, that today, we move in a boxcar, and the same shipper and the same plant in many circumstances is load and truck out the other side of their production facility. And that just takes us more and more time of getting involved, working with the customer. And we continue to see -- we continue to win business in those areas. And again, that's because our service equivalent to what they're getting in a truck. And so we have to get back to where we were in terms of -- and that's reliability is trip plan compliance. We have to get back to where we were and then get even better. And the better we get in that area and the more focused we are and that will continue to grow that -- those conversion opportunities as well. Conversations in those areas are, yes. We're becoming more and more relevant in the supply chain. We're becoming recognized as being more reliable. And a lot of other factors are aligning as well is bigger -- our bigger customers want to do more and more things to become more environmentally friendly, we can help them with the reduction in our carbon footprint, so ESG plays in our favor, fuel efficiency plays in our favor. All of this, our willingness to do things differently than the way we have done it in the past are -- we're showing good results. Well, maybe to one -- in one -- it started with the proposed CN/BN merger. And I just happen to be sitting in the room when it was put on hold and a moratorium was put in place and all these rules fell into place. So, I have some sort of knowledge about how and why those rules were changed. And at that point in time, the ruling body felt that the -- an acquisition of the KCS didn't merit some speculative array of new ideas before they would approve it. And the regulatory body has had 20-some-years to change the rules that they wanted to change the rules and they didn't. So along comes a transaction and I kind of view the law is the law. And that's what we said. We don't see any circumstances that would merit a change from what was decided back in the day for the reasons it was decided. Well, yes, you can answer the question in a different way, but you're going to get the same answer. As I said to the extent that the rail networks work together and however you go about that in creating a better product for the customer. And then mergers eliminate the bottleneck in between that it speeds things up and makes the service product a lot better and more truck like. But that's not my job, that's my opinion. It's not my job to rule upon the merits of any transaction based upon the facts, and I'm sure the regulator will do a very thorough analysis and determine, again, as I said before, whether or not -- it's not anticompetitive and it's in the public interest. Yes. Normally, one person in -- one person who is managing the supply chain the conveyor belt is better than having a one conveyor belt and having somebody take it off the conveyor belt and put the box onto the next conveyor belt for somebody else to run it. Normally, that seamlessness results in a smoother supply chain. And again, like I said, that's my opinion. But then somebody else has to look at it and say, Dave think it's a good idea. Well, I think it's a number of factors. Again, in January, when we were trying to take a view out for the next 12 months, I said that it was difficult to predict. And that my crystal ball was a little fuzzy, trying to determine about at that point in time, COVID cases were out of control. At that point in time, there was just a speculation about what was going to happen with the chip shortages. And so then -- and a number of people were forecasting GDP growth of X, Y and Z. Was there going to be a stimulus package? Was there not going to be a stimulus package? Was there going to be an infrastructure bill? Was there not going to be an infrastructure bill? And then you added into my crystal ball effect that it turned into more of a snow globe in February. Well, some of that smoke has cleared and people have taken their -- most people have taken their forecasts for growth this year up. And we're starting to now see it, feel it, have conversations with real-life customers about what they think is going to happen for the second half of the year. So that's what I what I mean by having more clarity in terms of trying to me tell the management team here at CSX, how to plan forecast and how we're going to run the business for the rest of the year. Well, again, let's focus on the intermodal side of the business. In 2017, we took off -- we demarketed about 8% of the intermodal business. In 2018, we demarketed about another 8% of the intermodal business. We then went into an industrial recession in a global pandemic. And throughout all of that, we're now producing phenomenal record volume levels for CSX. So not sure what you missed. On the merchandise side of the business, we're doing a really good job there. As I said, we're starting to convert business from the highway, which involves really no financial investment. It involves an investment on our part to make a commitment to the customer that we're going to provide them with truck-like reliable service, which we're now doing. And we're converting this. So I'm very -- obviously, I'd like to turn around 50 years of decline in the railroad industry in a couple of weeks and spending a couple of billion dollars, but I don't think that's possible. Well, 20% would have been kind of like on a terminal specific basis, really on the western side of the railroad where we had kind of a cluster. Clearly, we don't have 20% of our workforce off sick. I think the number of employees who have contracted the virus is so far -- is around 13%. I think that's the right number. Yes, around 3%. Clearly, we had a spike. We had a peak just like everybody sells in the US coming out of Christmas. They gradually declined. Kind of going into March, the numbers were really, really low. I was feeling really, really optimistic. Everybody here in Jacksonville got their shots. And now the cases are spiking back up just like they are every place else. So, we're watching it. But again, it's a much -- in total of the workforce, it's kind of around the national average. We're a good indicator of -- we're at or slightly below the average -- national average for infection rates, which I think is fantastic when you think that all of our employees are out there and have been out there since the very beginning of all of this, ended January 2020 working -- going to work every single day. And we have less than the national average of infection rate, that's phenomenal work by our employees of taking care of themselves and their coworkers. Well, I think that what's different, first of all, is a mindset, a common focus amongst all of the railroads in North America in terms of wanting to move our customers' products more efficiently, effectively and then adjusting your workforce, so that it thinks differently, is more nimble, it's responsive to customer needs and wants to grow the business. So, I think, we have changed to a large degree, one positive that comes out of adopting a different business model is a completely different mindset amongst your workforce. We've got a long ways to go there. But -- and we're not afraid to how do we make sure that we don't get ourselves in a situation where we can't handle peaks in shipping volume. We were talking about at the end of last year, four months ago about hiring, because we want to make sure we're in a position to run our -- move our customers' freight in June, July and August. Nobody -- no other railroad guy would even talk like that before. They would, oh, God, we're not going to hire. We've got to lay off people. Things are bad. We got to lay off more people. We got to cut the workforce. We've got to do -- we've got a furlough. We've got to park locomotives. Well, then the business would have surged back, and you wouldn't have been able to handle it. So, I think, we do a better job now as an industry of trying to look out in the future to make sure that we're in a position to be able to handle the peaks and valleys. I mean, think about what we went through in the last year. Just take the auto business as an example. Forecasted car sales are going to be very, very strong. We're going into January. Three months later, I looked on the morning report about how much auto traffic we were moving in, it was zero. And then we thought, well, this will never start back up. This is going to be a very slow startup. How are we going to handle this? And the next thing we know, we get a call saying all the manufacturers are going back to restart their plants three shifts a day. We were able to move, respond and be able to serve that customer segment in a manner that had very, very little disruption. We all geared up into January of this year figuring, all right, it's going to be another great year. And then guess what? All the plants are shut down again, because they can't get a computer chip. So throughout the peaks and valleys, we've been able to move and be nimble and take care of that very, very important customer base for us. And it's no different than take one of our very, very important intermodal customers that ship in boxes for the peak season. Well, the peak season started about three months earlier than peak season and then never stopped. So we've been there. Our terminals have been open now 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, moving as much as we can, record volumes. And so, we think differently and we respond differently. Well, that's a very good question. In terms of what it is that CSX has controlled over, I would say very little. We have train capacity. We have a very good service product. Our terminals are fluid. We can handle more volume and we can do that. In terms of the environment in which we're trying to be able to do all these things, there's not an area that I can look at. It's not in disruption or is a mess, whether its steamships backed up at the ports, West Coast, East Coast, sideways and the Suez, whether there's driver shortages, whether there's chassis shortages, whether there's box shortages. The entire global supply chain is stressed that I think everybody in the industry in all of the railroad at all of our major channel partners are doing an amazing job of trying to keep up with things and meet the needs of the consuming public when you're seeing these big changes in buying and shipping habits. I think, again, I think we're doing -- I think we're doing a really good job. I think that the industry on a whole is clearly up, and that's despite, as I said, all of the supply chain being really under a lot of pressure in some absolutely horrible weather conditions across the continent in the middle the middle of a pandemic. Hello? Well, again, we're part we're part of a chain. We're a link in the chain. And it's easier to move. It's easier to move the chain when it's not kinked and there's no problems in it and everything is working smooth. So I think that all of us would be -- could move more. Listen, the port guys don't want to --they don't want to put boxes on the ground, because they don't have a chassis, because they don't have a truck to dray it, because they can't -- the railroads are backed up, because the railroads don't want to deal with somebody putting the box on the ground because of this. We all would like things to be smoother, and we would all benefit from this. And I think that right now, if you added up all the pluses and minuses, rail versus truck, I think the rail comes out on top. People want to -- people will talk -- people start talking about autonomous trucks and that's the solution and how do we do this and how do we run more and how do we become more energy efficient and how do we do -- I say put it on the rail. We'll just take 200 of those trucks, and we'll take it across country with a crew of two, and save you 75% in terms of your emissions and your fuel spend. So we're there. We're ready. We're growing, like I said, we're setting records. And hopefully, we can get in the position where we just continue to set record after record after record after record. But it all takes -- we got the capacity. We have the ability. We just got to keep getting in there and fighting every single day to get as much freight as we possibly can. Thank you, everyone, for calling in today. I really appreciate your good questions and look forward to talking to you all soon. Thank you. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. The team is encouraged by the positive economic momentum. Underlying demand is growing, truckload capacity is tight and inventory levels are low. We are preparing the network for growth and focused on driving positive operating leverage. As Jim noted, we faced a challenging environment in the first quarter with winter storms and supply chain disruptions, creating headwinds both operationally and commercially. Looking at the first quarter income statement on Slide 11. Revenue was down 1%, despite a 1% increase in carloads. Double-digit gains in our intermodal business were offset by lower fuel recovery and declines across several merchandise markets. Other revenue was also up significantly, primarily reflecting increased intermodal storage fees. For the year, we expect other revenue of approximately $500 million. This assumes intermodal storage fees returned to more normalized levels. Total expenses increased 2% in the quarter. Walking down the expense line items, labor and fringe was up 2%, driven by higher incentive compensation as well as inflation and other costs. The year-over-year increase in incentive compensation was largely due to our annual bonus program accrual as we lap the impact of the pandemic. Our long-term incentive comp costs also increased year-over-year as our growth outlook has continued to improve. Sequentially, we expect incentive comp in the second quarter to remain relatively flat based on our current outlook. Partially offsetting these headwinds, efficiency gains remain strong as T&E employee productivity was up nearly 10% and train length increased 13% to a first quarter record. Total headcount was down 7%, reflecting structural improvements made over the last year. On a sequential basis, headcount was roughly flat, as increased T&E hiring was offset by improved labor productivity. Consolidation in our train plan has enabled a 23% reduction in locomotive maintenance headcount versus the prior year. We've also continued to drive efficiencies and yard support headcount, both through ongoing consolidation as well as technology. As you know, we are highly focused on ensuring we have adequate resources positioned to serve customer demand in a rebounding economy. We are actively recruiting and running important conductor training classes and as a result, headcount should increase slightly going forward. MS&O expense increased 2% or $15 million in the first quarter driven by a $15 million headwind from lower real estate gains, while efficiency gains were offset by inflation and other items. As we run a tighter trading plan, asset related efficiency gains continue to headline MS&O savings. Despite weather related headwinds and some proactive actions to pull assets out of storage in anticipation of higher demand, locomotive and terminal, productivity levels continue to achieve record highs. Real estate gains were minimal in the first quarter. However, as you likely saw last week, we announced the closing of an agreement with Virginia to sell certain interest in CSX-owned line segments. This project will generate meaningful value for CSX and enhance the safety and reliability of both passenger and freight rail service in the D.C. and Virginia area. The transaction will result in a significant gain of approximately $350 million in the second quarter this year. Cash proceeds of $525 million will be realized over time with approximately $400 million expected in 2021. Turning now to fuel expense, which was $2 million favorable year-over-year. Record first quarter efficiency helped offset the impact of a 4% increase in the per gallon price. We continue to invest in technologies that will deliver further improvement in fuel efficiency. Widening the advantage that rails hold over truck and demonstrating our continue commitment to sustainability. Looking at other expenses, depreciation increased $1 million in the quarter, due to a larger asset base, partially offset by the 2020 road and track depreciation study, reflecting these effects going forward, we expect full year depreciation expense to increase approximately $20 million. Equipment rent expense increased $7 million or 9% as network fluidity impacted car cycle times in the quarter. Turning below the line. Interest expense improved $3 million or 2% due to a lower weighted average coupon. Other income decreased $2 million or 9% as favorable pension impacts were offset by lower interest on cash. Income tax expense decreased $12 million, or 5%, due to lower pretax income. The average tax rate increased slightly to 24.7% due to an unfavorable state legislative change. Closing out the income statement, CSX delivered operating income of $1.1 billion and a 60.9% operating ratio. Turning to the cash flow slide on 13. On the first quarter, free cash flow before dividends was $934 million, up 15% when compared to the first quarter of 2020. Free cash flow conversion on net income exceeded 100%. Finally, as you can see from the chart on the right, shareholder distributions rebounded in the quarter. Share repurchase activity returned to prior year levels, and the recent dividend increase is also reflected. We expect to continue to be opportunistic in our buyback approach going forward, and we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Hey, Ken, the only other thing I would add is, while we're going to add some employees that we saw over time at a quite high level in the first quarter, and we would expect that number to come down over time as a hiring, so largely offsetting some of the incremental costs there. Yes. That's right. You'll probably see the highest quarter in terms of cost per employee this quarter. Yes. As I mentioned on the buyback specifically, we will definitely be opportunistic if there's opportunities to accelerate that. And you could expect, given the visibility going forward that we'll be much more aggressive in that area, given the opportunity. So we have some flexibility in that. Clearly, as I've said, $3 billion of cash is not something that we're looking in a long term to keep on the balance sheet, and we'll move away from that. Second part of that question was, again? Yes. We're going to lap -- on the fuel surcharge, we'll lap that headwind this quarter. So we'll start -- we'll see that, kind of, tick away starting in the second quarter. We'll see some positive RPU growth, as you guys look at it, starting second quarter. Coal will be more favorable as we lap easier comps from last year, really across the group. I will say, we were looking at this yesterday, is pricing renewals are above our average price. So we are seeing some acceleration there, which is good and would be expected in a tight trucking environment. And we're really looking ahead to more inflation potentially. So those are discussions that we'll continue to have with the customer. But I would expect the pricing environment to improve. Well, we gave a revenue number. I don't know if we're going to parse it down into specific volume. I think you can assume that both, when we move into the back half of the year, will be -- start to be positive and more positive, certainly, in the second half of the year when you think about RPUs, just based on some of the comps that we're lapping from prior year. So, clearly, second quarter volume will accelerate significantly, given the COVID impact. Third quarter, you're kind of lapping some COVID impact as well. In fourth quarter, we started to see some recovery, particularly in the intermodal business. So from a pace, I would expect, obviously, second quarter to be the highest growth quarter. Third quarter probably follows that and then in the fourth quarter, it's probably a little bit more up in the air. We'll see how much the economy continues to accelerate from here. But the easiest comp is the second quarter, second easiest is probably third quarter. And -- but we still expect second half growth to be pretty robust from where we see it today. I mean, clearly, volume will be, just based on what we saw last year, will be the bigger component of our revenue growth for the year, this year. Yes. I mean, first of all, as I was explaining before, I think the magnitude of the revenue growth is a factor here, right? The more revenue growth that we potentially project here, the better the incremental margins. That's just basic math on that side. So we are very positive on the outlook. Well, as the network improves, that will drop through. And I don't think anything has changed from what we saw in the first quarter, what we said for the full year in terms of our ability to convert revenue into margin -- into operating income. We're not going to probably get in the game of getting a point target because things are still fluid from a revenue perspective, another point or two in revenue growth above and beyond what we have expect today. We'll see more benefit to where we ultimately land on the OR, so.. Yes, that's exactly right. There's fixed cost inflation that you have to offset every year, particularly on the labor side. And then we're probably seeing -- although inflation remains low on the material side, seeing some signs of that ticking up as well. So, once you offset all of the inflation with further growth, then you'll see a more meaningful impact of the next point of growth above and beyond that -- We're looking at about 3% overall inflation across our cost structure."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Before beginning, the Company would like to remind you that the forward-looking disclosures have been provided on slide 2, and non-GAAP disclosures are on slide 3. I would now like to turn the call over to CSX President and CEO, Joe Hinrichs. You may begin your call.\nJoe Hinrichs: Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call. I'm here with Kevin Boone, Jamie Boychuk, and Sean Pelkey, and we are excited to update you on our quarter results and share our initial views on the upcoming year. I first want to thank all our CSX employees for dedication as they work diligently on behalf of our customers through all the challenges and uncertainties that we faced in 2022. Because of their efforts, our network has continued to run safely and our financial performance has been very strong. We have accomplished a lot over the last four months since I joined the Company. This inventory my visits to our railroads out in the field, visit to our customers, our investors and our many partners in the government, we finalized agreements with our labor unions. We reached a positive solution for the Gulf Coast with our colleagues at Amtrak. And we started to make updates to the nuts and bolts policies on attendance and make a big difference for our employees' quality of life. I am particularly proud to report that our service metrics continue to show real improvement into the fourth quarter after starting a clear upward trend in the early fall. And we are very pleased this progress continued throughout this month. As we anticipated, our hiring successes have allowed us to deliver better customer service that will allow us to capture more business with more volume over time. Looking forward, we are focused on building on our momentum, leveraging our industry-leading operating model and growing this railroad. As we go through the details and answer your questions, I believe that you will get a great sense of the energy and optimism that we all share across the organization of the opportunities ahead for CSX. Now, let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year. CSX generated over $3.7 billion in revenue, up 9% from the previous year on 1.5 million carloads in the quarter. Revenues benefited from higher fuel surcharges, strong core pricing, and higher storage and other revenue. Operating income increased 7% year-over-year to $1.46 billion and our operating ratio was 60.9%. As we've reminded you before, our Quality Carriers trucking business adds roughly 250 basis points to our OR. Earnings per share increased 17% to $0.49. Quickly looking at the full year 2022, our revenues of nearly $15 billion were up almost 20% compared to 2021. Our full year operating income of $6 billion increased 8%. Excluding the gains from the 2021 real estate transaction with the Commonwealth of Virginia, our operating income grew in line with our guidance for double-digit growth. Operating ratio was 59.5% for 2022. Finally, earnings per share increased 16% in 2022 to $1.95. Now, let me turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Joe. Turning to slide 7. Merchandise revenue increased 7% in the quarter, as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 2% decline in volume. For the full year, merchandise revenue increased 9% on 1% lower volume. 2022 merchandise growth was driven by higher fuel surcharge combined with an increasing pricing environment as inflation accelerated through the year. Looking forward to 2023, we have significant network momentum as we began the year, and we expect to leverage industry-leading service into growth opportunities with our customers. This is reflected in our recent customer surveys where we have seen a significant improvement in overall customer satisfaction scores. We see opportunity for solid volume growth in merchandise for the year, led by continued strength in automotive, our growing export plastics business and share gains as customers respond to our improving service. This growth is likely to be partially offset by weaker housing-related and domestic chemical shipments as we start the year. On slide 8, you can see fourth quarter coal revenue increase 20% on 9% higher volume and a 9% increase in revenue per unit. Full year revenue increased 36% on 1% lower volume and a 38% increase in revenue per unit. In 2023, we expect export coal volumes to grow in both, met and the thermal markets. So, we do expect benchmark indexes to decline from the elevated averages of 2022. We're optimistic about the potential positive demand impact of China's reopening. While on the supply side, we have a new 4 million ton met coal mine coming online this year. We also anticipate volume opportunity as we lap 2022 issues, including reduced production at some CSX-served mines and capacity limitations at the Curtis Bay and Mobile export terminals. We expect domestic volumes to be low -- be driven by low thermal stockpiles that remain below historical averages. Healthy inventory levels will allow utilities to better respond to natural gas volatility and more readily dispatch capacity to reduce stress on the U.S. power grid. U.S. steel production, which drives domestic coal consumption to benefit from a recovery in the automotive industry as well as higher infrastructure demand. Now turning to slide 9. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue increased 4% as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% decline in volumes. For the full year, revenue increased 13% on flat volumes due to a 14% increase in revenue per unit. International intermodal markets continue to be negatively impacted by slowing activity, which looks likely to continue into the first half of 2023. Imports have declined and warehouses have seen elevated inventory levels. To help counter this, we are pursuing several initiatives to bring new solutions to our customers to help them reach new and existing markets. With our domestic intermodal business, we see opportunities even as the trucking market has softened. The team is focused on accelerating truck-to-rail conversions, and now with equipment constraints largely behind us, the team has more opportunity to pursue these initiatives. We are seeing existing customers and those that are new to intermodal adopt strategies to drive more of their transportation spend to rail. The team is doing a great job of identifying these opportunities and building the relationships to drive this growth. Finally, moving to slide 10. Let's discuss CSX's role in reducing our customers' emissions. As we pursue truck-to-rail conversions across the markets we serve, we are actively promoting rail's environmental advantages to our customers. We are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their own emissions. These are board level initiatives for our customers and the opportunity to choose rail over trucks provides real, measurable savings across the entire supply chain. In 2022, CSX customers avoided emitting 10 million tons of carbon dioxide by choosing to ship with CSX versus truck. We continue providing an emissions advantages for our customers, we need to keep innovating. We are not only piloting new technologies that should provide fuel savings like zero to zero, but we are exploring emerging technologies that can be implemented in the future and keep CSX at the forefront of delivering best-in-class efficiencies. Providing visibility to our customers is also a priority. I'm excited about the additional insights we will provide to customers to help them identify and convert incremental freight to rail by utilizing our updated carbon calculator platform that will launch in the first quarter. Lastly, we are proud of the recognition CSX has received for our sustainability efforts, with several of our awards listed on this slide. It is a priority for us to remain an industry leader in environmental stewardship, and we look forward to sharing more details on the several projects we have underway throughout the year. Now, let me turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations.\nJamie Boychuk: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Safety remains our top priority at CSX and has been the foundation for our service restoration. As shown on this slide, a personal injury frequency index was flat from the third quarter and unchanged for the full year. The FRA train accident rate increased from the third quarter but improved versus the prior year. Most importantly, for the second year in a row, we ended the year without a life-changing event. These results were delivered with onboarding over 2,000 new conductors during the year and underscores the safety culture that runs deep within our One CSX workforce. Now hires learned the importance of operating safely in the classroom, but the most impactful lessons occured day in and day out on locomotives and in terminals working with more experienced employees. These daily interactions are reflected in our recent safety performance and emphasize the commitment to our operating safely at CSX. I would like to recognize the over 6,200 employees within CSX's engineering department, which set a record for the lowest number of train accidents in the department history. This is a true accomplishment, given the nature of their ballast-level work. In the year ahead, we will continue to instill the safety culture within our new hires, maintain that culture in our experienced employees and focus on the training and discipline we need to reduce human factor incidents. Moving to the next slide. You can see the success that our entire team has had in driving meaningful service improvement with a clear trend emerging around the middle of the third quarter as staffing levels at many of our locations reached key thresholds. Even with the temporary hit from the weather towards the end of the year, average velocity was up 11% sequentially in the fourth quarter, dwell was down 13%, and trip plan compliance improved by several percentage points for both intermodal and carload. This progress has not stopped as we crossed into 2023 with our service metrics continuing to trend towards pre-pandemic high water levels of late 2019 and early 2020. Our team is focused on improving network fluidity and delivering a consistent, reliable service that will encourage our customers to shift business onto our network, and the data shows that we are well on our way. Now turning to hiring. A robust training pipeline in over 350 conductor promotions over the fourth quarter allow the team to achieve our long-stated goal of 7,000 active T&E employees. Getting our resources to this level has driven the service momentum Joe discussed a few minutes ago. We will continue to support improved service into 2023. Going forward, we expect to stabilize active T&E headcount with targeted hiring continuing for key locations and to offset attrition. I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Looking at fourth quarter financial results, revenue increased 9% and operating income increased 7% to $1.5 billion as top line gain outpaced several expense headwinds that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $6 million favorable compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $15 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9% as a result of favorable adjustments to deferred state taxes. Our expected tax rate going forward continues to be 24.5%. Fourth quarter net earnings increased 9% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 17%. Full year 2022 results were highlighted by top line growth of 19%. Operating income was up 8%, which includes a 4-point impact from the Virginia real estate transaction, resulting in 12% growth when adjusting for these gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expense. Total fourth quarter expense increased $210 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher fuel costs and inflation. Fuel expense was the most significant driver of $129 million due to higher prices. Labor and fringe expense increased $23 million as the impacts of additional headcount and wage inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation. PS&O increased $54 million, primarily due to higher operating support and terminal costs, which will remain somewhat elevated near term as operations continue to improve. PS&O inflation is also running around 5% and the quarter included about $10 million of expense from obsolete inventory and technology write-offs. Depreciation increased by $33 million in the quarter, which includes an ongoing quarterly impact of about $20 million related to the completion of a periodic equipment study. As a result of this study and a higher net asset base, full year depreciation expense will be up approximately $100 million in 2023. Equipment and rents was relatively flat versus the prior year and gains on property dispositions increased $31 million. While we are always looking for opportunities to leverage excess real estate, we'll likely have a few small gains. We aren't expecting any significant sales activity in 2023 at this point. Overall, congestion-related expenses were slightly above $30 million in the fourth quarter, and part of that cost was incurred during winter storms at the end of the period. Despite elevated inflation and increased headcount, we expect to deliver strong cost efficiency throughout 2023, as better fluidity reduces terminal costs, overtime pay and other expenses. Now turning to cash flow on slide 18. Full year free cash flow of $3.7 billion decreased $100 million but was approximately $100 million above prior year results adjusting for the Virginia transaction. Operating cash flow increased over $500 million on higher earnings, more than offsetting approximately $350 million of additional capital spend from our continued focus on both, investing for the long-term reliability of our network, as well as identifying and executing high-return strategic projects. After fully funding capital needs, we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders in 2022, including over $4.7 billion of share repurchases and $850 million in dividends. We exited the year with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, including $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we remain committed to a balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoe Hinrichs: Thank you, Sean. Before we discuss our outlook, I want to briefly touch on a couple of key ideas that we think about the ONE CSX concept and how it fits together with the fundamentals of scale railroading at the core of this company. This past year has seen a lot of commentary from many different parties about what scale railroading is and how it's supposed to work. For us, it really is quite simple operating philosophy based on the 5 principles that you see across the top of slide 20. The key, just as it is with the railroad network, is to keep everything in balance, optimize your assets and ensure you show respect for your employees; be disciplined in cost control; and maintain your client to good service. If you can't service your customers well and reliably, all the cost control in the world won't deliver a healthy growing business. CSX has been tremendously successful over the last several years as the company has undergone its transformation. In my view, we've done particularly well across the first three of these scale railroading principles. The opportunity for us now is to focus on getting to even better balance with those last two. We will redouble our efforts in serving our customers and ensuring that our employees, the people who are delivering that service to our customers, feel valued, appreciated and included. To address this and bring out the best of this operating model can deliver, we are building a One CSX culture that prioritizes our relationships and leverages our common goals. Whether you are an employee, a customer or a shareholder, you want a strong and thriving CSX. A healthy culture leverages that alignment to do better together. Under each heading, you will see a couple of the ways we have brought these principles to life over the last year. At the bottom, we give examples of what we aim to do. As an example, for customer service, we have added the T&E resources we have needed to increase capacity, and we have built resilient momentum as our service measures have improved. Now looking forward, it is critical that we ensure that our service metrics reflect our customer experience and that we are measuring and evaluating ourselves in the right way. We also know that we have to improve the way that we interface with our customers and make it easier to do business with us if we are going to win market share from trucks. Every week, we get together as a leadership team. We are challenging ourselves to find new ways to address these issues and take advantage of the great energy that we are creating here at CSX. We have tremendous talent here. And with these principles at our road map, we have a clear, collective goal. Now, let's conclude with a review of our outlook for '23 as shown on slide 21. First, as our service levels keep improving, we expect to achieve overall volume growth for the year, which will outpace real GDP growth, driven largely by strong contributions from merchandise and coal, as Kevin discussed. That said, we do believe that international intermodal volume is likely to be soft, particularly over the first half of the year, as imports have slowed and retailer inventory levels have recovered. Next, the pricing environment remains favorable for us. Our customers have experienced substantial inflation and understand that we face our own cost pressures, including the effects of the recent labor agreements. This transparency has helped us as we renew our pricing agreements, which will support our top line performance. That said, there are a couple of important things to note for 2023. First, we do expect revenues from intermodal storage to decline through the year as supply chain conditions improve. We currently believe it is reasonable to expect we will see a reduction of approximately $300 million in intermodal storage revenue compared to last year, which would imply a quarterly average close to levels seen in early 2021. Second, international met coal benchmarks have recovered from their lows of last fall, but remained volatile. High quality Australia met coal averaged roughly $355 in 2022 and sits at $315 today. It is likely at the average this year will be lower year-over-year, which will impact our coal RPU and our total revenue. Now regarding profitability, we will face cost better in 2023, but we know that we can get better operationally. Where it is possible and where it makes sense, we will make every effort to realize efficiency gains and reduce some of the extra costs that we have been carrying to demand through the congestion and resource constraints of that post-pandemic period. In the end, our margin performance will largely depend on our success in driving more volume through our network and realizing potential operating leverage. Finally, we estimate that our capital expenditures will increase to approximately $2.3 billion, driven by a full year of spending for PNM, additional equipment for quality carriers structure real conversion opportunities, investing in strategic high-return growth projects and the effects of inflation. Now, before we close, I want to emphasize what an exciting time it is for all of us to be a part of the ONE CSX team. We have a common goal to properly grow this railroad, and you are seeing the real progress that we are making toward that goal as we put people and resources into place. I am personally very optimistic about the opportunities ahead, and I look forward to updating you on the achievements throughout the year. Thank you. And with that, we will now take your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] With that, our first question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. I wanted to ask about yields kind of on a consolidated basis for this year. Obviously, the supplemental revenue and fuel will be somewhat of a headwind. I guess, standing here today, would it be fair to say kind of yield will be flattish on a net basis? And Sean, I guess, if revenue is kind of flat, can you just remind us of kind of the cost that are in the system that you think can be reversed to maybe offset some of the cost inflation? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Amit, this is Sean. Yes. So, in terms of the yields, I think Joe sort of laid out our expectation on the coal side, perhaps a little bit lower just looking at the comparison versus some of the record levels last year, fuel potentially a little bit of a headwind on a yield basis as well. We'll have a little bit of positive mix, at least in the first half here with the pressures on intermodal, specifically relative to the growth that we expect in merchandising coal. So, that's the yield story. And then, in terms of the costs, I think there's a number of different categories. Certainly, with the intermodal terminals becoming more fluid as some of that traffic moves its way out of the system and start spinning again. We should see some costs come down and the terminals are in very good shape right now. We should see reduction in freight car rents as our cycle times improve and they have already, things like overtime and ancillary costs related to the crews getting hung up last year with delays in service and then locomotive maintenance as we're able to spend the assets faster here. So, those are a few categories where I would say we ought to expect some improvement this year.\nAmit Mehrotra: Sean, any numbers around that, though? I mean, in terms of -- I know you've talked about $40 million a quarter, but any sort of quantification around some of those efficiencies -- inefficiencies?\nSean Pelkey: No specific number, no. I mean, we're going to have inflation headwinds, right? I think, probably in the 4% to 5% range. And our goal is going to be to offset as much of that as we can, both through taking out some of those extra costs that we carried last year as well as continuing to find efficiency gains across the business.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: There are a lot of moving pieces this year in the outlook. So, I was just curious if you could give us any directional color on the year-over-year change you're anticipating for both revenue and operating income? And maybe you could comment on what that trend line could look like throughout the year, if things are going to get better or worse? Would just love some additional thoughts.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. Justin, we're not going to get specific in terms of the guidance itself. When you look at first half, second half, the volume comps on coal are a little bit tougher in the second half than in the first half. In terms of intermodal, Kevin talked a little bit about some of the headwinds we're seeing on the international side here in the first half of the year. Those are really sort of the big drivers on the volume side. And then, in terms of all the revenue, that coming down about $300 million for the year, obviously, second half of 2022 was higher than first half of 2022. So we'll be facing sort of a bigger headwind there. And in terms of overall operating income, I think we've laid out some of the factors, right? I think we feel great about our ability to recapture some of the share that we missed in 2022, given where the service product is, given that we've got the headcount that we need and we've got the assets that we need, which is why we're going to grow above GDP. We're going to see gains in merchandise and in coal. We've got a strong price environment. We've got the cost opportunities that I've talked about. And on the flip side of that, we have a few headwinds between the supplemental revenue, the other revenue piece, higher depreciation and probably lower real estate gains. So, those are the factors. But that being said, I think the fact that we are expecting growth. And as we add that growth to the system, we're going to add that strong incremental margins.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: So, I guess, maybe piggybacking off that answer there, Joe. And I know you've only been there a couple of quarters now, but we've heard for a year plus that the real limitation here was headcount, resources and more importantly, service levels that you're delivering. I mean we're seeing that come through the data, I think, pretty strongly in the fourth quarter and as we start out here in January. So, can you talk to how you're going to convert that. And Kevin and Jamie, maybe how closely are your teams working together to ensure that you're growing in the right places? Because I think in the past, we've seen growth that can come in the wrong places and lead to even more op challenges for the other carriers.\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Thanks, Brandon. I think -- this is Joe. First off, thanks for recognizing the pretty significant service improvements and operating performance that we're seeing continuing into January. Our team works great together. So for what it's worth, and clearly, Jamie and Kevin, their offices are next to each other, and they're talking all day long. I'll let them talk more about that. But you referenced the fact that there's been some conversation for quite some time that our challenges were manpower levels and then how that affected the fluidity of the network, we're seeing, as you just referenced, the performance that comes from game of manpower levels where we want them to be and running this network the way it was run prior to the pandemic, which is a very strong operating team. So, the conversion opportunity is to demonstrate some repeatability and predictability around our performance and to show our customers that we now only have -- we have the capacity in place and we have the performance to demonstrate that you should come back to us. And I'm feeling optimistic about that. And the conversations we're having with customers, they're recognizing the improvements that we've shown for the last several months. And they're also confident in our ability to continue that, especially now that we have the manpower levels where we want them to be. So, if you look at it, we're still not meeting all the demand that\u2019s out there for carloads at our business -- for our business. And as we go through the year, we'll look for every opportunity to do that. I'll let Kevin talk more about some of the opportunities in the markets themselves. And then I'll let Jamie talk about the operations. Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Yes. Brandon, you did mention obviously, the remarkable improvement in our service that we've seen, and it's a real change, and there's a lot of excitement around this organization about it and what we can do going forward. Joe has brought both, Jamie and I and his teams together to talk about some of the key markets. And there's been a lot of interesting ideas that have come out of that where we can really leverage what we can do service-wise and what we can do creatively to create those opportunities for us. And those things are the fun part of what we do every day, and we're doing a lot less of that and a lot less of customer service and a lot more coming up with new ideas and having those discussions with our customers about growing. I'll tell you, I've had a chance to meet with a lot of customers over the last month or two. And every time, probably 90% of those conversations, we walk out with a lot more opportunities to pursue. Sometimes it means that we have to think differently. We have to introduce customers to what the intermodal product is or what we're capable of. And what we're capable of today is much different, obviously, than what we were capable of a year ago. And so, the team is getting together the whole sales and marketing organization. Jamie is going to spend time with them. I was going to spend time with them next week and it's off to the races. It's up to us to find those opportunities and really pursue them. But I'll hand it over to Jamie to talk about the upside.\nJamie Boychuk: I think really, the only thing I can add to that is there's a lot of capacity out there. So what Kevin and I talk about is where is that capacity, what can we do with that capacity, and how do we get out there and sell it. My team is out in the field, ensuring that they are talking with customers more than they ever have because they have time to do that. Previously, we were trying to find a crew to run a train here or there or wherever else. Now they have the time to sit back and deal with any of those customer demands that might be out there that helps Kevin and his team grow. Some of those discussions we have are what does the customer really looking for? Is it the right metrics that we're looking at that the customers are looking for and that first mile, last mile improvement that the team has been able to put together is really record-breaking for us. If I look back at the last 6 years, we haven't -- '22, unfortunately, wasn't the best year for us, but exiting '22 with our customer service and in '23 are some of the world record numbers we just haven't seen. So, our job is to keep producing those numbers and making sure Kevin and the team has what they need to get out there and sell and commit to the customers that -- what you see out there is what you're going to continue to see. So some great collaboration between our two groups.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChris Wetherbee: So I guess, thinking about the outlook and the optimism around growing merchandise and coal and good incremental margins with that coming on sort of compared, contrasted against some of these what are perceived to be very high-margin sort of revenue headwinds that you have, whether it be the accessorials coming down $300 million or the coal -- export coal yields coming down. When you think about those two relative to each other and the potential for cost out, I guess, any help in terms of how to think about operating ratio or the outcome of that whether it be maybe first half versus second half or across the whole year would be helpful. Just I think that perception of high margin on those headwind pieces is something that we're struggling with a little bit.\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Chris. So, on the -- obviously, the coal yields, there's no cost associated with that on the accessorials. There are costs associated with congestion in the terminals as well as needing to rent out space at container yards to move those containers around. So, that's part of the, call it, $150 million or so of additional costs that we carried over the course of this year. So, some of that will adjust down. And then, as we grow the business, our confidence is in the fact that we can grow it at very strong incrementals. And so, you put those together, and I think the question around what happens to the OR really depends on how much growth can we convert. We talked last year about the fact that there was demand out there that we weren't able to meet because we didn't have the crews that we needed in the right places. We've got those crews now. So, there's a real opportunity in front of us.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So, maybe I'll try it this way. How much volume growth do you think you need to be able to grow earnings this year? And then, it sounds like there's going to be some OR pressure this year. You've got some headwinds. I think that's understood. I guess, Joe, I guess, I want to understand, what's your commitment to longer-term OR improvement kind of beyond 2023, just thinking out the next several years.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. Scott, on your question about how much growth, I don't think we're in a position to answer that one right now that you kind of run it through the model, but I think we've given you enough of the factors. And I think the fact that we sort of pointed to coal and merchandise as areas where we think we can sort of meaningfully outperform whatever the economic indicators that are out there is a reflection of the fact that we feel good about where we are from a capacity and service standpoint and the ability to sell into that market. But, we're not going to give you a specific number there.\nJoe Hinrichs: This is Joe. On the OR question, Scott, I think there's a couple of points here. I'm very confident that our team will continue to deliver on the denominator side, operating improvements and continue to show strong operating results. On the numerator side of the equation, you're right in the sense that there have been -- there were some things that were strong tailwinds last year, the fuel surcharge, intermodal storage, the coal price, et cetera, and we'll see how much of that repeats in 2023. But that certainly helped the numerator side of OR last year and maybe some of those things won't be quite as strong in 2023. But having said that, on the numerator side, the volume growth opportunity that we can now go after with the confidence that we have in our operating model and our performance and knowing that for our customers who are feeling cost pressures and feeling inflation pressures and potentially even feeling effects of a slowing economy are going to be looking for cost reduction opportunities. And so, we feel very, very strongly that this year and beyond, continue to demonstrate the capacity that we have in our performance, the growth opportunity will be there for us as we earn the right to do that and get that business. And our customers will be wanting to do more business with us. In addition, of course, we have the environmental advantage of ESGs and emissions when it comes to rail. So, all that being said is we're not going to put a target out there for OR. We're very proud of our performance. I mean, last year, with Quality Carriers, we still had an operating ratio for the year under 60, so we know what it's like to -- and that was not at our optimum performance level as we all admit. So, we believe there is a strong performance inside of this company that will continue to be delivered. The uncertainty is around some of those revenue pieces in this year and beyond. So, our challenge is to deliver real growth in the business, which does deliver strong incremental margins and continue to control our costs, utilize our assets well. And so, that should lead to very strong performance within an operating band of OR that we'll be comfortable with. At the end of the day, this company is very focused on delivering margins, delivering growth with -- profitable growth with margin improvement, which should lead over time to a good OR.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJon Chappell: Kevin, as we watch these service metrics improved significantly since really the middle part of last year, and is intermodal trip plan performance just consistently around 90 and industry best standards. It's a little confusing that even given the headwinds, maybe your intermodal volumes are running lighter on a year-over-year basis than most of the other Class 1s. Can you help us explain any disconnect between those improving metrics and some of those intermodal shortfalls that may be unique to you? And maybe that also ties in then to explaining a bit more on some of the strategic opportunities that you noted in your prepared remarks?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think when you look at -- and look, three years -- or three weeks doesn't make a year, so we've got a lot of work to do as a team. But we -- I think you'll see over the last two years and through the pandemic that we really outperformed the industry and a lot of that growth that we mentioned before came on the international side. And we don't pay -- we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the other Class 1 railroads, but I do believe we probably have a little bit higher percentage of our businesses, obviously, exposed to that international market where we've had a great, great success, and we see a long-term outlook that's very positive for us. So, I think that's probably contributing to some of the things we're seeing here recently. But we've obviously had great performance and continue to think we'll win share in the market. The team has got a number of initiatives that will take form later on in the year and that will drive incremental business to the railroad. So excited of what we can do in the quarters ahead.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nTom Wadewitz: I just had a clarification for you first, before the question. I don't know if I caught what your GDP assumption is or which forecast you're referring to just in terms of how we anchor to the volume comment? And then, Joe, I wanted to see if you could offer some more thoughts about your comments on relationships? And I think tying into labor, how do you think about how you want that relationship to change? Does that cost you something to do that? And what's the benefit over time? Is it just probably attrition is running 15% a year, we wanted to get down to 5%, and that saves us sort of help service. Just some broader thoughts on when you talk about relationships and labor, what do you mean by that? And how do you think about what that does over time?\nSean Pelkey: Tom, on your GDP question, roughly 0.5% growth is the GDP number that we're looking at. And so our guidance is to grow in total above that with intermodal headwinds and solid growth across the other markets?\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Tom, this is Joe. Thanks for the question regarding labor. So lots of thoughts here, but I'll try to be concise. First, just a reminder to everybody that this is a service business. And we provide our service to our customers. We move their goods from point A to point B, and we're proud of the way we do that. But remember that in the service industry and service business, it's all about the employees. You're not selling a product, you're not developing a product. You're really relying on your employees to represent your company in the service of your customers. I start there because that's so critically important to understand why it's so critical to have a really strong relationship with your employees, including those represented by unions because they are the individuals doing the work, providing -- moving goods to make Point A to Point B and serving our customers. And so, the motive here isn't to try and leverage relationships to try and decrease costs or find a dollar here and there. It's all about building a culture where our employees feel valued and appreciated, included in the service of our customers in a way that we can demonstrate that CSX is unique and different from the other options they have, and provides a value proposition to our customers that we think can be very, very special. And so, there's a lot of -- I've been spending a lot of time out in the field, Jamie and I travel almost every week. And as I've learned a lot about this industry, about this business, there's a lot of variability and a lot of independence when it comes to the work that's done now in the field, because this is not a factory assembly line where you're stationed in a certain position and you've got a cycle time to meet, and if you don't make it, all bells and whistles go off. When you have your employees motivated, engaged and feeling valued, their efforts to support what your initiatives are, are greatly enhanced. And that's just human nature, and that's really what's important about this relationship is that listening to our employees, resolving their issues, working on things that improve their efficiency and their work life balance and their work life experience and safety and other things, leads to a better service product for our customers, which ultimately leads to a better business for everyone, including our employees. From the labor side, it's really about building relationships and generating trust and getting to the point where you're going to have real dialogue around solutions and around ideas and around understanding each other's desires and perspective so that we can find the best solutions. I have found in my past experiences that when you get to that point, you have a healthier business and you have happier, safer employees who are working better together to serve the customers. That's really the desire here is to provide that kind of opportunity for our employees. Now, what comes with that? Lower attrition, better recommendations for the referrals, for new hires and in the family and fund network, and just a better experience for everybody. So that's really a big part of the ONE CSX culture initiative is all around building this team, working all together and labor is a big part of that. And so, it's a little more complicated in the rail industry with 12 different unions. However, we feel really good about where we are with our team, Jamie and his team are working every day, having lots of good discussions. We voluntarily on our own, changed our attendance policy based on feedback. That's really impactful to our employees. That's a great first step in this relationship. We're listening to them every day. We're working on problem solving, and ultimately, with the purpose in mind of creating that environment where employees want to be a part of that and want to serve our customers better. And with that comes a much more efficient operation and, frankly, better service for our customers, which ultimately leads to opportunity for growth.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Good afternoon. And thanks for the rundown there, Joe. Just maybe can we clarify? Sean, I guess you're looking for volume growth offset by accessorial and cold yield declines, efficiency gains with service costs gone, but inflation up. But I just want to clarify, you're not specifically committing to income or operating improvement for the year, right? There was no outlook on what that means for collateral or the EPS line?\nSean Pelkey: That's right.\nKen Hoexter: And then Jamie, the on-time originations fell to 54%. I think they've fallen now 12 of the past 13 quarters. Isn't the whole name of the game of what you're doing with precision railroading to leave on time and get that moving? Maybe talk to me about what the network needs to do to fix that? And Joe, I don't know if you've come in what your thoughts are on operations, what balance of operations versus top line growth.\nJamie Boychuk: Okay. And you're right. The last couple of years, really, we've seen our on-time originations drop. And that's been -- it's been consistent, unfortunately, because of the manpower situation we've been in. I'm happy to say, over the past three weeks into this year, we started to get back up to our record highs. The team is hitting up over 85% on-time, which is great. It starts to get us balanced. And as we continue to onboard some more folks, we'll continue to get that driven up to that record of, I think, in 2019, where we're up around 89%, 90% on-time origination. And that's what we're shooting for. So, it is important. It's an important metric we'll watch. We made some decisions last year to back off a little bit on that, so we could connect as much traffic as we could and not leave things behind when we did have a crew and make sure we took advantage of that crew, and we maximized what we could on those train starts. Not saying that we're letting that go at all. We're going to maximize what's on each one of these trains that we run out there car-wise, but we've now got the people to balance the assets across the network, and you can see it. If you take a look at our velocity, and you take a look at our dwell numbers just in the past 3, 4 weeks, you can see that the network is running much more fluid. We hit that magic number just into the new year that we're looking for that 7,000 T&E count. And actually, as a matter of fact, we're at 7,100 today. And we're going to push that number a little bit more to cover vacation coming up in the next few months. So, we're going to make sure that we've got the right headcount. We're going to make sure that we've got the right people in the right places, and we continue to drive those metrics that will drive the rest of the service metrics. I mean, again, TPC, whether it's carload, intermodal, all the rest of it that you see that we've put out there, we're starting to get back to our -- as a matter of fact, we're beyond our record numbers on some of those service metrics. So, we're going to provide a product that Kevin and his team can go out there and sell and start growing this company.\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. So Ken, thanks for the question. A couple of just additional comments. We spend a lot of time as a team talking about our customer service metrics, whether it's on-time, originations and arrivals, whether it's in the last mile, first mile, those kind of things. And I'm really pleased with how the team is looking at everything. And we want to make sure that we're seeing the world through the lens -- through the eyes of our customers, which is why we get feedback on surveys. And Kevin referenced, we've seen the best results in our customer surveys that we've seen in quite some time. So, I feel really good about that. Now, the balance between top line growth and operations, I think they're intertwined. And I said this in October. I feel even more strongly about it now. We have a phenomenal opportunity here at CSX to leverage our strength in our operational performance that you've seen pre-pandemic. You're seeing now again to earn the right to talk to our customers about getting more business. And that is a lot better than chasing top line growth, and to be able to demonstrate that you can rely on us with our capacity and our service levels and our prioritization on your service to be there for you. And I believe very strongly, there's business opportunity there. So, we can allow that to happen naturally organically because we have a better product. We have a lower price than most trucking. And we have a better ESG solution and to do that the right way. So that's why we've been so focused on getting the manpower where it needs to be and really getting -- making sure that we're focusing on the right metrics for the business, and I'm really pleased with where we are. So, I feel even more strongly today than I did in the call in October about this opportunity. We can't predict what's going to happen in the economy this year, and that's part of what you're seeing in some of this dialogue is we're not exactly sure what happens in the second and third quarter. We're very pleased with how the year has started. However, we don't know exactly where the economy is going to go, given rising interest rates and some of the other things that are going on. Actually, you could say that in the data that we've been seeing that some parts of the economy started slowing down really in October-November. And we just didn't see it in our business because we couldn't meet some of that demand back then. But we feel really good about where we are. We're not going to chase top line growth. We're continuing to leverage our operating model, but we believe it's there to be earned, and that's the conversation we're having with our customers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JP Morgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Maybe just on that last part about unmet demand. We heard that a lot across the different Class I rail conference calls. And is there a way, since you're counting on it and you're seeing some of it through surveys and clearly, the service has improved. Is there a way you can sort of try to quantify that for us in terms of what you lost or what you think is coming back with fill rates or anything else you can put around there in terms of a metric? And what gives you that confidence that you can count on that coming back, not just the interest level is there, especially when you have a softer macro and probably contract truckloads heading lower as well?\nKevin Boone: Yes, Brian. Hey, it's Kevin. I think Joe actually touched on this really, really well. And I think what's probably a little bit underappreciated what's happened in some of the things that we've seen in some of the major markets that we serve today is -- and I had referenced this previously on other earnings calls, we were in that 60%, 70% type of order fill rates pretty much through most of 2022. What happened starting in, let's call it, the late third quarter, fourth quarter in some of these markets, we saw those orders come down. And obviously, our fill rates kind of remained -- or on mix or whatever our volumes that we're serving for those customers remained relatively flat. And so, we saw our fill rates start to increase, and they're at higher levels now and the markets we see maybe the demand, what they're requesting is down 30%, yet our volumes are slightly down today. What my expectation is and what we're starting to see is that they've already overshot what they saw what would be a normal demand environment, and we're seeing order flows start to increase. And so, that's encouraging that it feels like in some of these markets, we've established the bottom. Anything can happen in the economy, but it feels that way as of right now, and we'll see how it plays out. But a point on that is as those ores come back and as we're able to meet that demand going forward, that would imply growth versus last year. And so, that's embedded in what some of the guidance that we provided today and why we have a confidence around accelerating or beating that GDP number is that we're going to go and capture those orders and those demand that the customer has out there this year with the replenished workforce and all the things that the operations team is doing.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And would you expect that to be more heavily weighted on the merchandise side because that probably was a carload before, or are you seeing real momentum on truckload conversion, maybe more on the intermodal side?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think you'll see it really start on the carload side. That's where we -- when I referenced the order fill rates, that's really carload specific. You'll remember on the intermodal side, it really was an equipment issue. Good thing is those equipment issues, whether it's chassis, containers, I think we have plenty of those in most locations now throughout that market. And you've heard different commentary around that, but there is some softness in the truck market today. There is some optimism, hopefully, as we get into the back half of the year that that will firm up a bit, and we have every intention of taking advantage of that market as it comes to us. We have the premier service in intermodal and it's been reflected in our growth over the last couple of years, and we continue to expect to capitalize on that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ariel Rosa with Credit Suisse.\nAriel Rosa: So, I wanted to stay on that topic. You mentioned some softness maybe in the trucking market. I wanted to ask to what extent that's an impediment to intermodal volume growth. And then, in a more normalized environment, how do you think about CSX's ability to kind of outgrow GDP or maybe something around kind of the magnitude at which you could outgrow GDP versus this kind of loose truck market?\nKevin Boone: Yes. The truck market is obviously -- centers around our intermodal product. That's where we go direct with truck, not that we don't compete on our carload business as well, but that's where you see the sensitivity sometimes. In international market, as everybody is aware of, has been weak, and we've got -- we've had great growth there, and we have a great market that we continue to expect to grow over time. But, as I mentioned in my recent comments -- opening comments that that market probably will be down somewhat double digits in the first half of the year. And hopefully, as the economy stabilizes and there's some green shoots out there that we'll see some better growth into the second half of the year, at least, not the decreases that we're experiencing today. I think, every bit of intention here is across our portfolio that we're going to outgrow the macro economy. And I think there's a lot of things at tailwinds at our back. But we've had a huge success rate on our industrial development side. We have a lot of new projects that are coming online when you look out beyond this year. Big, big backlog, probably the largest backlog that anybody here can remember in a long time whether it's new auto plants, metals plants, all those across the board, we've really had a good success rate there, and that will give us growth going forward. So, our intention is to outgrow the economy. And I know that's not something that the railroads have been able to do. But I think there's -- with the service product that we're going to have, I think that's really, really possible going forward.\nAriel Rosa: Thanks for that Kevin. And then just really quickly on some of those projects, any thoughts on kind of what the incremental margins could look like around that?\nKevin Boone: I think -- I don't know a business that we're bringing on where the incremental margins aren't very attractive and are in a very good rate of return for us. I put my finance hat on every time I look at the business, and we're not going to chase unprofitable business just to show top line growth.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets.\nFadi Chamoun: Maybe first on those two boxes and the guiding principles, and Joe, you highlighted improving customer service and developing the employees. And especially with respect to some of the conversation maybe you're having with customers, do you feel that there's going to be a lag between when you start demonstrating the success on the service side and really penetrating that share of wallet with these customers, or do you think there is really a quick potential turnaround between kind of making those improvements in the time, that market share improvement? And second, maybe a follow-up on the test conversation with Kevin, now like looking over into 2024 to 2025 and assuming we're back into a normalized GDP, given the backlog that you have and given some of these initiatives and the investments you've made in QC and PanAm. Outside of coal, is there a reason why you can't grow volume mid-single digits as we get into this more normalized environment? Ex coal, obviously.\nJoe Hinrichs: I'll take -- this is Joe. I'll take the first part and ask Kevin to take the second since you directed at him. From my perspective, the opportunity here to grow the business really comes from increasing that service product. Now, your question around the timing of that, it's all really individually dependent on each customer, where they are, where their cost pressures, where their capacity issues and what are they looking for. So, we can't use a blanket statement that if we demonstrate these levels of performance for three months, the next comes from it. Really in our conversation with our customers, it\u2019s really around their confidence in our ability to be repeatable and reliable. And so the answer to that question is different for each customer. But I can tell you, they're all watching and they're all noticing and they're all letting us to know that they're really appreciating the progress that we're making. So, it will play out over time. But there's nothing inconsistent that we're hearing from our customers about their appreciation for it and recognizing how important it is. Kevin?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think the question was, is there a reason why we can't grow mid-single digits. I think Jamie answered the question on the network side, we have a lot of capacity to grow into and it's -- we're going to use that capacity and go after wallet share with our existing customers and identify new customers. So, there's no constraints from that perspective. Obviously, that putting up mid-single digits volume and then with price is a pretty attractive algorithm, we'll see what we can do and what the market conditions are at the time. It's a more normalized GDP growth rate, 3% or 4%, then that's different than maybe 1% to 2%. So, we'll see how things materialize as we get out of '23, and '24, '25. The great thing is we have some tailwinds from new customers that will be on our railroad, and that will give growth above the economy, hopefully, that will add to that algorithm over time as we build the funnel of all the projects that we've been able to develop and that will be coming on line in the future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Two quick ones here. First, you've said you can grow GDP plus. Many of your peers are using industrial production as a benchmark. In fact, I think one of them has come out and said a couple of years ago that they don't think they can grow faster than GDP going forward, and they think they can try and outpace industrial production instead. So, a, do you think GDP is the right benchmark for you and kind of what gives you the ability and confidence to think that you can grow faster in GDP in the long run? And just as a quick follow-up. I think you had said that incentive comp was a tailwind to numbers in '22. How do we think about incentive comp in '23? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. Ravi, this is Sean. So on your GDP plus comment, look, I think if you look historically and you run the correlations, our business tends to move more closely with the underlying IDP indicators, particularly across the merchandise segment, maybe a little more on GDP in intermodal. But you look at this year specifically, the projection for IDP is a decline and the projection for GDP is growth, and we think we can grow the business. So, it made a lot of sense this year to peg it off of GDP. On your question on incentive comp, I mean, the year has to play itself out. We always go into the year planning to hit the targets that we set internally. And so, on that basis, incentive comp would be down a little bit year-over-year versus 2022, but we'll see how that plays out as the year continues.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities.\nCherilyn Radbourne: A question on labor for me. Some of your peers have talked about taking a different approach to furloughs going forward, just given that labor has become more scarce and valuable. So, I was hoping you could offer some thoughts on how you would approach headcount in the event that freight demand surprises to the downside, so that you don't lose the investments you've made in hiring and training this year?\nJoe Hinrichs: Well, Cherilyn, thanks for the question. We've got the same stance as we did last quarter. Our T&E workforce is not a workforce that we would look at furloughing as we move forward. We're future -- we're looking into the future, really important that we -- Kevin and I obviously are -- as we stated here today, work really close together to see not only what's happening today, but what's happening in six months from now, what's happening a year from now. We know that there's customers coming on. And you're absolutely right. The conductors and filling those positions takes a long time. It can take up to six months to fill a conductor's position. And we can pull the trigger. Look, if there's a downturn in business, we can use the attrition that's there, which is up to 10%. So, it's easy for us to hold back classes if we need to, to bring those numbers down and rightsize it if we need to. But as we continue to move forward, we're looking at continuing to build our numbers up so we can get to a point where we can cover vacation time and making sure that our employees get the time off that at times they've struggled over the last couple of years. So, we're very close to that number, as you can see from our results that we're quite happy that we're moving in the right direction with our service. And it's a commitment that we've made that we're going to continue to be looking forward and not doing any knee-jerk reactions and pull that trigger with respect to attrition if required.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna.\nBascome Majors: Joe, last time you spoke with us on the October call, you had a few days on the job, that's a few months now. Can you talk a little bit about when you'll be able to -- or I think you'll be able to roll out your strategy to the Board and investors? And any events like an Investor Day, other format around that as you look forward to kind of getting to where you want to be to really kind of put your stamp on the business? Thank you.\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Thanks for the question. Just first, from a philosophy standpoint, this is a really talented team. And so, we -- we're doing all this together as a leadership team. We get together every Monday, we talk about the business, go through all elements of it. And so I want to just emphasize that. I'm one piece of that team, but this is a team effort. I'm really proud of the -- to get to work with every day. It has been 4, 5 months since -- role -- fast together. But 20-some visits out in the field and all the other discussions with all customers and regulators and everything else. I feel like I'm learning very quickly, but there's still a long way to go on that learning curve as far as the core business. I'm really excited about the emphasis we have on the customer, and I'm really proud of the progress the team has made on the operating side. All that to say, I'm not sure that -- I'm not sure it makes sense to have an Investor Day just to have an Investor Day. We want to do that when we really have some meaningful things to talk about from strategy or technology or some other things. So, we trust that we'll do that at the right time when it can be meaningful and not just something we put on the calendar every year just to do. We want it to be impactful. We don\u2019t want to take everyone's time and we want it to be important. As far as the strategy and discussion with the Board, I hinted this a little bit in October, but I spent a lot of time with the Board as individuals and collectively in consideration of doing this in their consideration of me. So, we had a lot of good conversation over multiple months about the opportunity here and where to put the emphasis and where to really take advantage of the strengths that exist here. And so, I feel really, really good about the alignment we have with our Board, with our team here and the work we're doing. And I'm very pleased with the progress we've made with One CSX in just four months' time or so. You can feel the momentum on the culture side, you can feel the momentum on what that means for how employees are working together and then the result effects on our service. So, I don't feel compelled to come out with some major strategy just because to put my fingerprints on it in some short time period. I think the key thing is, we have a talented team here, we have a strong operating model, we have a good business. I mean we made $6 billion on less than $15 billion of revenue last year, and we didn't perform our best last year. So, we're now starting to demonstrate those performance levels that we showed pre-pandemic levels. So, that's a long way of saying that I'm very optimistic about the business and excited about it. And you'll see incremental ideas, initiatives come out, but we really have a strong foundation. And really executing off of that foundation and leveraging the strengths we have is our biggest near-term opportunity, as you've heard the team talk about tonight. So, just trust that when we're ready to have some more meaningful dialogue on some new initiatives and whatnot, then we'll have the right forum to do that. In the near term, you'll continue to see us on a weekly, monthly basis, talking about the things we're doing and demonstrating where our priorities are. And that's really around, as we've said many times, improving our customers' experience with us and our service we deliver to them. And the experience our employees have as team members of ours as part of One CSX and just getting the most out of working together to make that happen. So, those points won't change over time, but how we use technology, how we use our operations and other initiatives will change, and we'll talk about that at the right time. But just to summarize what our team is saying here tonight, we're very confident about the things we can control in our business, our operating performance, our capacity now with our manpower, team we have, the skills and the capabilities we have. There's a little uncertainty about the health of the economy this year. So we watch that very carefully. But we feel really good about how we come into 2023, how we're performing so far in 2023 and the feedback we're getting from our customers. And so, we'll leverage that to show that we can deliver growth and that we can build an even stronger business. Thanks.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: So, Joe, I wanted to ask you a question on the intermodal share take a little bit differently. I'm just curious about your thoughts on what kind of targets you're going to be holding the team accountable to delivering over, call it, a 3- or 5-year view. As you step back and look at the intermodal market in the East, it's grown at about 38 basis points a year for the last 7 years. you guys are doing about 3 million units, and you were doing about 3 million units in 2015, '16. What should we be thinking about on a 5-year view about how much share you could actually put onto the railroad. Not looking at the guidance for this year because the economy is weak, and I get it's tough to forecast. But I'm just trying to think like what kind of target are you putting out there for the team to hit?\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Thanks for the question. I'm not going to get into specifics about what our targets are long term. But just conceptually, let's talk about it. Just stepping back and learning about this industry and staring at it more closely over the last many months, even before I joined CSX. We interchange a lot with a number of our Class 1 colleagues. And so, this is an industry issue as well as a CSX issue, and that is around real growth, volume growth. So you referenced it. So how do we make that happen? We have capacity. We have a strong fixed cost base, a very -- a substantial fixed cost base and incremental margins are really good. So, that lends itself to really wanting to grow, like most businesses, those kind of -- and we have strong margins to start with. So, how do we grow? As an industry, as a company, I mean that's the discussion we're having and the opportunities we're pursuing over the next several years. So, from our perspective, we need to demonstrate to ourselves and to others that we can grow volume ideally above either GDP or industrial production, whatever, where do you want -- ways you want to measure it year after year and bring the margins that come with that to show growth in the business, not just on pricing, but also on volume. That is something we're looking to do, and we'll continue to challenge ourselves to do. With that comes the customer service metrics and demonstrating continual progression there in things like trip lane compliance and first mile last mile, but also in with the way the customers measure things. Are the MTs there when they need to be there? Did the load get there when they need to be there? So they can manage their manpower and their business, et cetera. So, continual progress, Jamie referenced it on the customer side. And then on the employee side, with our employee surveys and with our relationships with our union leaders and our union partners, et cetera, how do we become the kind of environment where -- back what we've had over time where you have just all this multigenerational activity because people are so proud to be a part of the CSX team and how we work together and the culture that we have around each other. So, there's ways to measure those things and challenge ourselves to be accountable with showing progress. But, if you bucket them into those areas and then, of course, we will never forget the financial results. Those are largely outcomes of all the things we're talking about, but continuing to look at our operating efficiency, continue to look at our operating income, of course, -- and our cash flow, we will always do that. So without getting into specific, you can just think about where the emphasis points are and where the priorities are. And then, I've referenced technology a couple of times here tonight, and I want to come back to that. How do we leverage technology to be more efficient, to be safer, to better serve our customers and to modernize our business across the enterprise, whether that's in the office or in the locomotive. And we see a lot of potential there. Steve Fortune has joined us. We've got a great technology team. We're excited about that, too. So, a number of things to think about and challenge ourselves for the future. And we'll have more to say about it over time. But when we get to a point where we are definitely where we want to be with our employee relationship and we have a safe, trusting environment with our union partners, where we look for solutions and work for both sides and then improve the work-life of our employees while also serving our customers better and having a more efficient business, we can achieve all those things together. Those are the objectives. And I believe we'll get there, and we'll do it the right way.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. Jamie, if I could just sneak a little follow-on in there. As you think about the headcount plan from where we are today, are you expecting to continue to grow it into the year, or do you think we've got enough sort of resource on the property to maintain the service improvements?\nJamie Boychuk: I would say we are continuing to qualify conductors every week. We still have another 600 folks out there in training out in the field and some in Atlanta. And what we're doing as we move forward -- now remember, the retention rate has not been all that good with the new hires. So, if we continue to work on that retention rate, and we have a 10% all out with respect to just regular attrition as we move forward. I'm looking for another few hundred folks onto our headcount to get us into vacation season as we move forward and some of the growth that Kevin and the team see as we continue to move into the year. So, I'm comfortable with the headcount we have now, while the vacation season is low, but over the next few months, we're going to see that spike come up. And the way that we are guiding into that or gliding into that, our numbers are going to be able to hold up for what we need to not only continue where we are with our metrics, but to actually continue to improve on them as we move into the year. So, we are -- it's probably one of the first times in a couple of years, I've been on one of these calls, and I can say we're comfortable that our headcount is at a good spot and continuing to move into a good spot as we move into the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak-Cusic: Just want to circle back to that last question a little bit more. Joe, you had talked about some of the processes in doing business easier with rails. Could you maybe expand on that a little bit? Do you feel like in these customer surveys, the ease of doing business with rails is sort of a key limitation right now for some of that structural share gain? And is that something that's maybe within the next 2 to 3 years that you guys can attack that, or is it much longer-term opportunity there?\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Thanks. It's a great opportunity. And we do need to make it easier to do business. We recognize and we referenced that in our commentary tonight. I mean you think about the level of visibility that we have in the rail industry compared to packaged goods and UPS, FedEx, those kind of things, we have to improve in that area, and we will improve in that area. It's an industry issue as well as a CSX issue. That's an example. How do we get even more predictable and give more visibility to our performance and et cetera. So there's a number of ways we need to improve to improve the customer experience in our business, make it easier to do business with us. Kevin referenced, we've got some new things in ShipCSX to help with calculations for emissions reduction and those kind of things. How do we keep helping customers get better and be able to use our systems better and be able to work with those better. There's a number of ways we can make that happen. At the end of the day, the thing they want most from us, of course, is to be there on time and to deliver on time and to be reliable in doing that. So, that's obviously where our focus is. But clearly, we can make it easier for our customers to do business with us, and we can provide more information and visibility and that's some of the things that the industry is working on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets.\nWalter Spracklin: My question for Kevin, looking back now at Quality Trucking, I know this was a little bit of an experiment when you made that purchase, and I see in your CapEx plan you're devoting a bit of capital towards it. So just curious as to what your take has been on it now that it's been under your umbrella for a little while now. Is it by calling it out in CapEx, are you expanding the fleet? Are you strategically looking at growing your trucking operation relative to your rail operation? And could you be looking for any other avenues outside of the company and from an M&A perspective into that trucking space if you see those opportunities pop up here in 2023?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean, first of all, quality is a very, very unique asset in a lot of ways. First, it touches our most valuable market in our largest market, which is chemicals. And I can't tell you how insightful. They have different contexts than we do on the trucking side, where those purchase managers have never dealt with truck and introducing that product to them has been eye-opening and it's something very, very new. When we talk about the CapEx related to QC this year is really a rail product, it's not more trucks that we're investing in. It's the ISO tanks that go on the railroad. And I am -- if Randy was sitting here today talking about it, he is very, very happy with how it's gone so far. The customer uptake has been pretty incredible so far. We've seen a lot of success. And our only issue is we haven't gotten them fast enough. And so that's a good problem to have, and we're going to continue to take delivery of those. Randy has come from the trucking market for a long time, and he has even been surprised about the service product and how quickly we can turn these assets for him on each side. So, things have gone extraordinarily well there. The intermodal network is ideal to convert a lot of this traffic that moves over truck today. It's meeting the customer requirements, and we're getting more and more demand from those customers out there as it gets into the market. So, that's really where the focus and the uptick in the CapEx that we talked about earlier are coming on that rail product that we're extraordinarily excited about. And we just think that the chemical customers, in particular, are looking for a holistic solution and it's pretty powerful to go in there and be able to talk and look at their network and tell them what we think fits from a rail perspective and what fits from a trucking perspective.\nJoe Hinrichs: And just when you think about quality, even on the operating side, we're utilizing our current terminals. And yes, that CapEx is exactly right, where we're buying the ISO tanks and we're preparing. But everything else is already there, that fixed asset is there. So, this -- when we went into this, Kevin and I were somewhat hand-in-hand looking at this business thing is this what we want? Is this going to work, and it's really falling in really well. And I would say -- on the asset side is just we didn't get the ISO tanks. We'd like to get them quicker. We'd like to get more of them because there's more business, I believe that Randy and his team can get working with Kevin and his team. And our intermodal terminals have the capacity and the trains have the capacity. So it's just -- it's a great product on the operating side and very easy for us to move as well. So it fits really, really well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Kauffman: I'll just be quick. Sean, you were talking about employee levels, and it looks like cost inflation on the new contract, probably around 5% per employee. Year-on-year employees about 7%, 8% for the first half of 2023. So if I look away from fourth quarter where the incentive comp helped lower that and I looked at kind of what's the right run rate for modeling for labor cost inflation. Should I be thinking about something in the high single-digit, 10-percent-ish range for the first half of the year before productivity offsets that?\nSean Pelkey: Yes. Jeff, I think on a gross basis, right, on a full year basis, the impact of inflation on the labor line is in that ballpark, right, mid-single digits. And if you look at the headcount, if we didn't hire anybody additional all year long, we'd be up 4% year-over-year. Jamie talked about adding a couple of hundred to the headcount, so call that 5% up year-over-year. So, there's your 10%, but we are confident that as we -- as the network continues to spend, we'll be able to drive some efficiency on the labor line. We\u2019ll also cycle, as you alluded to, the true-up that we had to make in the third quarter on the back wages. So, that will be a little bit of an offset.\nJeff Kauffman: All right. So that will be a little better in the second half. But I guess at the end of the day, how much of that labor cost do you think you can offset through productivity? Is there a target out there? Do we just kind of see what we can achieve?\nSean Pelkey: Well, yes, we've got targets and we're going to reduce over time. We're going to reduce crude travel and some of the ancillary costs that go along with that as the network spins faster, and we'll be able to offset a good chunk of it, offsetting 5% inflation or sort of in that range and another 5% headcount would be a lot in a single year. So, we're on the right track.\nOperator: Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon, everyone. Safety remains our top priority at CSX and has been the foundation for our service restoration. As shown on this slide, a personal injury frequency index was flat from the third quarter and unchanged for the full year. The FRA train accident rate increased from the third quarter but improved versus the prior year. Most importantly, for the second year in a row, we ended the year without a life-changing event. These results were delivered with onboarding over 2,000 new conductors during the year and underscores the safety culture that runs deep within our One CSX workforce. Now hires learned the importance of operating safely in the classroom, but the most impactful lessons occured day in and day out on locomotives and in terminals working with more experienced employees. These daily interactions are reflected in our recent safety performance and emphasize the commitment to our operating safely at CSX. I would like to recognize the over 6,200 employees within CSX's engineering department, which set a record for the lowest number of train accidents in the department history. This is a true accomplishment, given the nature of their ballast-level work. In the year ahead, we will continue to instill the safety culture within our new hires, maintain that culture in our experienced employees and focus on the training and discipline we need to reduce human factor incidents. Moving to the next slide. You can see the success that our entire team has had in driving meaningful service improvement with a clear trend emerging around the middle of the third quarter as staffing levels at many of our locations reached key thresholds. Even with the temporary hit from the weather towards the end of the year, average velocity was up 11% sequentially in the fourth quarter, dwell was down 13%, and trip plan compliance improved by several percentage points for both intermodal and carload. This progress has not stopped as we crossed into 2023 with our service metrics continuing to trend towards pre-pandemic high water levels of late 2019 and early 2020. Our team is focused on improving network fluidity and delivering a consistent, reliable service that will encourage our customers to shift business onto our network, and the data shows that we are well on our way. Now turning to hiring. A robust training pipeline in over 350 conductor promotions over the fourth quarter allow the team to achieve our long-stated goal of 7,000 active T&E employees. Getting our resources to this level has driven the service momentum Joe discussed a few minutes ago. We will continue to support improved service into 2023. Going forward, we expect to stabilize active T&E headcount with targeted hiring continuing for key locations and to offset attrition. I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials. I think really, the only thing I can add to that is there's a lot of capacity out there. So what Kevin and I talk about is where is that capacity, what can we do with that capacity, and how do we get out there and sell it. My team is out in the field, ensuring that they are talking with customers more than they ever have because they have time to do that. Previously, we were trying to find a crew to run a train here or there or wherever else. Now they have the time to sit back and deal with any of those customer demands that might be out there that helps Kevin and his team grow. Some of those discussions we have are what does the customer really looking for? Is it the right metrics that we're looking at that the customers are looking for and that first mile, last mile improvement that the team has been able to put together is really record-breaking for us. If I look back at the last 6 years, we haven't -- '22, unfortunately, wasn't the best year for us, but exiting '22 with our customer service and in '23 are some of the world record numbers we just haven't seen. So, our job is to keep producing those numbers and making sure Kevin and the team has what they need to get out there and sell and commit to the customers that -- what you see out there is what you're going to continue to see. So some great collaboration between our two groups. Okay. And you're right. The last couple of years, really, we've seen our on-time originations drop. And that's been -- it's been consistent, unfortunately, because of the manpower situation we've been in. I'm happy to say, over the past three weeks into this year, we started to get back up to our record highs. The team is hitting up over 85% on-time, which is great. It starts to get us balanced. And as we continue to onboard some more folks, we'll continue to get that driven up to that record of, I think, in 2019, where we're up around 89%, 90% on-time origination. And that's what we're shooting for. So, it is important. It's an important metric we'll watch. We made some decisions last year to back off a little bit on that, so we could connect as much traffic as we could and not leave things behind when we did have a crew and make sure we took advantage of that crew, and we maximized what we could on those train starts. Not saying that we're letting that go at all. We're going to maximize what's on each one of these trains that we run out there car-wise, but we've now got the people to balance the assets across the network, and you can see it. If you take a look at our velocity, and you take a look at our dwell numbers just in the past 3, 4 weeks, you can see that the network is running much more fluid. We hit that magic number just into the new year that we're looking for that 7,000 T&E count. And actually, as a matter of fact, we're at 7,100 today. And we're going to push that number a little bit more to cover vacation coming up in the next few months. So, we're going to make sure that we've got the right headcount. We're going to make sure that we've got the right people in the right places, and we continue to drive those metrics that will drive the rest of the service metrics. I mean, again, TPC, whether it's carload, intermodal, all the rest of it that you see that we've put out there, we're starting to get back to our -- as a matter of fact, we're beyond our record numbers on some of those service metrics. So, we're going to provide a product that Kevin and his team can go out there and sell and start growing this company. I would say we are continuing to qualify conductors every week. We still have another 600 folks out there in training out in the field and some in Atlanta. And what we're doing as we move forward -- now remember, the retention rate has not been all that good with the new hires. So, if we continue to work on that retention rate, and we have a 10% all out with respect to just regular attrition as we move forward. I'm looking for another few hundred folks onto our headcount to get us into vacation season as we move forward and some of the growth that Kevin and the team see as we continue to move into the year.

And the way that we are guiding into that or gliding into that, our numbers are going to be able to hold up for what we need to not only continue where we are with our metrics, but to actually continue to improve on them as we move into the year. So, we are -- it's probably one of the first times in a couple of years, I've been on one of these calls, and I can say we're comfortable that our headcount is at a good spot and continuing to move into a good spot as we move into the year."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe. Turning to slide 7. Merchandise revenue increased 7% in the quarter, as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 2% decline in volume. For the full year, merchandise revenue increased 9% on 1% lower volume. 2022 merchandise growth was driven by higher fuel surcharge combined with an increasing pricing environment as inflation accelerated through the year. Looking forward to 2023, we have significant network momentum as we began the year, and we expect to leverage industry-leading service into growth opportunities with our customers. This is reflected in our recent customer surveys where we have seen a significant improvement in overall customer satisfaction scores. We see opportunity for solid volume growth in merchandise for the year, led by continued strength in automotive, our growing export plastics business and share gains as customers respond to our improving service. This growth is likely to be partially offset by weaker housing-related and domestic chemical shipments as we start the year. On slide 8, you can see fourth quarter coal revenue increase 20% on 9% higher volume and a 9% increase in revenue per unit. Full year revenue increased 36% on 1% lower volume and a 38% increase in revenue per unit. In 2023, we expect export coal volumes to grow in both, met and the thermal markets. So, we do expect benchmark indexes to decline from the elevated averages of 2022. We're optimistic about the potential positive demand impact of China's reopening. While on the supply side, we have a new 4 million ton met coal mine coming online this year. We also anticipate volume opportunity as we lap 2022 issues, including reduced production at some CSX-served mines and capacity limitations at the Curtis Bay and Mobile export terminals. We expect domestic volumes to be low -- be driven by low thermal stockpiles that remain below historical averages. Healthy inventory levels will allow utilities to better respond to natural gas volatility and more readily dispatch capacity to reduce stress on the U.S. power grid. U.S. steel production, which drives domestic coal consumption to benefit from a recovery in the automotive industry as well as higher infrastructure demand. Now turning to slide 9. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue increased 4% as a 9% increase in revenue per unit more than offset a 5% decline in volumes. For the full year, revenue increased 13% on flat volumes due to a 14% increase in revenue per unit. International intermodal markets continue to be negatively impacted by slowing activity, which looks likely to continue into the first half of 2023. Imports have declined and warehouses have seen elevated inventory levels. To help counter this, we are pursuing several initiatives to bring new solutions to our customers to help them reach new and existing markets. With our domestic intermodal business, we see opportunities even as the trucking market has softened. The team is focused on accelerating truck-to-rail conversions, and now with equipment constraints largely behind us, the team has more opportunity to pursue these initiatives. We are seeing existing customers and those that are new to intermodal adopt strategies to drive more of their transportation spend to rail. The team is doing a great job of identifying these opportunities and building the relationships to drive this growth. Finally, moving to slide 10. Let's discuss CSX's role in reducing our customers' emissions. As we pursue truck-to-rail conversions across the markets we serve, we are actively promoting rail's environmental advantages to our customers. We are increasingly looking for ways to reduce their own emissions. These are board level initiatives for our customers and the opportunity to choose rail over trucks provides real, measurable savings across the entire supply chain. In 2022, CSX customers avoided emitting 10 million tons of carbon dioxide by choosing to ship with CSX versus truck. We continue providing an emissions advantages for our customers, we need to keep innovating. We are not only piloting new technologies that should provide fuel savings like zero to zero, but we are exploring emerging technologies that can be implemented in the future and keep CSX at the forefront of delivering best-in-class efficiencies. Providing visibility to our customers is also a priority. I'm excited about the additional insights we will provide to customers to help them identify and convert incremental freight to rail by utilizing our updated carbon calculator platform that will launch in the first quarter. Lastly, we are proud of the recognition CSX has received for our sustainability efforts, with several of our awards listed on this slide. It is a priority for us to remain an industry leader in environmental stewardship, and we look forward to sharing more details on the several projects we have underway throughout the year. Now, let me turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations. Yes. Brandon, you did mention obviously, the remarkable improvement in our service that we've seen, and it's a real change, and there's a lot of excitement around this organization about it and what we can do going forward. Joe has brought both, Jamie and I and his teams together to talk about some of the key markets. And there's been a lot of interesting ideas that have come out of that where we can really leverage what we can do service-wise and what we can do creatively to create those opportunities for us. And those things are the fun part of what we do every day, and we're doing a lot less of that and a lot less of customer service and a lot more coming up with new ideas and having those discussions with our customers about growing. I'll tell you, I've had a chance to meet with a lot of customers over the last month or two. And every time, probably 90% of those conversations, we walk out with a lot more opportunities to pursue. Sometimes it means that we have to think differently. We have to introduce customers to what the intermodal product is or what we're capable of. And what we're capable of today is much different, obviously, than what we were capable of a year ago. And so, the team is getting together the whole sales and marketing organization. Jamie is going to spend time with them. I was going to spend time with them next week and it's off to the races. It's up to us to find those opportunities and really pursue them. But I'll hand it over to Jamie to talk about the upside. Yes. I think when you look at -- and look, three years -- or three weeks doesn't make a year, so we've got a lot of work to do as a team. But we -- I think you'll see over the last two years and through the pandemic that we really outperformed the industry and a lot of that growth that we mentioned before came on the international side. And we don't pay -- we don't spend a lot of time thinking about the other Class 1 railroads, but I do believe we probably have a little bit higher percentage of our businesses, obviously, exposed to that international market where we've had a great, great success, and we see a long-term outlook that's very positive for us. So, I think that's probably contributing to some of the things we're seeing here recently. But we've obviously had great performance and continue to think we'll win share in the market. The team has got a number of initiatives that will take form later on in the year and that will drive incremental business to the railroad. So excited of what we can do in the quarters ahead. Yes, Brian. Hey, it's Kevin. I think Joe actually touched on this really, really well. And I think what's probably a little bit underappreciated what's happened in some of the things that we've seen in some of the major markets that we serve today is -- and I had referenced this previously on other earnings calls, we were in that 60%, 70% type of order fill rates pretty much through most of 2022. What happened starting in, let's call it, the late third quarter, fourth quarter in some of these markets, we saw those orders come down. And obviously, our fill rates kind of remained -- or on mix or whatever our volumes that we're serving for those customers remained relatively flat. And so, we saw our fill rates start to increase, and they're at higher levels now and the markets we see maybe the demand, what they're requesting is down 30%, yet our volumes are slightly down today. What my expectation is and what we're starting to see is that they've already overshot what they saw what would be a normal demand environment, and we're seeing order flows start to increase. And so, that's encouraging that it feels like in some of these markets, we've established the bottom. Anything can happen in the economy, but it feels that way as of right now, and we'll see how it plays out. But a point on that is as those ores come back and as we're able to meet that demand going forward, that would imply growth versus last year. And so, that's embedded in what some of the guidance that we provided today and why we have a confidence around accelerating or beating that GDP number is that we're going to go and capture those orders and those demand that the customer has out there this year with the replenished workforce and all the things that the operations team is doing. Yes. I think you'll see it really start on the carload side. That's where we -- when I referenced the order fill rates, that's really carload specific. You'll remember on the intermodal side, it really was an equipment issue. Good thing is those equipment issues, whether it's chassis, containers, I think we have plenty of those in most locations now throughout that market. And you've heard different commentary around that, but there is some softness in the truck market today. There is some optimism, hopefully, as we get into the back half of the year that that will firm up a bit, and we have every intention of taking advantage of that market as it comes to us. We have the premier service in intermodal and it's been reflected in our growth over the last couple of years, and we continue to expect to capitalize on that. Yes. The truck market is obviously -- centers around our intermodal product. That's where we go direct with truck, not that we don't compete on our carload business as well, but that's where you see the sensitivity sometimes. In international market, as everybody is aware of, has been weak, and we've got -- we've had great growth there, and we have a great market that we continue to expect to grow over time. But, as I mentioned in my recent comments -- opening comments that that market probably will be down somewhat double digits in the first half of the year. And hopefully, as the economy stabilizes and there's some green shoots out there that we'll see some better growth into the second half of the year, at least, not the decreases that we're experiencing today. I think, every bit of intention here is across our portfolio that we're going to outgrow the macro economy. And I think there's a lot of things at tailwinds at our back. But we've had a huge success rate on our industrial development side. We have a lot of new projects that are coming online when you look out beyond this year. Big, big backlog, probably the largest backlog that anybody here can remember in a long time whether it's new auto plants, metals plants, all those across the board, we've really had a good success rate there, and that will give us growth going forward. So, our intention is to outgrow the economy. And I know that's not something that the railroads have been able to do. But I think there's -- with the service product that we're going to have, I think that's really, really possible going forward. I think -- I don't know a business that we're bringing on where the incremental margins aren't very attractive and are in a very good rate of return for us. I put my finance hat on every time I look at the business, and we're not going to chase unprofitable business just to show top line growth. Yes. I think the question was, is there a reason why we can't grow mid-single digits. I think Jamie answered the question on the network side, we have a lot of capacity to grow into and it's -- we're going to use that capacity and go after wallet share with our existing customers and identify new customers. So, there's no constraints from that perspective. Obviously, that putting up mid-single digits volume and then with price is a pretty attractive algorithm, we'll see what we can do and what the market conditions are at the time. It's a more normalized GDP growth rate, 3% or 4%, then that's different than maybe 1% to 2%. So, we'll see how things materialize as we get out of '23, and '24, '25. The great thing is we have some tailwinds from new customers that will be on our railroad, and that will give growth above the economy, hopefully, that will add to that algorithm over time as we build the funnel of all the projects that we've been able to develop and that will be coming on line in the future. Yes. I mean, first of all, quality is a very, very unique asset in a lot of ways. First, it touches our most valuable market in our largest market, which is chemicals. And I can't tell you how insightful. They have different contexts than we do on the trucking side, where those purchase managers have never dealt with truck and introducing that product to them has been eye-opening and it's something very, very new. When we talk about the CapEx related to QC this year is really a rail product, it's not more trucks that we're investing in. It's the ISO tanks that go on the railroad. And I am -- if Randy was sitting here today talking about it, he is very, very happy with how it's gone so far. The customer uptake has been pretty incredible so far. We've seen a lot of success. And our only issue is we haven't gotten them fast enough. And so that's a good problem to have, and we're going to continue to take delivery of those. Randy has come from the trucking market for a long time, and he has even been surprised about the service product and how quickly we can turn these assets for him on each side. So, things have gone extraordinarily well there. The intermodal network is ideal to convert a lot of this traffic that moves over truck today. It's meeting the customer requirements, and we're getting more and more demand from those customers out there as it gets into the market. So, that's really where the focus and the uptick in the CapEx that we talked about earlier are coming on that rail product that we're extraordinarily excited about. And we just think that the chemical customers, in particular, are looking for a holistic solution and it's pretty powerful to go in there and be able to talk and look at their network and tell them what we think fits from a rail perspective and what fits from a trucking perspective."

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Looking at fourth quarter financial results, revenue increased 9% and operating income increased 7% to $1.5 billion as top line gain outpaced several expense headwinds that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $6 million favorable compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $15 million. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9% as a result of favorable adjustments to deferred state taxes. Our expected tax rate going forward continues to be 24.5%. Fourth quarter net earnings increased 9% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 17%. Full year 2022 results were highlighted by top line growth of 19%. Operating income was up 8%, which includes a 4-point impact from the Virginia real estate transaction, resulting in 12% growth when adjusting for these gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expense. Total fourth quarter expense increased $210 million compared to the prior year, driven primarily by higher fuel costs and inflation. Fuel expense was the most significant driver of $129 million due to higher prices. Labor and fringe expense increased $23 million as the impacts of additional headcount and wage inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation. PS&O increased $54 million, primarily due to higher operating support and terminal costs, which will remain somewhat elevated near term as operations continue to improve. PS&O inflation is also running around 5% and the quarter included about $10 million of expense from obsolete inventory and technology write-offs. Depreciation increased by $33 million in the quarter, which includes an ongoing quarterly impact of about $20 million related to the completion of a periodic equipment study. As a result of this study and a higher net asset base, full year depreciation expense will be up approximately $100 million in 2023. Equipment and rents was relatively flat versus the prior year and gains on property dispositions increased $31 million. While we are always looking for opportunities to leverage excess real estate, we'll likely have a few small gains. We aren't expecting any significant sales activity in 2023 at this point. Overall, congestion-related expenses were slightly above $30 million in the fourth quarter, and part of that cost was incurred during winter storms at the end of the period. Despite elevated inflation and increased headcount, we expect to deliver strong cost efficiency throughout 2023, as better fluidity reduces terminal costs, overtime pay and other expenses. Now turning to cash flow on slide 18. Full year free cash flow of $3.7 billion decreased $100 million but was approximately $100 million above prior year results adjusting for the Virginia transaction. Operating cash flow increased over $500 million on higher earnings, more than offsetting approximately $350 million of additional capital spend from our continued focus on both, investing for the long-term reliability of our network, as well as identifying and executing high-return strategic projects. After fully funding capital needs, we returned nearly $5.6 billion to shareholders in 2022, including over $4.7 billion of share repurchases and $850 million in dividends. We exited the year with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, including $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we remain committed to a balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Amit, this is Sean. Yes. So, in terms of the yields, I think Joe sort of laid out our expectation on the coal side, perhaps a little bit lower just looking at the comparison versus some of the record levels last year, fuel potentially a little bit of a headwind on a yield basis as well. We'll have a little bit of positive mix, at least in the first half here with the pressures on intermodal, specifically relative to the growth that we expect in merchandising coal. So, that's the yield story. And then, in terms of the costs, I think there's a number of different categories. Certainly, with the intermodal terminals becoming more fluid as some of that traffic moves its way out of the system and start spinning again. We should see some costs come down and the terminals are in very good shape right now. We should see reduction in freight car rents as our cycle times improve and they have already, things like overtime and ancillary costs related to the crews getting hung up last year with delays in service and then locomotive maintenance as we're able to spend the assets faster here. So, those are a few categories where I would say we ought to expect some improvement this year. No specific number, no. I mean, we're going to have inflation headwinds, right? I think, probably in the 4% to 5% range. And our goal is going to be to offset as much of that as we can, both through taking out some of those extra costs that we carried last year as well as continuing to find efficiency gains across the business. Yes. Justin, we're not going to get specific in terms of the guidance itself. When you look at first half, second half, the volume comps on coal are a little bit tougher in the second half than in the first half. In terms of intermodal, Kevin talked a little bit about some of the headwinds we're seeing on the international side here in the first half of the year. Those are really sort of the big drivers on the volume side. And then, in terms of all the revenue, that coming down about $300 million for the year, obviously, second half of 2022 was higher than first half of 2022. So we'll be facing sort of a bigger headwind there. And in terms of overall operating income, I think we've laid out some of the factors, right? I think we feel great about our ability to recapture some of the share that we missed in 2022, given where the service product is, given that we've got the headcount that we need and we've got the assets that we need, which is why we're going to grow above GDP. We're going to see gains in merchandise and in coal. We've got a strong price environment. We've got the cost opportunities that I've talked about. And on the flip side of that, we have a few headwinds between the supplemental revenue, the other revenue piece, higher depreciation and probably lower real estate gains. So, those are the factors. But that being said, I think the fact that we are expecting growth. And as we add that growth to the system, we're going to add that strong incremental margins. Yes, Chris. So, on the -- obviously, the coal yields, there's no cost associated with that on the accessorials. There are costs associated with congestion in the terminals as well as needing to rent out space at container yards to move those containers around. So, that's part of the, call it, $150 million or so of additional costs that we carried over the course of this year. So, some of that will adjust down. And then, as we grow the business, our confidence is in the fact that we can grow it at very strong incrementals. And so, you put those together, and I think the question around what happens to the OR really depends on how much growth can we convert. We talked last year about the fact that there was demand out there that we weren't able to meet because we didn't have the crews that we needed in the right places. We've got those crews now. So, there's a real opportunity in front of us. Yes. Scott, on your question about how much growth, I don't think we're in a position to answer that one right now that you kind of run it through the model, but I think we've given you enough of the factors. And I think the fact that we sort of pointed to coal and merchandise as areas where we think we can sort of meaningfully outperform whatever the economic indicators that are out there is a reflection of the fact that we feel good about where we are from a capacity and service standpoint and the ability to sell into that market. But, we're not going to give you a specific number there. Tom, on your GDP question, roughly 0.5% growth is the GDP number that we're looking at. And so our guidance is to grow in total above that with intermodal headwinds and solid growth across the other markets? That's right. Yes. Ravi, this is Sean. So on your GDP plus comment, look, I think if you look historically and you run the correlations, our business tends to move more closely with the underlying IDP indicators, particularly across the merchandise segment, maybe a little more on GDP in intermodal. But you look at this year specifically, the projection for IDP is a decline and the projection for GDP is growth, and we think we can grow the business. So, it made a lot of sense this year to peg it off of GDP. On your question on incentive comp, I mean, the year has to play itself out. We always go into the year planning to hit the targets that we set internally. And so, on that basis, incentive comp would be down a little bit year-over-year versus 2022, but we'll see how that plays out as the year continues. Yes. Jeff, I think on a gross basis, right, on a full year basis, the impact of inflation on the labor line is in that ballpark, right, mid-single digits. And if you look at the headcount, if we didn't hire anybody additional all year long, we'd be up 4% year-over-year. Jamie talked about adding a couple of hundred to the headcount, so call that 5% up year-over-year. So, there's your 10%, but we are confident that as we -- as the network continues to spend, we'll be able to drive some efficiency on the labor line. We'll also cycle, as you alluded to, the true-up that we had to make in the third quarter on the back wages. So, that will be a little bit of an offset. Well, yes, we've got targets and we're going to reduce over time. We're going to reduce crude travel and some of the ancillary costs that go along with that as the network spins faster, and we'll be able to offset a good chunk of it, offsetting 5% inflation or sort of in that range and another 5% headcount would be a lot in a single year. So, we're on the right track."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter call. Joining me on today's call are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Foote, our outgoing President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In our earnings presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Hinrichs.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call. I'm excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as President and CEO of CSX. The entire CSX leadership team is here with me this afternoon, and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss our strong third quarter results with you. Our whole team is very motivated to build on our current momentum, strengthen our key relationships, provide better service to our customers and deliver profitable growth for years to come. We will achieve this through our One CSX culture, which at its core means one team working together to serve all our key stakeholders. As Matthew mentioned, also joining us on tonight's call is Jim Foote, who as you all know, led this company through its remarkable -- remarkably successful transformation over these last five years. Jim cares deeply about this railroad and its employees, and he has already been a great resource during my first several weeks in this role. I'll be happy to have his invaluable advice in the months ahead, and I want to thank him for all the help you have given me personally as I get the privilege to follow him. Jim, on behalf of everyone here at CSX, thank you.\nJim Foote: Thanks, Joe. As I have said on every earnings call since I took over as CEO five years ago, I am incredibly proud of every CSX employee who has been by my side as we transformed this organization into the best railroad in North America, a company that's safer, more efficient, more profitable and far more successful than when we started. I have the utmost confidence that Joe and this team will take this organization to even higher levels of success. This transition process has been underway for a long time. It was critically important that the Board and I ensure that a succession plan was in place when the right time came. Having seen CSX through the initial phases of our transformation, pass some unusual, to say the least, challenges. And now with our operating performance starting to get back to normal, it's the right time for me to step away. Joe is a great guy. He is very talented, and he brings a tremendous amount of operations experience in running a large, complicated industrial company. His years working with a diverse unionized workforce will clearly serve him very well. It's truly been an honor to serve as President and CEO of CSX, and I wish all of you and everyone connected to this railroad the best. And now back to Joe.\nJoe Hinrichs: Thanks, Jim. I promise you this team won't let you down. I am honored to be here on behalf of the entire CSX team. I've spent the last month traveling all across the network, visiting our facilities and meeting with our customers, our employees, union leaders, regulatory partners and government officials. At this point, I can tell you two things for certain. First, this is a fantastic railroad. Our people and our infrastructure are second to none and the principles of scheduled railroading that drive our successful resilient operating model are deeply embedded throughout the company. I knew that CSX was a very impressive place when I started did not appreciate how impressive it really is until I saw for myself how this team of skilled, dedicated men and women work together to move thousands of box cars and containers for our customers each and every day. Second, for as much as this company has achieved over its transformation during the last several years, there is still so much more that CSX can do. Rail is a low-cost freight solution. Rail is a freight solution with low emissions. Manufacturing investment in the United States is accelerating. We have great advantages in this market, and our customers should have every reason to ship more by CSX rail, but we have to focus our efforts to make this happen.  We have to make it easier for our customers to use our service. We have to provide better service to our customers. We have to engage with all of our employees, especially those out in the field serving our customers every day to ensure that we deliver the reliability that we promised.  And we have to challenge ourselves to nurture the kind of culture that fosters a nimble creative and market-leading company, while staying true to the operational discipline that makes this all possible. The concept of one CSX as one team working together to accomplish great things can be very powerful. We have to bring one CSX to life. We'll talk more about that in a few minutes.  But now let's turn to our presentation to review the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2022. CSX moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the third quarter and generated approximately $3.9 billion in revenue. Operating income increased 10% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, which include the effect of additional labor and fringe expense related to the tentative agreements reached with our unions last month.  Results this quarter also reflected lower real estate gains compared to last year. Earnings per share increased 21% to $0.52 a share. Our operating ratio for the quarter was 59.5%. Now let me turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for the details.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Joe. Turning to Slide 5. Third quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year with revenue growth across all markets. Overall volumes were up 2% as modest volume growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offset a minor decline in coal. Merchandise revenue increased 14% on 1% higher volumes, driven by pricing that reflects rising cost inflation and higher fuel surcharge revenue. We saw strength in the automotive market, where revenues rose 31% on 13% higher volume. Semiconductor challenges continue to ease and we see significant finished vehicle inventory that needs to move. Ag and food was also a bright spot as improving cycle times, as well as stronger demand for grain, wheat and ethanol and resulted in revenue growth of 25% on 10% higher volume in the quarter. Fertilizers and metals and equipment both saw modest revenue growth despite volume declines in the quarter. Fertilizer shipments continue to be impacted by reduced phosphate shipments and production facility turnarounds. Lower metals and equipment shipments reflect volatile commodity pricing and mill maintenance outages. Intermodal revenue increased 19% on 2% higher volume, as yields remained strong and supported by high fuel prices. International shipments were partially offset by lower domestic volumes, which reflected tight equipment availability and softer truck market. Intermodal demand remained strong in the quarter, with the team continuing to collaborate with customers and identify new opportunities, including a new international service line that contributed to growth. Customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service product in a challenging market, as they seek lower cost and lower emission alternatives to truck. Coal revenue increased 36% on 2% lower volume as pricing continues to benefit from strong export benchmarks. Volumes remain limited in the quarter due to production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the export terminals and general manpower shortages, though our crew availability did show improvement into the end of the quarter. We were also able to reopen portions of our Curtis Bay Terminal in September, which provides additional volume opportunities as operations normalize. Demand remains strong and we see opportunities to move more volume as some of these constraints ease. Trucking revenue increased 26%, mainly due to strong core pricing and higher fuel recovery. Other revenue increased largely due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage fees. The strong sequential increase was driven by continued limited warehouse capacity at customer sites. Looking forward, there is obvious macroeconomic uncertainty as the Fed remains committed to raising rates and addressing high inflation. Given this backdrop, the team is highly focused on its efforts to drive strategic growth opportunities that target truck and expand CSX's addressable market. As you've seen, our select site program continues to facilitate new customer partnerships. Last month, a key emerging domestic lithium supplier for the EV and battery markets announced the construction of a $600 million refining and manufacturing facility on a CSX serve site in Tennessee. We also have several other potential projects in various stages of development. We continue to see customers investing in new projects across our network. We're also moving forward with efforts to facilitate ESG solutions for our customers. Before year end, we will be releasing an updated version of our carbon calculator that is integrated within our ShipCSX interface. This new calculator will enable customers to drive into much deeper detail and understand in real time, the environmental benefits that CSX Rail can provide. Finally, we are also encouraged that service performance is on an upward trend and we expect to turn this positive momentum into additional opportunities with customers. I will now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations.\nJamie Boychuk: Thanks, Kevin. Safety remains our top priority at CSX and operating safely is the foundation to our service restoration efforts. In the third quarter, our personal injury rate and train accident rate decreased sequentially. Though we are not satisfied with our performance, I'm encouraged by our success, especially given the number of new employees across the network. As we mentioned last quarter, it is critically important to instill a culture of safety in our new T&E employees from day one. That emphasis on safety does not end when new employees graduate from training. It requires continuous attention throughout every railroader's career. To reinforce this, we are actively engaging with new hires and all of our employees in the field to discuss recent injuries and accidents, to ensure that we take each opportunity to learn from each other. In the fourth quarter, our efforts will continue to focus on making sure our employees are protected from incidents that commonly occur as weather changes. Increased education and awareness of seasonal safety risks will help our team become safer. Turning to slide 7, we are encouraged by the recent improvement in our operational performance. These strong results are a testament to the one CSX team and their unrelenting devotion to serving our customers. If we only look at the third quarter averages, train velocity, the well and carload trip plan performance all showed the deterioration versus the prior year, though intermodal trip plan compliance continue to improve 240 basis points. However, on the right side of each chart of this slide, shows the substantial improvements we have made throughout the quarter and continue into recent weeks. As shown here, in the most recent four week performance, all of these four key operational measures are above the averages for the third quarter 2022. But they're also ahead of third quarter 2021 performance. We are confident that these metrics show that our efforts to hire, train and retain new employees are starting to take hold and make a difference for our customers. Though we are encouraged by the operational momentum, we will not let up. We will continue to push forward and take actions necessary until service is fully restored to a level that our customers expect. We are promoting new conductors, allocating the appropriate number of assets and improving the overall reliability and operational resilience of our network. Turning to slide 8, in the third quarter, active T&E headcount reached the highest level since March 2020. Though the quarterly average shows a sequential increase of less than 100 employees, we exited the quarter with over 6,800, total. The hiring pipeline remains robust. And we averaged over 500 trainees again in the third quarter. We are determined to keep the pipeline full, allowing us to continue filling classes as we work towards our goal of 7,000 active T&E employees by year-end. Currently, we have over 700 employees in training and have additionally started locomotive engineer training. The number of conductors that finished training and marked up was down slightly in the third quarter as we cycled lower class sizes from earlier in the year. We anticipate this number to increase in the fourth quarter, as the class sizes have remained elevated through the late spring and summer months. Conductor promotions will continue to increase the active T&E headcount. Our efforts to minimize attrition that we highlighted in the last quarter are bearing fruit. We hire attrition in the preceding months have trended lower, and we believe our hiring initiatives and recent pay agreements for new conductors are a contributing factor. I will now hand it over to Sean to review the financial results.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. The favorable operating momentum, Jamie discussed was accompanied by strong revenue growth of 18% or $600 million, including gains across all markets. Operating income was up 10% to $1.6 billion as top line gains outpaced expense headwinds from higher fuel costs, inflation, and tentative union agreement impacts that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. The operating ratio was 59.5%, which, as a reminder, includes roughly a 250 basis point ongoing impact from quality carriers. Interest and other expense was roughly flat as was income tax expense. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%, lower than our statutory rate as a result of a favorable state legislative change. As such, net earnings of $1.1 billion, was up 15%, with EPS up 21%. Now, let's take a closer look at expense on the next slide. Total third quarter expense increased $460 million versus the prior year. Fuel was up nearly $200 million, primarily due to higher prices. Inflation remains above historical levels with $82 million of inflation across labor PS&L [ph] and rents. Labor inflation alone was around $50 million, which reflects the proposed wage rate increase from the tentative union agreements. In addition, we recorded $42 million of out-of-period expenses related to adjusting union labor accruals for the tentative agreements. The most significant piece of this is the impact of the proposed union bonuses. When you think about labor expense going forward, the $42 million is a net catch-up and will not recur. The base labor per employee, excluding this impact is expected to be the new run rate for Q4 and into the first half of next year. Of course, comp per employee will also be impacted by seasonality mix and other factors, but the full impact of the tentative union agreement is now in our base labor costs. Next, Quality and Pan Am combined for $46 million of higher expense with the increase split about evenly between the two. Quality expenses correlate with higher revenues, while Pan Am reflects the first full quarter of CSX ownership. The Pan Am integration process is well underway, and we continue to receive positive customer indications around strong growth opportunities as we invest to increase the speed and reliability of the former Pan Am network. Real estate gains were $33 million less than prior year, with volume and all other expenses increasing $66 million. While operating fluidity improved through the quarter, our hiring focus remains, and we incurred approximately $40 million of incremental costs related to T&E training, higher locomotive count, additional intermodal terminal activity and other congestion-related items. Volume-related costs and higher depreciation represented the balance of the expense increase. We do expect some of the congestion related expenses to continue into the fourth quarter, but view these costs as the first efficiency opportunities to be realized as we achieved sustained improvements in network performance. Now, turning to cash flow on slide 11. Year-to-date, free cash flow before dividends is down nearly $30 million, but up approximately $120 million, when adjusting for after-tax cash proceeds from the Virginia transaction. This is despite close to $225 million of additional capital spend, as we continue investing for the health of our network to support the quality in Pan Am acquisitions and position for future growth. After funding all the capital needs of the business, shareholder distributions have exceeded $4.3 billion this year, including over $3.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $650 million of dividends. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we expect to maintain our balanced opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with a review of our outlook as shown on slide 12. There is no change to our expectation for double-digit revenue and operating growth for the full year, excluding the effects of the Virginia real estate transaction. While there is uncertainty in the global economy, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this guidance as we look over the remainder of this year. As we mentioned in our earlier remarks, we are pleased with the positive momentum in our service metrics. And we continue our hiring and training efforts to ensure that we have the resources needed to build on these trends and drive improved network fluidity. We remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders, as you saw over this past quarter. And finally, we reiterate our priority to building a unified cohesive culture of ONE CSX that will strengthen the relationships we have with our employees, customers and all other stakeholders. This is a great company. And working together, there is so much more that we can accomplish. And that's why I'm so excited to be here. Thank you all. I'll now turn it back to Matthew for Q&A.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Joe. Now in the interest of time, I\u2019d ask that everyone, please limit yourselves to only one question. And with that, operator, please open up the line.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Can you talk a little bit about your learning curve, why your right background for the role, what you hope to accomplish? And I mean it's a general question. And then, I mean my more specific one would be on trucking, right? Like you talked about the rate ramp? And is that something that gets impacted by loose capacity, or is the chemical business just different from the trucking side? But I'll stick with the big on -- for you, Joe, to start with.\nJoe Hinrichs: Okay. Thanks, Ken. Well, I think Jim highlighted a couple of things, but certainly, the labor side of the business experience in the automotive industry is certainly very applicable to our situation that we're in now, when you look at working through -- with our labor union partners, tenant agreements and ratification and working through those issues. But more importantly, I had the opportunity to be a customer for 20 years of the rail industry and have shared a lot of those experiences with our team and have challenged us to continue to look at things from a customer perspective to make sure that we are holding ourselves to a higher standard of service and accountability for our side of this relationship. And I'm really proud of the work that Jamie and the operations team are doing to really show improvement in that area. Jim mentioned that obviously, the auto industry is a complex business. And so is the rail industry, there's different types of complexities. But from my background experience, I think a lot of that's applicable. But I would step back for a second and say, at the end of the day, it's the workforce, it's the people here that serve our customers. And when we bring everybody together and align around our core objectives and around our opportunity to serve our customers better and work together better, we can create an even better CSX, and that's an opportunity for us to bring home and to bring to life and really excited to be a part of that. I'll let Kevin handle the second part.\nKevin Boone: If I got your question right, on the chemical, you're asking about the chemical trucking quality and.\nKen Hoexter: Yes. Kevin, I guess, just obviously, what we're seeing in the market is just how pricing collapsing right on the spot basis. And I just want to understand, is the chemical business different in terms of the revenues we can expect from the trucking and other business, or is that something that's maybe more sustainable?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean you have to remember when we were looking at this business, it's a high touch customers really care about product quality and the brand awareness that they have for quality is very, very high. This is not a business that are typically moves around. And so what you've seen is actually, they've done a great job of attracting some drivers this year. And so that's been -- I think they've done an excellent job versus the market there. And then Pricing has been very, very good and continues to remain that way. And so that's what we continue to see. It's a very, very different market. It's not -- people have to be highly trained, highly skilled to do that business, and they have a great workforce doing it.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Kevin\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nScott Group: Hi, Thanks, afternoon, guys. Sean, maybe just any near-term color guidance on the other revenue, the labor comp per employee, anything on operating ratio in Q4. And then, Joe, just it sounds like more of a focus on service culture, so maybe, I guess, more of a growth focus. I guess how are you thinking about the ability to grow and improve operating ratio over time, or is it more just about growth, or is it both? Just your big picture strategy going forward.\nSean Pelkey: Scott, I'll start with the sort of modeling questions. In terms of other revenue, what we've said for a while here is that we do expect it to normalize as supply chains get back to normal. Clearly, that didn't happen here in the third quarter with the increase that we saw in the other revenue line. But the expectation remains the same that we should see it come down in the fourth quarter and again into next year. To your other point around comp per employee. I think the best way to think about that is to take the $42 million we talked about, which was the out-of-period expenses related to the tentative Union agreement, strip that out of labor -- and that's the employee run rate that you're probably going to want to use going into Q4 as well as into the first half of next year before the next increase takes place in July of 2023. I'll let Joe take the second part of the question.\nJoe Hinrichs: Thanks, Sean. And thanks, Scott. I think the way I'd like to describe it really is just on how we're looking at this is just to step back for a second I had the opportunity throughout the summer with all my conversations with Jim and the Board to really take -- to get educated on tailor railroading and get educated on CSX. So the way I like to describe is how we're looking at things is the five guiding principles of scale in are really around improved safety, improved customer service, control costs, improve your asset utilization and engage and then ultimately, value and evolve your employees. And so if you take a look at all five of those things, they're all very important. And so operating ratio is a big part of looking at controlling costs and your asset utilization and frankly, a number of other pieces that go in there. So clearly, that's a very important number for us and a very important part of our objectives. Improving safety, as Jamie talked about earlier, is really important and we'll never ever get away from that in this industry. The other two areas around our customers and employees are opportunities for us. So how do we leverage our strong operating model that we have here that Jim and the team have built over a number of years to continue to improve the service we provide our customers and the experience and the engagement our employees feel as part of one CSX team. Now how does that lead to growth?  I'll tell you a couple of ways. One, with the increased service performance and the manpower that we're putting on that increases our capacity, which we now can leverage to quickly provide for our customers. I've had the opportunity to reach out and have video calls with about eight of our largest customers over the last couple of weeks and almost every single one of them has told me directly to our CEO or COO of all those customers, they've all told me that when you deliver a better service and more reliable, predictable service, we want to do more business with you.  So, we'll have to chase growth by trying to do unnatural things. We need to continue to do the things we're doing, leverage our operating model to continue to deliver better service and with that increase the headcount and with that comes the opportunity to serve our customers better. And because we're a lower cost, because we're better for the environment because of all kinds of other reasons, there's opportunities for us to grow the business that way. And that's the way we look at the opportunity through better customer service through increased capacity through the manning, we have the opportunity to serve our customers and there's more opportunity for us there.\nScott Group: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBen Nolan: Thanks. I appreciate the time guys. I wanted to get back to the coal side of it a little bit. Those outages have kind of continued both at the mines and the ports and appreciating that we're sort of now getting back to normal. Given the demand that you're seeing from your customers, is it possible to give any color as to how much incremental volume is achievable, let's say, in the next six months or however long it takes for some of these bottlenecks to normalize? How much better is it than it used to be or than it currently is, do you think.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think probably the gating factor as we get into next year, and we obviously are confident in resolving our labor issues as what can the producers actually produce. Coal mines are \u2013 have been undercapitalized, quite frankly, and now have a lot of money in there looking for equipment, reinvesting. And so, I anticipate it will get better. We also do have a mine coming online middle of next year that will help us and we have a number of them that are still ramping up.  So. production looks like it could be up next year, knock on wood. We probably would have said that last year at this time, too. So -- there's a lot of things that can happen as you \u2013 we mentioned previously on the call, we've had some mines that have struggled, but are coming out of that here recently into the fourth quarter. So optimistic on the production side. There's clearly a need when you look at the utility coal mines are the utilities that we serve, particularly in the South. They have a lot of inventories; they need to replenish and so we anticipate a lot more consistent deliveries over the next year to really replenish those levels and we continue to see the export market very, very strong and a lot of geopolitical risk out there in Europe and other areas where you probably didn't see as much demand a year ago, continue to have a lot of demand. So mind you want to serve that, it's profitable for them, and we anticipate to have the resources to be able to deliver going into next year.\nQ \u2013 Ben Nolan: Okay. I appreciate it. Is that sort of if you're just categorizing areas of the business, that's probably the one area that we're looking into next year, there's the best growth potential? How do you think of it that way?\nA \u2013 Kevin Boone: I think on the volume side, remember, we kind of moved with the commodity price on the international market. So depending on what that does, they're at very, very healthy levels today. A little bit down from the highs that we saw previously in the year, but that I think that will be the biggest factor as we look at overall coal revenue for the next year.\nQ \u2013 Ben Nolan: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Amit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everyone. Joe, hearty congratulations to you. I wish you the best, and Jim will miss you. I'm sure you'll miss all the 50 conferences and all the questions that we ask you, but hopefully, you'll find something else to do. So congratulations to both of you all. Sean, I wanted to ask you about the cost structure ex-fuel. Obviously, the fourth quarter -- but I'm really kind of interested in how you think about it for 2023, because that we're obviously still in a pretty high inflationary environment. And just related to that, Kevin, once Sean talks about that, can you just talk about your confidence in being able to grow the franchise enough to actually see earnings growth and EBIT growth next year relative to 2022. Just what your level of confidence is in given some of these idiosyncratic volume factors netted out against obviously some uncertainty on the macro side?\nA \u2013 Sean Pelkey: Thanks, Amit. I'll get started on the cost question. So I mean, think about the fact that the labor cost has now been reset. So we know what our base is kind of going into next year. Inflation doesn't show any signs of abating here more broadly outside of labor and recognize that some of our costs are based on lagging indicators, meaning they'll get set based on where the inflationary rates are in 2022 for next year. So there's no doubt we'll be in a sustained inflationary environment going into next year between labor and some of those outside party contracts that we have. That being said, we've been carrying extra costs here throughout the year as the network has not operated the way we would have wanted it to based on not having enough proves in the right places. That problem is rapidly getting fixed here. You can see it in the numbers over the last couple of weeks. And so some of those costs are probably going to be a bit sticky going into the fourth quarter. But as we get into next year, I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to drive some efficiencies and take some of the cost out to help offset the inflationary headwinds that we're going to see.\nA \u2013 Kevin Boone: Yeah. My confidence level, I'll tell you where my confidence level is. I'm confident in what the team is doing and what we're going to be able to control going into next year. And there's a number of factors, obviously, that are out of our control, but we have a tremendous amount of initiatives that are really taking hold and are really going to capitalize on the service product that we expect to deliver next year. As Joe mentioned, there's a lot of customers that I want to give us more share what they're producing and what they're making out there. And so we have a lot of those initiatives in place that will reap benefits as we move into next year. And that's where my confidence lies. We started the process very, very early in terms of looking at those, realizing that there could be different markets that can move around on us next year. But we know through them -- what's happened during the pandemic is the railroad, in particular, all of us really haven't participated in the growth that existed out there. And so that's our objective to position ourselves no matter what the economy holds that we're taking our fair share and then more of it. And so that's where the confidence is very, very high across the whole team. And we were just with our short-line partners. And I think there's a lot of confidence there that they have opportunities to go out into the market and take share from truck.\nAmit Mehrotra: Yes. That makes sense. And Sean, I just wanted to follow-up just one quick point on what you said. So if I look at your cost base ex-fuel this year, it's kind of like $7.3 billion. It seems like 4%, 5% inflation off that number is kind of the right structural costs that go up. But, I guess, what you're saying is, listen, there's a lot of inefficiency $40 million a quarter in 2022. So maybe there's an opportunity to actually, if the fluidity gets better, is actually an opportunity to see net inflation lower than that. Is that -- would you say that's a fair characterization?\nSean Pelkey: Well, I mean, we're going to see how much cost we can take out based on how well the network spends. But I think the general premise that you're thinking about is the right construct, we got $40 million to $50 million a quarter this year that as we cycle better, should go away. Is there more opportunity beyond that? Sure.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Jamie, I think last quarter, I asked you about capacity as you're still trying to ramp up the labor force. Now it feels like you're pretty close to rightsizing the network from a labor perspective. We've talked a little bit about some of those excess equipment you have on the network today, what would you estimate the spare capacity is today on the network to take on new business, meet this demand that you've been leaving on the table for much of the last 12 months. And, I guess, the other way to phrase it, too, is if we do go into a pretty deep downturn, is that capacity that you'd be willing to kind of flex off the network for a short period of time, or it's something you want to keep to make sure you're never short, again, given some of the labor issues?\nJamie Boychuk: Thanks for the question, Jon. When we take a look at the capacity that we currently have out there right now, it's all about people, people, people. And we've been saying this quarter after quarter after quarter. And you're right, we are getting closer to our targets, but we're still a few hundred people off. So we have pinch points out there that isn't as flu as we want. You can see in our numbers that we're starting to -- the velocity is picking up or dwells coming down. Even our trip plan performance is creeping up, but definitely not where we want it to be. So over the next couple of quarters, really, you're going to start to see that momentum continue to pick up. And as Sean mentioned, yes, we still have too many locomotives out there. And the velocity will help us on that end. And even our cars online are higher than where they should be. So as we continue to move forward, there is a lot of cost opportunity there for us to pull out. But -- and as we do that and as we move quicker, easily I mean, we've said this years ago, but there's easily the capacity that's out there with the right manpower, we've always said 10%, 15%, 20% capacity with the way that this plant is set up isn't really that big of an issue as long as we have the people to move it. We've got all the assets we need and we are blessed with a fantastic network here at CSX with double track, long sidings and some good yards that can handle a lot. And an operating team out there that's just doing fantastic. So they've proven to us time and time again, that we have that capacity to continue to grow. So this is still a people story for us as we move forward. Now, when we talk about that, and as you mentioned, I mean, that pent-up demand has been discussed a number of times from Kevin and other folks, what is that pent-up demand that's out there? Is that 4%? Is that 5%? Is it 10%? I mean a port number -- a different number of what that really can be out there. So, if we see a dip in the economy, we expect to be able to start picking up some of that freight that we can't pick up today. And for us, we just need to have a -- stay with the forward-looking view on what's going to happen in not just next month or two months from now. But we want to look at nine months from now, 10 months from now and really protect that TV head count that we have. And if we get into any type of situation where we needed to do something different, there's natural attrition. Our natural attrition is 8% to 10% each year. And if we needed to pause classes, we're able to do that. But ultimately, we want to protect that T&E workforce that's there. As we just mentioned, Sean mentioned and I did, I guess at the start of the question, there's a lot of other levers we can pull throughout the organization. So as a team, I think we would all sit down and have that discussion and we will make sure that we rightsize our assets and railroads are always heavy on assets. So we've got a lot of great cost savings we can do on that end. But all in all, we want to protect that T&E workforce and forward-looking. And as -- if some type of a softening in the market comes, we're going to be prepared come out of it strong. We'll be prepared to get all the traffic that's out there, and we're going to come out of this stronger than we ever have if we get into that situation.\nJon Chappell: That\u2019s great detail. Thanks so much Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Good afternoon. Wanted to see if you could offer maybe a quick thought on operating ratio in fourth quarter versus third quarter. Another railroad reported earlier today, Union Pacific and I think, surprised people a bit with talking about worse to normal seasonal OR in 4Q versus 3Q. So I wanted to see if you could offer a quick thought on that. And then for Kevin, I think in a higher inflation environment, you'd like to get more price, but the counterpoint to that is that the truck market is weaker and you do compete with truck. So how do you think about those factors? Can you get more priced because you have more inflation, or should we be mindful of lower truckload pricing and that's kind of a barrier to getting more price. Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Tommy, I'll start on the Q4 OR question. So, I think typical seasonality, it's not always this way, but usually, it's a little bit worse from Q3 to Q4, and that's primarily because we start to wrap up some of our capital projects, and we've got some winter-related expenses that hit. So, all reason to believe that, that same dynamic would occur this year. Some of the other things that will impact the operating ratio going from Q3 to Q4, fuel was a benefit here in the third quarter because of the positive lag that we had. If fuel prices stay relatively constant or follow the forward curve, we would expect that fuel is going to be a bit of a sequential headwind to the OR. It could be 100 basis points or more based on where the forward curve is right now. So that's just a little bit of noise. Beyond that, hopefully, we're able to pick up some volume as the network starts spinning, take some costs out. So those are good things. And then I think it's a matter of what do we see on the intermodal storage side because that can be a bit of a swing factor for us as we sit right now.\nKevin Boone: Hey Tom, on the trucking environment and other things, I think what you have to remember is we don't really operate in the spot market when the truckers are getting 30%, 40% rate increases, that's not what was occurring on our end, and we have a lot of long-term agreements with customers that they understand. And the good news right now, we're seeing our customers get price, and they understand some of the cost pressures we're facing. And so we're having those constructive conversations with them. And I think the spreads maybe versus truck aren't as great as they were before, but you have fuel surcharge, which is very high right now, and we know that flows through the truck rates. And so there's still a very, very compelling value proposition for customers to shift from rail -- from truck to rail. And so, we're still leaning into that, and there's a lot of appetite that we continue to hear of companies wanting to do that and for the environmental reasons as well.\nTom Wadewitz: Okay. So it sounds like you're not overly concerned about the kind of maybe falling truckload contract rates, you're still pretty optimistic on price?\nKevin Boone: Yeah. That was participating in the 30%, 40% rate increases, maybe that would be more of a risk, but that wasn't the reality of our business model.\nTom Wadewitz: Make sense. Okay. Thanks for the perspective.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So, maybe a quick labor follow-up first for Sean, looking at taking out that $42 million, as you mentioned, getting around $33,000 per employee. I don't know, so it's not a huge step up really from a year-over-year perspective from what you reported. So, if you can help decipher that a little bit, something I'm missing, maybe there's been some incentive comp or maybe mix with Pan Am now in the first full quarter. So any thoughts on that would be helpful as we take that and run forward with it? And then just maybe a quick one for Jamie as well. When you think about the service recovery and you're performing, I think, best against some of the STB targets that we see in track. How long does it -- you mentioned the pent-up demand, like are you seeing that come back? Are shippers still worried about a potential second slowdown or potential shutdown with the union agreement still not completely in hand? So, what do you think about the near term, and how long does it really take for you to benefit from some of those service gains? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: So on your comp per employee question, yeah, the math is right, and it really is just the inflationary impact over and above the settlement. So, I get to right around $2,000 per employee for that -- for the $50 million, a little bit more than that. The small mix impact from having more drivers at quality, which is a little bit lower comp per employee than a railroad worker, but that's really the only offset.\nJamie Boychuk: You can already see our gains in service with the headcount that we've seen rise. So, as we continue to qualify 20, 30, sometimes -- some of the weeks coming up here, 40 employees a week, you should continue to see that trend move forward. Now we've got winter coming. So winter always throws a few challenges at us when we look at our service metrics. But our customers are feeling better now. I can tell you that are from where we need to be. And we're feeling it out in the field the discussions that we have -- Joe and I have spent a lot of time out in the field over the last few weeks and the discussion points our men and women who are making this happen each and every day, whether it's on the ground or in the towers on the service side delivering, everyone is feeling it. We're starting to feel the railroad run better, we're starting to feel the numbers of the cars moving faster. So that's the big highlight that we're excited about and confident that we're going to continue to move forward on these metrics.  And look I don't like to comment on any anything that's helped for ratification. I think it's important that we allow our union leaders to have those discussions with the employees that are out there and then any other ongoing discussions and negotiations. We prefer to really not make any comments on that and allow the folks who are working on that to just continue doing what they're doing.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Understood. Sean, was there any incentive comp impact in this quarter like there was last quarter?\nSean Pelkey: No.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Thanks for time. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes, thanks good afternoon. I guess I think there's been a perception that the demand level that's out there is decently been above what the service has allowed you guys to carry? And I guess \u2013 as you think about some of the macro crosscurrents out there, potential headwinds, is that still the case? Do you think that demand is still maybe meaningfully above what you're able to provide from a service perspective? And I guess, as you think out maybe shorter term, 4Q in particular, should we start to see the weekly carloads begin to ramp up as the service improvement become sort of more realized in the numbers? Just want to get a sense of kind of how you guys are thinking about that? And then maybe a second point, but related is if we do see things get a little bit worse, how quickly do you think you can respond in terms of heads, whether it be your willingness to furlough or just using attrition Jamie, I think you talked about a pretty heavy attrition number. Is that something that you guys would be able to use relatively quickly in response to slowing demand?\nKevin Boone: Why don't I touch on the first one, and maybe I'll hand it off to Jamie on the second part of that. Look, I think you're well aware, our network more than well over half of our business such as another network out there, another railroad. And so, it's important for the industry to work together to capture some of these opportunities we continue to talk about.  Clearly, there's a market like housing that are seeing slower signals. But there's other areas like coal and some of the ag products that we're seeing great signs there. And even if in some markets where there could be some slowdown, I think the magnitude of the slowdown is what would be a question for us because there's demand that we haven't been able to meet.  And quite frankly, a lot of our customers haven't been able to meet because of some of their labor issues, the demand that they see out there. So, it's just not all CSX. It's the whole supply chain catching up and we're one part of that. So, we're demand ultimately settles out, I think, is somewhat of a question, but we do see from a share perspective, and that's an important thing, a lot of opportunity to win wallet share with existing customers and we see a lot of new customers willing for maybe the first time coming to us and saying, well, how does rail work and how could we provide a service for us. And those are the things that we have to lean into as we go in and we have some uncertainty in the market, and I'll hand it over to Jamie.\nJamie Boychuk: Well, when I -- looking at the question, kind of as I answered it earlier, we got to stay forward looking. Can we pull costs out quick? Well, absolutely, we can. I mean, our locomotives, when you think about that, that's a daily cost. You put it down tomorrow, you stop paying for it tomorrow. I mean these are assets that have been around a long time. And we haven't bought a new locomotive in many years, even though we have a rebuild program other than depreciation, the heaviest cost of a locomotive is which you use every day on them. So, I mean, that is one example of costs that we can handle. And on our T&E side, it's important that we continue to build our T&E workforce where we need it to be. And if we get into a position where things get deeper or things look differently, that attrition, as you mentioned, Chris, it is a heavy attrition rate, and we're able to use that as just a natural way to control our numbers. And by pausing classes, if we get to that, those numbers will take care of themselves. But we -- on the T&E side, and I'm going to keep emphasizing that, we -- it's a very important position like any other in the company, but it takes four months to six months to make a train conductor. And if we get softening market and we come out of this, we are going to be prepared to handle all the traffic that comes back at us and that's a commitment that we're making, and we're going to continue to follow through on that. So all those other levers, there's a lot we can pull in this industry. We want to make sure that we're prepared to come out of any softening if we get to that point.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks. Good afternoon. Sean, are there any thoughts that you can share on your expectation for total volumes and coal RPU moving into the fourth quarter? And then, Joe, congrats on the new role. Congrats to Jim as well. Going back to the question on growth versus margins, I think, it's clear you're focused on improving service, improving the customer experience. Do you think that requires additional costs and a need for margins to take a step back in 2023 to set the stage for future growth, or do you think there's enough cost opportunity from running a more fluid network so that margins can improve next year?\nKevin Boone: I guess, I'll take the coal one. I think you could expect -- we're hopeful that some volume step up given the network starting to get more fluidity and some of our producers starting to perform a little bit better. So at the margin, maybe a little bit of better to the benchmark prices. So those have come down. They're still very, very healthy, but that would also impact what we would see in the fourth quarter from an export coal RPU perspective. So a little bit down probably sequentially there, given that we're already a little bit into the quarter and those numbers are down from third quarter.\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Thanks. So this is Joe again. From my perspective, first of all be very clear, our goal is to leverage our strong operating model and our operating ratios to give ourselves some more capacity, to give that incremental volume opportunity that should be very complementary to our margin performance. So we should not have to chase share by degrading our margin. In fact, that would not be wise. It takes a lot of volume to make up for a point of margin. So to be clear, we're really focused, as you've heard over and over tonight about the opportunity to keep this momentum going and leverage our great operating model the team has put in place here to free up that capacity with the manpower to then allow for us to naturally provide more volume to our customers that they're asking for. And that's really what our focus is for the growth side.\nQ \u2013 Justin Long: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Ari Rosa: Hey, good afternoon. So Joe, I wanted to stick on this question of your background and your experience. But maybe you could talk about what are the learnings that you take from dealing with labor unions in the auto industry that you think carryover to railroads. And then from a customer standpoint, maybe you could give a little more color on what you've shared with your new teammates at CSX about what the customer experience is like from a customer standpoint? And maybe what was being missed internally or if there was anything that was being kind of misunderstood internally about what that experience is like? Thanks.\nA \u2013 Kevin Boone: Yeah, thanks. So on the labor front, I really applaud Jim, over the last couple of quarters have spoken very openly about the need and the desire of this industry to have a better relationship with its union partners. It's a complex relationship. There are 12 different unions and there's industry bargaining. So those things are a little bit different than the auto industry. But at the core, I believe that if you can develop relationships and spend the time listening to each other, you can get into interest-based bargaining which this team has some success doing here at CSX to find solutions that are in the best interest on both parties and can find win-win solutions. So we were able to do that. It took time, maybe decades to get there in the auto industry, but certainly, I was fortunate to be a part of that. And it won't take us that long here because we're already -- we've already experienced what we experienced lately. And I think we all recognize if we keep doing the same thing, we're going to end up in the same place in a couple of years, and I don't think any of us want that to happen. So big opportunity there and really leaning into that. I've already met with some of our key union leaders. And Jamie mentioned we've been out in the field talking to employees. We've been talking to union leaders here and out in the field and really just want to start building that relationship so we can form opportunity to work together to find solutions that are in the best interest of our employees. If we put our employees first because they're the ones serving our customers every day, I believe we can mutually find areas of opportunity to make progress together. And so on the customer side, challenging our team, especially Steve was coming on the technology side and all of us here to think about what would it take to be able to provide the type of service our customers should expect from us in 2022 and beyond in terms of not only living up to our commitment around the trip plan compliance or having cars ready or those kind of things, but also around visibility, around transparency and communication because some of the frustrations that we experienced on the other side of this was really around transparency and visibility, and there's lots of opportunity for us to get better as an industry and frankly, as a company in that regard. And just really go back to core principles of why we're here. We're in business to serve customers. And so they pay us to -- and they always pay us to honor our commitment and we need to do a better job of honoring that commitment. And you've heard Jamie talk about that a lot. You've heard Kevin reference it. And this team is really committed to delivering to our customers in a better way. And CSX was able to show significant improvement really right before the pandemic. This place was showing dramatic improvement in those kind of metrics and then, of course, got little sidewall that's going to happen with COVID. We want to get back to there. As Jamie said, that's our base camp. We want to get back to there and then we want to -- we expect ourselves to go further from there. So it's really just keeping the employees and the customers at the forefront of everything we do, because they're mutually exclusive on how they work together. If our employees are engaged and feeling good about the culture and about how they're working together, we can deliver we can deliver better service to our customers, obviously, help with less attrition and attracting more people and all that stuff reinforces itself. Thanks.\nAri Rosa: Okay, wonderful. Thanks for the thoughts.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good evening, everyone and thanks for the question. Jim, I don't know if you're still on, but congrats on retirement. And you want to comment on what you found the most successful the last five years and what was left unturned, I think we'd all appreciate it. And Joe, welcome to railroading. And I guess to your answer on that last question, how do you see the ONE CSX culture fitting into that customer relationship and focusing on the right priorities?\nJim Foote: Well, sure. I've just taken a little nap here. That's okay. The biggest success is what you're listening to today in this room. Five years ago, there wasn't an executive team, it was me. These guys are all in new roles, all doing a phenomenal, phenomenal job. I said and oftentimes everybody our owners agree is the best railroad tenor. This is the best management team in the railroad business, and it's the thing that puts a big smile on my face, especially today when I'm getting out of here.\nJoe Hinrichs: Thanks, Jim, and I thank you from the above of my heart, because I'm equally excited about the team we have here, and I'm blessed to be able to work with everyone that you put together, and it is a great team. On your question on ONE CSX, the initiative -- the culture initiative was rolled out before I got here by the team, which I really appreciate the attention and the focus on that. At the end of the day, if we're going to make more progress as in rail industry and then here at CSX, we have to have a better relationship with our union partners and with our workforce out in the field doing the work that creates the value for our customers every day. So really focusing our energy on CSX about being -- recognizing we're all part of one team. We're all valuable. We should all be appreciated, and we should all be respected and really getting our team to recognize that if we're here to serve and make -- and help make our employees in the field more successful, that ultimately, the company and our customers will be more successful, and really channeling that energy in that way. We have a great operating model. We have a great process. We have great people. And if we can get people working better together, solving problems, helping us deliver better for our customers, I believe, and I think our team -- I know our team believes that we can have a better railroad and better performance overall on aspects of our business. So that's the real impetus around ONE CSX is bringing our team together, after all we've been through with the transformation of the operating model and COVID and labor negotiations and all these things to build from where we are and say, we're going to be one team working together, supporting each other, appreciating each other and delivering for our customers. And ultimately, that will deliver better performance financially for our business and for our shareholders. And it really starts internally -- if we're going to provide better service, we have to really engage with our employees to make that happen.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thanks for the response.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO. Your line is open.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you. Congratulations to both Jim and Joe on the role and the retirement. I want to ask a question about kind of seeing that's going on kind of all night on this call. I think there is, I believe agreement generally that rails can grow share across many markets because of cost, environmental benefits and so on.  But I think the issue has been in what we hear all way from shippers is not just the level of service, but the consistency of service over seasons over cycle. And I'm not sure coming out of this pandemic and some of these labor issues we've experienced in the last year was a approach that kind of different framework for the operation and kind of capacity going forward.  Is there kind of framework where you look at search capacity, maybe differently than you have in the past, or is there an opportunity maybe on labor agreement to change how availability of cruise is managed through those kind of times to kind of remove some of that volatility that we see in service, which I think has been probably a big hindrance to the growth in the past.\nJamie Boychuk: Well, I'll take this one, Fadi. I believe from \u2013 no. We're coming out of this stronger than we ever have and we're coming out of this learning lessons, okay? If we haven't learned lessons along the way, as an industry, it's not just CSX than we haven't been watching or listening to our customers and seeing what's going on out there.  So yes, is there opportunities with their union agreements, there absolutely is. Let's get past the ratification now before you get any comments. But as Joe mentioned, the relationships between our unions and as we continue to do things differently and improve those relationships, it's going to open up opportunity for us to retain employees like we haven't been able to before.  And provide possibly a schedule and Jim has talked about this a number of times, provide a better schedule for our employees. So when they come to work, they come to work with a smile on their face. They come to work rested, they come to work being that facing the face that delivers cars to our customers to the docs and they have a positive attitude and they're wanting to grow this company.  And believe me, our employees want us to grow. There is no question about it. They want us to give them the tools to grow and they want us to give them the opportunity to do that. So that's a big opportunity as we move forward. We are staffing up. We are staffing up to make sure that we can handle the demand that Kevin and his team brings forward to the operating team.  Kevin and I talk every single day. Weekly, we go through numbers together. Our teams are very close. We know where the opportunities are out there. A number of great announcements that have been made through Kevin and his team through some big wins on customers who are opening up facilities on us.  So going forward, over the next couple of years, those are great opportunities and we're going to make sure we're staffed up for that. We've got locomotives in storage. I've said that a number of times. I think when I took Joe into Waycross, he saw the number of locomotives we had in storage out there, it's a surprise. I like to call that the field of dreams and one day, maybe we'll have all those locomotives pulling freight and pulling tonnage out there. And if we get to that point, we know that we've really grown this company beyond where we think we can.  So we are continuing to prep ourselves to move great, I think I answered the question on what happens if there's a bit of a downturn in business, we're going to stay forward-looking and we're going to try to drive this opportunity like it's never been done before.  And if there is a softening, we're going to make sure that we are fully prepared no matter how it comes to provide that service to the customers like they've never seen before. And that's our goal. And you're right, that's the theme you've heard tonight. And I'm happy that you said that, that is a theme you've heard, because I believe all my colleagues and everyone around the -- the table here, we all believe the same thing.\nFadi Chamoun: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shankar with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shankar: Thank you. Good evening, everyone. A couple of quick ones. Joe, probably the last one, hopefully you'll have to do is still wearing your auto hat on, but can you just help share with us what do you think the future of auto as an end market is for the railroads, i.e., near-shoring production basis, when do you think the chip shortage eases, et cetera, et cetera, and kind of, how that industry, kind of, ramps up in the near-term and long-term? And as a follow-up, any commentary on I think the rails rejected BMW, kind of, asks in the labor contract and then like summer cycling these increases like your strike, kind of how does that eventually end up? Thank you.\nJoe Hinrichs: Okay. Thanks. I'll take the second one first, and then I'll talk about the autos. As Jamie mentioned, we're going to let the process play itself out. We have a lot of respect for our union leaders, and we've reached tentative agreements and they're in the ratification process. I think, Union Pacific talked a little bit about some of the issues with BMW ED this morning. And I think the opportunity here is for us to really just work together to let the process play out. I want to respect that process on the union labor side. On the auto side, I mean, there's a lot of things going on. I mean, there's been a number of significant investments announcements in --, especially the Southeast, many of which have been -- we've been a beneficiary of having a relationship with or having the rail access to, whether it's on EV batteries or whether it's on new manufacturing assembly plants. So I think, you'll continue to see obviously, with the government's health increased production for things that support electrification of the automotive industry, and we were well-positioned to take advantage of that, frankly, with how these are playing out. I'm not going to comment on the chip shortage, but you are hearing from the autos that production is picking up. We're seeing more opportunity to deliver more vehicles. So that's a good thing for us in the near-term. And we're watching what's happening on the demand side, but certainly, we're seeing increased opportunity to deliver more vehicles for our automotive customers here at CSX. And longer term, of course, there's significant investment going in electrification. And we're seeing, again, that opportunity to be a part of that as CSX has been a successful part of a number of these announcements. So that will continue, and we're excited to be a part of it. Thanks.\nRavi Shankar: Thank you.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks taking my question. Jim, congratulations and good luck. Hopefully, we can stay in to us down the road. Wanted to come back to you, Jamie, on the headcount. The guidance is we're going to continue to increase transportation head count or store service. Can you frame what your expectations are for how large you need to get the headcount to get the service levels where you want it to be? And as you think about adding those resources into next year, should we be expecting the training rooms to be as full in terms of the productivity drag that we're going to be trying to model out here.\nJamie Boychuk: Well, thank you for that one. I would say our target, as we said, at the end of this year, 7,000 active T&E. We are pushing up to 72 as we move forward. And look, we're doing locomotive engineered training. We don't want to get ourselves caught behind on that. We're still good for a number of years, but we want to take advantage of that. And the trickiest part of headcount on the railroad is getting the headcount in the red spot. And as market conditions change and as things move around out in the field, we're very fortunate that right now we have over 60 employees who have taken temporary transfers to areas where we're short right now, and we're hiring. And we're taking advantage of some of those areas where we do have excess employees. So I'm quite happy with where our numbers are heading. And let's see what that number looks like as we continue to move forward and see where our attrition rate continues to take us to. But yes, absolutely heading into next year, we will see our class sizes most likely start to decline to more normalized attrition rate. We're going to make sure that we keep up with attrition. We don't want to fall behind on that. And we mentioned that, that's an 8% to 10% depending on which area of the network as we continue to rightsize and rightsize in the right places. So yes, you will see our class sizes start to drop when we start hitting those numbers, and we feel quite confident that we're heading in the right direction with those numbers. I wish I had the headcount today that we need it, but it will take a little bit of time and we'll get there. But you will see those class sizes drop to normalize class sizes as we move forward. I appreciate the question.\nQ \u2013 David Vernon: And if I could just squeeze one little one in there at the end here. As you think about the attrition rates on the recent graduates, have you seen any -- or noticed any differences as a result of some of the changes that are coming in the contract, or are you seeing like maybe some of the labor stick around a little bit longer than maybe we saw earlier in the pandemic when you were trying to ramp up?\nA \u2013 Jamie Boychuk: Yeah. We're definitely seeing it change lately, and I would not necessarily put that to the contract at this point in time since it's still out for ratification. I think that is a hard work that our labor group has done and the great relationships that we're continuing to build with our union groups on changing pay scales. The pay scale where we went from a step scale of 80%. It takes over five years before we get to 100%. As soon as we started offering to our new hires that they would make the same money as the person sitting next to them in the cab, we definitely saw a change in our retention rate in a positive way. So we are doing things differently. And I think as we continue to make some of those changes and build those relationships, that's only going to get better as we move forward.\nQ \u2013 David Vernon: I appreciate you letting us squeeze in here. Thanks again.\nEnd of Q&A:\nOperator: I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Matthew Korn.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, operator, and thank you, everyone, for your interest in CSX. We look forward to speaking with you again on our next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Hinrichs",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our conference call. I'm excited to be here with you today on my first earnings call as President and CEO of CSX. The entire CSX leadership team is here with me this afternoon, and we appreciate the opportunity to discuss our strong third quarter results with you. Our whole team is very motivated to build on our current momentum, strengthen our key relationships, provide better service to our customers and deliver profitable growth for years to come. We will achieve this through our One CSX culture, which at its core means one team working together to serve all our key stakeholders. As Matthew mentioned, also joining us on tonight's call is Jim Foote, who as you all know, led this company through its remarkable -- remarkably successful transformation over these last five years. Jim cares deeply about this railroad and its employees, and he has already been a great resource during my first several weeks in this role. I'll be happy to have his invaluable advice in the months ahead, and I want to thank him for all the help you have given me personally as I get the privilege to follow him. Jim, on behalf of everyone here at CSX, thank you. Thanks, Jim. I promise you this team won't let you down. I am honored to be here on behalf of the entire CSX team. I've spent the last month traveling all across the network, visiting our facilities and meeting with our customers, our employees, union leaders, regulatory partners and government officials. At this point, I can tell you two things for certain. First, this is a fantastic railroad. Our people and our infrastructure are second to none and the principles of scheduled railroading that drive our successful resilient operating model are deeply embedded throughout the company. I knew that CSX was a very impressive place when I started did not appreciate how impressive it really is until I saw for myself how this team of skilled, dedicated men and women work together to move thousands of box cars and containers for our customers each and every day. Second, for as much as this company has achieved over its transformation during the last several years, there is still so much more that CSX can do. Rail is a low-cost freight solution. Rail is a freight solution with low emissions. Manufacturing investment in the United States is accelerating. We have great advantages in this market, and our customers should have every reason to ship more by CSX rail, but we have to focus our efforts to make this happen.  We have to make it easier for our customers to use our service. We have to provide better service to our customers. We have to engage with all of our employees, especially those out in the field serving our customers every day to ensure that we deliver the reliability that we promised.  And we have to challenge ourselves to nurture the kind of culture that fosters a nimble creative and market-leading company, while staying true to the operational discipline that makes this all possible. The concept of one CSX as one team working together to accomplish great things can be very powerful. We have to bring one CSX to life. We'll talk more about that in a few minutes.  But now let's turn to our presentation to review the financial highlights for the third quarter of 2022. CSX moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the third quarter and generated approximately $3.9 billion in revenue. Operating income increased 10% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, which include the effect of additional labor and fringe expense related to the tentative agreements reached with our unions last month.  Results this quarter also reflected lower real estate gains compared to last year. Earnings per share increased 21% to $0.52 a share. Our operating ratio for the quarter was 59.5%. Now let me turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for the details. All right. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with a review of our outlook as shown on slide 12. There is no change to our expectation for double-digit revenue and operating growth for the full year, excluding the effects of the Virginia real estate transaction. While there is uncertainty in the global economy, we feel confident in our ability to deliver on this guidance as we look over the remainder of this year. As we mentioned in our earlier remarks, we are pleased with the positive momentum in our service metrics. And we continue our hiring and training efforts to ensure that we have the resources needed to build on these trends and drive improved network fluidity. We remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders, as you saw over this past quarter. And finally, we reiterate our priority to building a unified cohesive culture of ONE CSX that will strengthen the relationships we have with our employees, customers and all other stakeholders. This is a great company. And working together, there is so much more that we can accomplish. And that's why I'm so excited to be here. Thank you all. I'll now turn it back to Matthew for Q&A. Okay. Thanks, Ken. Well, I think Jim highlighted a couple of things, but certainly, the labor side of the business experience in the automotive industry is certainly very applicable to our situation that we're in now, when you look at working through -- with our labor union partners, tenant agreements and ratification and working through those issues. But more importantly, I had the opportunity to be a customer for 20 years of the rail industry and have shared a lot of those experiences with our team and have challenged us to continue to look at things from a customer perspective to make sure that we are holding ourselves to a higher standard of service and accountability for our side of this relationship. And I'm really proud of the work that Jamie and the operations team are doing to really show improvement in that area. Jim mentioned that obviously, the auto industry is a complex business. And so is the rail industry, there's different types of complexities. But from my background experience, I think a lot of that's applicable. But I would step back for a second and say, at the end of the day, it's the workforce, it's the people here that serve our customers. And when we bring everybody together and align around our core objectives and around our opportunity to serve our customers better and work together better, we can create an even better CSX, and that's an opportunity for us to bring home and to bring to life and really excited to be a part of that. I'll let Kevin handle the second part. Thanks, Sean. And thanks, Scott. I think the way I'd like to describe it really is just on how we're looking at this is just to step back for a second I had the opportunity throughout the summer with all my conversations with Jim and the Board to really take -- to get educated on tailor railroading and get educated on CSX. So the way I like to describe is how we're looking at things is the five guiding principles of scale in are really around improved safety, improved customer service, control costs, improve your asset utilization and engage and then ultimately, value and evolve your employees. And so if you take a look at all five of those things, they're all very important. And so operating ratio is a big part of looking at controlling costs and your asset utilization and frankly, a number of other pieces that go in there. So clearly, that's a very important number for us and a very important part of our objectives. Improving safety, as Jamie talked about earlier, is really important and we'll never ever get away from that in this industry. The other two areas around our customers and employees are opportunities for us. So how do we leverage our strong operating model that we have here that Jim and the team have built over a number of years to continue to improve the service we provide our customers and the experience and the engagement our employees feel as part of one CSX team. Now how does that lead to growth?  I'll tell you a couple of ways. One, with the increased service performance and the manpower that we're putting on that increases our capacity, which we now can leverage to quickly provide for our customers. I've had the opportunity to reach out and have video calls with about eight of our largest customers over the last couple of weeks and almost every single one of them has told me directly to our CEO or COO of all those customers, they've all told me that when you deliver a better service and more reliable, predictable service, we want to do more business with you.  So, we'll have to chase growth by trying to do unnatural things. We need to continue to do the things we're doing, leverage our operating model to continue to deliver better service and with that increase the headcount and with that comes the opportunity to serve our customers better. And because we're a lower cost, because we're better for the environment because of all kinds of other reasons, there's opportunities for us to grow the business that way. And that's the way we look at the opportunity through better customer service through increased capacity through the manning, we have the opportunity to serve our customers and there's more opportunity for us there. Yes. Thanks. So this is Joe again. From my perspective, first of all be very clear, our goal is to leverage our strong operating model and our operating ratios to give ourselves some more capacity, to give that incremental volume opportunity that should be very complementary to our margin performance. So we should not have to chase share by degrading our margin. In fact, that would not be wise. It takes a lot of volume to make up for a point of margin. So to be clear, we're really focused, as you've heard over and over tonight about the opportunity to keep this momentum going and leverage our great operating model the team has put in place here to free up that capacity with the manpower to then allow for us to naturally provide more volume to our customers that they're asking for. And that's really what our focus is for the growth side.\nQ \u2013 Justin Long: Got it. Thank you. Thanks, Jim, and I thank you from the above of my heart, because I'm equally excited about the team we have here, and I'm blessed to be able to work with everyone that you put together, and it is a great team. On your question on ONE CSX, the initiative -- the culture initiative was rolled out before I got here by the team, which I really appreciate the attention and the focus on that. At the end of the day, if we're going to make more progress as in rail industry and then here at CSX, we have to have a better relationship with our union partners and with our workforce out in the field doing the work that creates the value for our customers every day. So really focusing our energy on CSX about being -- recognizing we're all part of one team. We're all valuable. We should all be appreciated, and we should all be respected and really getting our team to recognize that if we're here to serve and make -- and help make our employees in the field more successful, that ultimately, the company and our customers will be more successful, and really channeling that energy in that way. We have a great operating model. We have a great process. We have great people. And if we can get people working better together, solving problems, helping us deliver better for our customers, I believe, and I think our team -- I know our team believes that we can have a better railroad and better performance overall on aspects of our business. So that's the real impetus around ONE CSX is bringing our team together, after all we've been through with the transformation of the operating model and COVID and labor negotiations and all these things to build from where we are and say, we're going to be one team working together, supporting each other, appreciating each other and delivering for our customers. And ultimately, that will deliver better performance financially for our business and for our shareholders. And it really starts internally -- if we're going to provide better service, we have to really engage with our employees to make that happen. Okay. Thanks. I'll take the second one first, and then I'll talk about the autos. As Jamie mentioned, we're going to let the process play itself out. We have a lot of respect for our union leaders, and we've reached tentative agreements and they're in the ratification process.

Overall volumes were up 2% as modest volume growth in merchandise and intermodal more than offset a minor decline in coal. Merchandise revenue increased 14% on 1% higher volumes, driven by pricing that reflects rising cost inflation and higher fuel surcharge revenue. We saw strength in the automotive market, where revenues rose 31% on 13% higher volume. Semiconductor challenges continue to ease and we see significant finished vehicle inventory that needs to move. Ag and food was also a bright spot as improving cycle times, as well as stronger demand for grain, wheat and ethanol and resulted in revenue growth of 25% on 10% higher volume in the quarter. Fertilizers and metals and equipment both saw modest revenue growth despite volume declines in the quarter. Fertilizer shipments continue to be impacted by reduced phosphate shipments and production facility turnarounds. Lower metals and equipment shipments reflect volatile commodity pricing and mill maintenance outages. Intermodal revenue increased 19% on 2% higher volume, as yields remained strong and supported by high fuel prices. International shipments were partially offset by lower domestic volumes, which reflected tight equipment availability and softer truck market. Intermodal demand remained strong in the quarter, with the team continuing to collaborate with customers and identify new opportunities, including a new international service line that contributed to growth. Customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service product in a challenging market, as they seek lower cost and lower emission alternatives to truck. Coal revenue increased 36% on 2% lower volume as pricing continues to benefit from strong export benchmarks. Volumes remain limited in the quarter due to production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the export terminals and general manpower shortages, though our crew availability did show improvement into the end of the quarter. We were also able to reopen portions of our Curtis Bay Terminal in September, which provides additional volume opportunities as operations normalize. Demand remains strong and we see opportunities to move more volume as some of these constraints ease. Trucking revenue increased 26%, mainly due to strong core pricing and higher fuel recovery. Other revenue increased largely due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage fees. The strong sequential increase was driven by continued limited warehouse capacity at customer sites. Looking forward, there is obvious macroeconomic uncertainty as the Fed remains committed to raising rates and addressing high inflation. Given this backdrop, the team is highly focused on its efforts to drive strategic growth opportunities that target truck and expand CSX's addressable market. As you've seen, our select site program continues to facilitate new customer partnerships. Last month, a key emerging domestic lithium supplier for the EV and battery markets announced the construction of a $600 million refining and manufacturing facility on a CSX serve site in Tennessee. We also have several other potential projects in various stages of development. We continue to see customers investing in new projects across our network. We're also moving forward with efforts to facilitate ESG solutions for our customers. Before year end, we will be releasing an updated version of our carbon calculator that is integrated within our ShipCSX interface. This new calculator will enable customers to drive into much deeper detail and understand in real time, the environmental benefits that CSX Rail can provide. Finally, we are also encouraged that service performance is on an upward trend and we expect to turn this positive momentum into additional opportunities with customers. I will now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations. If I got your question right, on the chemical, you're asking about the chemical trucking quality and. Yes. I mean you have to remember when we were looking at this business, it's a high touch customers really care about product quality and the brand awareness that they have for quality is very, very high. This is not a business that are typically moves around. And so what you've seen is actually, they've done a great job of attracting some drivers this year. And so that's been -- I think they've done an excellent job versus the market there. And then Pricing has been very, very good and continues to remain that way. And so that's what we continue to see. It's a very, very different market. It's not -- people have to be highly trained, highly skilled to do that business, and they have a great workforce doing it. Yes. I think probably the gating factor as we get into next year, and we obviously are confident in resolving our labor issues as what can the producers actually produce. Coal mines are \u2013 have been undercapitalized, quite frankly, and now have a lot of money in there looking for equipment, reinvesting. And so, I anticipate it will get better. We also do have a mine coming online middle of next year that will help us and we have a number of them that are still ramping up.  So. production looks like it could be up next year, knock on wood. We probably would have said that last year at this time, too. So -- there's a lot of things that can happen as you \u2013 we mentioned previously on the call, we've had some mines that have struggled, but are coming out of that here recently into the fourth quarter. So optimistic on the production side. There's clearly a need when you look at the utility coal mines are the utilities that we serve, particularly in the South. They have a lot of inventories; they need to replenish and so we anticipate a lot more consistent deliveries over the next year to really replenish those levels and we continue to see the export market very, very strong and a lot of geopolitical risk out there in Europe and other areas where you probably didn't see as much demand a year ago, continue to have a lot of demand. So mind you want to serve that, it's profitable for them, and we anticipate to have the resources to be able to deliver going into next year.\nQ \u2013 Ben Nolan: Okay. I appreciate it. Is that sort of if you're just categorizing areas of the business, that's probably the one area that we're looking into next year, there's the best growth potential? How do you think of it that way?\nA \u2013 Kevin Boone: I think on the volume side, remember, we kind of moved with the commodity price on the international market. So depending on what that does, they're at very, very healthy levels today. A little bit down from the highs that we saw previously in the year, but that I think that will be the biggest factor as we look at overall coal revenue for the next year.\nQ \u2013 Ben Nolan: All right. I appreciate it. Thank you. Hey Tom, on the trucking environment and other things, I think what you have to remember is we don't really operate in the spot market when the truckers are getting 30%, 40% rate increases, that's not what was occurring on our end, and we have a lot of long-term agreements with customers that they understand. And the good news right now, we're seeing our customers get price, and they understand some of the cost pressures we're facing. And so we're having those constructive conversations with them. And I think the spreads maybe versus truck aren't as great as they were before, but you have fuel surcharge, which is very high right now, and we know that flows through the truck rates. And so there's still a very, very compelling value proposition for customers to shift from rail -- from truck to rail. And so, we're still leaning into that, and there's a lot of appetite that we continue to hear of companies wanting to do that and for the environmental reasons as well. Yeah. That was participating in the 30%, 40% rate increases, maybe that would be more of a risk, but that wasn't the reality of our business model. Why don't I touch on the first one, and maybe I'll hand it off to Jamie on the second part of that. Look, I think you're well aware, our network more than well over half of our business such as another network out there, another railroad. And so, it's important for the industry to work together to capture some of these opportunities we continue to talk about.  Clearly, there's a market like housing that are seeing slower signals. But there's other areas like coal and some of the ag products that we're seeing great signs there. And even if in some markets where there could be some slowdown, I think the magnitude of the slowdown is what would be a question for us because there's demand that we haven't been able to meet.  And quite frankly, a lot of our customers haven't been able to meet because of some of their labor issues, the demand that they see out there. So, it's just not all CSX. It's the whole supply chain catching up and we're one part of that. So, we're demand ultimately settles out, I think, is somewhat of a question, but we do see from a share perspective, and that's an important thing, a lot of opportunity to win wallet share with existing customers and we see a lot of new customers willing for maybe the first time coming to us and saying, well, how does rail work and how could we provide a service for us. And those are the things that we have to lean into as we go in and we have some uncertainty in the market, and I'll hand it over to Jamie. I guess, I'll take the coal one. I think you could expect -- we're hopeful that some volume step up given the network starting to get more fluidity and some of our producers starting to perform a little bit better. So at the margin, maybe a little bit of better to the benchmark prices. So those have come down. They're still very, very healthy, but that would also impact what we would see in the fourth quarter from an export coal RPU perspective. So a little bit down probably sequentially there, given that we're already a little bit into the quarter and those numbers are down from third quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. The favorable operating momentum, Jamie discussed was accompanied by strong revenue growth of 18% or $600 million, including gains across all markets. Operating income was up 10% to $1.6 billion as top line gains outpaced expense headwinds from higher fuel costs, inflation, and tentative union agreement impacts that I will discuss in more detail on the next slide. The operating ratio was 59.5%, which, as a reminder, includes roughly a 250 basis point ongoing impact from quality carriers. Interest and other expense was roughly flat as was income tax expense. The effective tax rate in the quarter was 21.9%, lower than our statutory rate as a result of a favorable state legislative change. As such, net earnings of $1.1 billion, was up 15%, with EPS up 21%. Now, let's take a closer look at expense on the next slide. Total third quarter expense increased $460 million versus the prior year. Fuel was up nearly $200 million, primarily due to higher prices. Inflation remains above historical levels with $82 million of inflation across labor PS&L [ph] and rents. Labor inflation alone was around $50 million, which reflects the proposed wage rate increase from the tentative union agreements. In addition, we recorded $42 million of out-of-period expenses related to adjusting union labor accruals for the tentative agreements. The most significant piece of this is the impact of the proposed union bonuses. When you think about labor expense going forward, the $42 million is a net catch-up and will not recur. The base labor per employee, excluding this impact is expected to be the new run rate for Q4 and into the first half of next year. Of course, comp per employee will also be impacted by seasonality mix and other factors, but the full impact of the tentative union agreement is now in our base labor costs. Next, Quality and Pan Am combined for $46 million of higher expense with the increase split about evenly between the two. Quality expenses correlate with higher revenues, while Pan Am reflects the first full quarter of CSX ownership. The Pan Am integration process is well underway, and we continue to receive positive customer indications around strong growth opportunities as we invest to increase the speed and reliability of the former Pan Am network. Real estate gains were $33 million less than prior year, with volume and all other expenses increasing $66 million. While operating fluidity improved through the quarter, our hiring focus remains, and we incurred approximately $40 million of incremental costs related to T&E training, higher locomotive count, additional intermodal terminal activity and other congestion-related items. Volume-related costs and higher depreciation represented the balance of the expense increase. We do expect some of the congestion related expenses to continue into the fourth quarter, but view these costs as the first efficiency opportunities to be realized as we achieved sustained improvements in network performance. Now, turning to cash flow on slide 11. Year-to-date, free cash flow before dividends is down nearly $30 million, but up approximately $120 million, when adjusting for after-tax cash proceeds from the Virginia transaction. This is despite close to $225 million of additional capital spend, as we continue investing for the health of our network to support the quality in Pan Am acquisitions and position for future growth. After funding all the capital needs of the business, shareholder distributions have exceeded $4.3 billion this year, including over $3.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $650 million of dividends. Additionally, we ended the quarter with a strong balance sheet, including $2.4 billion of cash and short-term investments. Looking forward, we expect to maintain our balanced opportunistic approach to returning excess cash to shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Scott, I'll start with the sort of modeling questions. In terms of other revenue, what we've said for a while here is that we do expect it to normalize as supply chains get back to normal. Clearly, that didn't happen here in the third quarter with the increase that we saw in the other revenue line. But the expectation remains the same that we should see it come down in the fourth quarter and again into next year. To your other point around comp per employee. I think the best way to think about that is to take the $42 million we talked about, which was the out-of-period expenses related to the tentative Union agreement, strip that out of labor -- and that's the employee run rate that you're probably going to want to use going into Q4 as well as into the first half of next year before the next increase takes place in July of 2023. I'll let Joe take the second part of the question. Well, I mean, we're going to see how much cost we can take out based on how well the network spends. But I think the general premise that you're thinking about is the right construct, we got $40 million to $50 million a quarter this year that as we cycle better, should go away. Is there more opportunity beyond that? Sure. Tommy, I'll start on the Q4 OR question. So, I think typical seasonality, it's not always this way, but usually, it's a little bit worse from Q3 to Q4, and that's primarily because we start to wrap up some of our capital projects, and we've got some winter-related expenses that hit. So, all reason to believe that, that same dynamic would occur this year. Some of the other things that will impact the operating ratio going from Q3 to Q4, fuel was a benefit here in the third quarter because of the positive lag that we had. If fuel prices stay relatively constant or follow the forward curve, we would expect that fuel is going to be a bit of a sequential headwind to the OR. It could be 100 basis points or more based on where the forward curve is right now. So that's just a little bit of noise. Beyond that, hopefully, we're able to pick up some volume as the network starts spinning, take some costs out. So those are good things. And then I think it's a matter of what do we see on the intermodal storage side because that can be a bit of a swing factor for us as we sit right now. So on your comp per employee question, yeah, the math is right, and it really is just the inflationary impact over and above the settlement. So, I get to right around $2,000 per employee for that -- for the $50 million, a little bit more than that. The small mix impact from having more drivers at quality, which is a little bit lower comp per employee than a railroad worker, but that's really the only offset. No."

As I have said on every earnings call since I took over as CEO five years ago, I am incredibly proud of every CSX employee who has been by my side as we transformed this organization into the best railroad in North America, a company that's safer, more efficient, more profitable and far more successful than when we started. I have the utmost confidence that Joe and this team will take this organization to even higher levels of success. This transition process has been underway for a long time. It was critically important that the Board and I ensure that a succession plan was in place when the right time came. Having seen CSX through the initial phases of our transformation, pass some unusual, to say the least, challenges. And now with our operating performance starting to get back to normal, it's the right time for me to step away. Joe is a great guy. He is very talented, and he brings a tremendous amount of operations experience in running a large, complicated industrial company. His years working with a diverse unionized workforce will clearly serve him very well. It's truly been an honor to serve as President and CEO of CSX, and I wish all of you and everyone connected to this railroad the best. And now back to Joe. Well, sure. I've just taken a little nap here. That's okay. The biggest success is what you're listening to today in this room. Five years ago, there wasn't an executive team, it was me. These guys are all in new roles, all doing a phenomenal, phenomenal job. I said and oftentimes everybody our owners agree is the best railroad tenor. This is the best management team in the railroad business, and it's the thing that puts a big smile on my face, especially today when I'm getting out of here."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q2 2022 CSX Corporation Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Mr. Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter call. Joining me on today's call are Jim Foote, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, our Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on slide two, followed by our non-GAAP disclosures. And with that, it will be my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote.\nJim Foote: Thank you, Matthew and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll start by expressing my thanks to all CSX's employees for their hard work during another quarter of tough operating conditions. And I am very pleased to welcome everyone from Pan Am who joined the CSX team in June. We look forward to working together to build new single-line service across our combined network. Our second quarter results were solid as we continue to benefit from strong customer demand and firm pricing. But our ability to hire and retain new workers, which is vital to improving our service and growing the business, remains challenged. We are not alone in facing this problem. The labor market is tight, prospective recruits have many job options and the pandemic has had a profound effect on employees' work and lifestyle preferences. Our truck hiring process has been steady, but slow. We will not let up in our efforts to grow our engineer and conductor headcount and improve network fluidity to pre-pandemic levels. Since the time of our last earnings call, our uncertainty and volatility have clearly increased in the financial markets and in parts of the economy. Inflationary pressures have moved higher and interest rates have risen. We're staying diligent by keeping in close touch with our customers, monitoring our order rates, and constantly updating our forecasts. But what remains constant is that right now, as we have seen this entire year, there is more demand for rail service than what we are able to satisfy. The efforts we are making now to grow our workforce and add capacity to our network are not just a status by current demand. We are investing because we see plentiful long-term opportunities for rail, driven by customer demand for more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly transportation options, and growth in domestic manufacturing. We're excited about our potential, but to realize it, we must focus on near-term execution. Our entire team is aligned in our goals and I look forward to keeping you updated in our progress in the quarters ahead. Turning to our presentation. Let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the quarter and generated over $3.8 billion in revenue. Operating income was $1.7 billion, which includes a $122 million gain from our Virginia real estates sale. Recall that in the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a much larger $349 million gain from this transaction. Earnings per share increased 4% to $0.54 a share, which also includes a smaller contribution from the Virginia sale compared to a year ago. And our operating ratio was 55.4%, which includes a 320 basis point tailwind from the Virginia real estate gain but also includes combined headwinds of roughly 450 basis points from the impact of quality carriers, higher fuel prices and Pan Am acquisition costs. I'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jim. Turning to Slide 5. Second quarter revenue increased 28% year-over-year with revenue growth across merchandise, coal and intermodal. Overall volumes were flat, where we saw strong demand across many of our markets, limited by resource constraints across the supply chain. Merchandise revenue increased 10% on flat volume, driven by price and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Looking at some of the highlights. We are encouraged by strength in automotive market, where revenues rose 24% on a 10% increase in volume. There are clear signs from auto manufacturers that semiconductor challenges are easing. Our minerals business benefited from improved shipments of aggregates in salt. Our ag and food segment saw growth from ethanol and export drains. Less favorable was our fertilizer business, where volumes and revenues declined year-over-year on reduced phosphate shipments. Volatile fertilizer prices, combined with some production issues, impacted volumes in the quarter. Forest products along with metals and equipment saw positive revenue growth, offset by modest declines in volumes, mainly driven by resource constraints. Intermodal revenue increased 18% on 1% higher volume as growth in the international business was partially offset by lower domestic shipments, driven by continued equipment challenges through the quarter. Intermodal demand remains strong and customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service product in a challenged market. Coal revenue increased 54% on 3% lower volume. As we have discussed, coal demand remains strong across our domestic and international markets. Volumes have been constrained by production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the port, including Curtis Bay and general man power shortages, including crews. We still expect volumes to improve through the year as some of these constraints moderate. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage. Although macro uncertainty is clearly elevated as we enter into the second half, we still see positive drivers favoring rail, including environmental benefits as customers prioritize ESG, lack of truck capacity with driver shortages, onshoring of industrial production and inflation that will all benefit our growth opportunities. Currently, we are still seeing demand in many markets limited by the global shortage of labor. We believe this will continue to benefit rail's value proposition and the opportunity to increase mobile share over time. Going forward, we remain committed to making the investments needed to serve our customers and helping them grow their business. Let me now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations.\nJamie Boychuk: Thanks, Kevin. Safety remains our top priority at CSX, and operating safely is a critical foundation to achieving any of our operating goals. We work hard to instill a culture of safety across our railroad, and this begins with the moment that our employees enter our training facility. We focus not only on teaching employees the right way to work, but creating an environment that facilitates ongoing coaching and education our safety protocols. This is particularly important for the almost 700 new T&E employees that have completed training year-to-date. The coaching does not end with the training program. We have created new programs to significantly increase touch points with managers to ensure new employees are protecting both themselves and their fellow railroads. These efforts have helped drive another strong quarter of safety results. In the second quarter, injury rate increased modestly from the near record levels in the first quarter but remained flat year-over-year. Train accidents ticked up slightly in the prior quarter, but continued their positive trend as we focused on minimizing human factor accidents through proactive employee communications. Turning to slide 7. We remain committed to delivering strong service and we are taking action to improve network performance. We are seeing signs of this improved performance in our local service measures. This is our second consecutive quarter of improved results, and our best since exiting the pandemic downturn in 2020. We continue to actively coordinate with customers to further improve these metrics and are encouraged that we are seeing some of the largest improvement in some of the areas that were most challenged entering the year. Our intermodal trip plan performance remained strong and crossed back above the 90% threshold this quarter. Looking forward, we continue to focus on keeping terminals open and fluid during the ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect merchandise performance to improve throughout the second half of the year as network fluidity increases. To offset the impact of crew shortages, we have added additional assets to the network to better meet our customer commitments. As employees mark up, we will be able to refine the network plan to reduce congestion, shorten transit times and improve reliability. Now turning to slide 8 and our ongoing hiring initiatives. We continue to have a strong hiring pipeline that averaged over 500 trainees in the second quarter. This pipeline will allow us to continue filling classes as we work towards our headcount targets. For the second consecutive quarter, over 300 conductors qualified and total active T&E increased to nearly 6,700 employees. We expect this number to increase sequentially throughout the second half as our newly qualified more than offset attrition. In addition to focusing on hiring, we are also working to minimize attrition. These initiatives will help us with our new hires throughout the early years of their career, including a recent agreement that will lift the pay for newly qualified conductors. As I said last quarter, this will all take time, but we know that to deliver our service we must have the right level of resources and that starts with our people. I'll now hand over to Sean to review our financial results.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. In the face of these challenging labor market conditions as well as ongoing supply chain issues, CSX delivered over $800 million in revenue growth with gains across all major markets. Expenses were also up over $800 million and as a result, reported operating income increased 1%. However, as I will explain in more detail on the next slide, costs were heavily impacted by lower real estate gains, the addition of Quality Carriers, and transaction costs and higher fuel. Interest expense was $10 million favorable to the prior year, while other income improved $6 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4%. Turning to the next slide. Total costs increased $813 million. Nearly $500 million of the higher expense was due to the inclusion of Quality Carriers, lower gains on property dispositions, and Pan Am acquisition costs. Real estate gains were driven by the Virginia transaction, with a $122 million impact this quarter versus $349 million in the prior year. This represents our last significant gain from Virginia and we expect to receive the remaining $125 million of cash proceeds in the fourth quarter. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor with fuel expense up over $200 million, excluding the Quality impact. Not surprisingly, inflation is running above historical levels. And the $56 million on this slide represents inflation across labor, purchased services, and rents. All other expenses increased by $50 million, with approximately $20 million higher depreciation, about $10 million lower incentive compensation expense, and nearly $40 million of higher operating costs. This $40 million reflects increased hiring and retention, the impact of a larger active locomotive fleet, intermodal terminal costs from supply chain disruptions, and slower car cycle times. As service levels normalize in the coming quarters, we would expect the opportunity set on the expense side to come first from these operating categories. Now, turning to cash flow on slide 11. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow before dividends is down by approximately $125 million, but up about $75 million when adjusting for proceeds from the Virginia transaction in the prior year. Capital spending is up nearly $6 0 million and for the full year, we still expect to invest approximately $2 billion in our network. This ensures safety and reliability with roughly 8 0% of these investments going to the core infrastructure and a growing amount being allocated to strategic and return-based projects. After fully funding capital demands, year-to-date shareholder returns have exceeded $2.9 billion, including over $2.5 billion in buybacks and over $400 million in dividends. This brings our cash and short-term investment balance down to a more normalized $800 million. And as we go forward, we will remain both balanced and opportunistic in our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJim Foote: Great. Thanks, Sean. Let's conclude on Slide 12 with our outlook for the year. Having benefited from high export coal prices over the first half of the year and with fuel prices still elevated, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth for the full year. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer demand for rail freight remains greater than what we're currently able to supply. Export coal benchmarks have moderated over the last couple of months, but our guidance had already anticipated a correction over the second half of the year. Consistent with our commentary all year, we believe that increasing our train and engine employee headcount is the key factor necessary for improved service and network performance and our hiring efforts will continue. Our aim is still to reach an active transportation headcount of 7,000 as soon as possible. As Sean said, full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged, as is our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders. As we stressed last quarter, we are moving forward, but real progress takes time and is often challenging and gradual. There is plenty left to do, but the whole CSX family is committed to delivering on our goals, supporting our customers and growing this company. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Matthew.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Jim. Now as we start Q&A, in the interest of time, I\u2019d ask that everyone, please limit yourselves to one and just one question. And with that, operator, we will now take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So if I look, headcount's down sequentially, excluding Pan Am. And you guys were the first rail to talk about ramping up hiring, but perhaps maybe struggling the most. Curious, why do you think that is? And then maybe just separately for Kevin, any thoughts on just guidance on other revenue and coal RPU in the third quarter? Thank you.\nJim Foote: Well, hi, Scott, I'll take the first part of your question about the hiring. And yes. I don't know if we're struggling more than everybody else or not, I think everybody is struggling. We've hired over the last two years since we started talking about this issue, which we saw coming again a couple of years ago, 2,000 employees and our numbers haven't gone backwards. So the question has been not really as much as our ability to -- with employees into the pipeline and get them through the process, but a much, much higher attrition rate than we had expected from our current workforce. And a significantly higher attrition rate from the new people that we brought on. Unfortunately, after we get them through the classroom training part and the on-the-job training part and they actually go to work in the outdoor operating environment, we've seen a significantly higher attrition rate than what we had ever normally experienced or than what we had anticipated. So I think as we -- a couple of us, Jamie and myself, Sean mentioned during here, we've done a lot of work in terms of focusing on attrition now in terms of what we can do from a compensation standpoint to make sure that we keep the employees that we invest in. And so I think that is the -- I think that's the issue. I also what I said was we had a target out there of 7,000 people. And based upon where we stand today with the number of people that should be qualifying over the next two to three months, we certainly hope when we put that target out there, our employee -- number of employees off at that time was around 20 or so daily with COVID, it's now north of 80 to 90. So we hope that number comes down. And if those two factors come through as we expect and as we plan, we'll hit that 7,000 number. It's achievable by the end of the third quarter.\nKevin Boone: Yes. And then on the coal RPU, look, obviously, the met coal prices have come down, as everybody has seen. Our expectation right now, given where things are, is probably you'll look at the RPU in line with what we saw in the first quarter, so a little bit down from the second quarter. And then on the other revenue line, supplemental other revenue, probably something flattish versus this quarter outside of the market changing dramatically, which we don't see right now.\nScott Group: Thank you guys. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my question. Sean, there's obviously some uncertainty as to what the actual union wage increases from 2024 will ultimately be. Can you talk about how CSX has managed that uncertainty with its accruals so far? And if the actual wage increases were to come in different than your expectations, when do you true that up retroactively communicated prospectively? Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Bascome, I can speak to that. So when we look at the union wage issue, we have been accruing for increased wages ever since the expiration of the last contract. When we do get to a settlement, we'll take a look back at that and see if an adjustment is necessary. If it is, we would take that all at once. And it's probably also worth noting that we've been accruing four back wages, which means that when we do get to a settlement, the employees who've been working with us for several years and not getting wage increases will likely get backpay. So there will be a cash impact around the time of whenever that settlement occurs.\nBascome Majors: In that accrual in this period where we don't have certainty, has that been consistent with historic rail inflation or different reflecting the environment we're in today?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Bascome. I'm not at liberty to give any specific insight in terms of what we, CSX, are accruing. That's sort of based on our best guess of where the negotiations come out.\nBascome Majors: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes, good afternoon. I guess I want to go back to the headcount question a little bit in the network operation. You have made some progress on active T&E headcount and yet at the same time, it seems like the velocity metrics really haven't necessarily reflected that. So, I was wondering if you could offer thoughts maybe why that would be the case. And then also just like level of confidence that 7,000 is the right number. Is that pretty good visibility? I mean you talked about end of third quarter, if you achieve that, should we expect to see stronger volume and just a lot of confidence that, that's really the right number and you don't need to go beyond that. Thank you.\nJamie Boychuk: Thanks Tom. I'll first touch on our number. We feel quite comfortable that 7,000 gets us to a pre-pandemic level, which is where we were, but that doesn't mean we're stopping at 7,000. We're going to continue to hire, obviously, for growth that Kevin had mentioned that is still out there that is untapped really. So, 7,000 is a number that we feel comfortable that gets us to our metrics and our trains -- less train delay and everything else that's going out on the mainline and other locations. So, we're comfortable with that number for that reason, but we're not stopping there. I want to make that clear. We still got to make sure that we continue to hire for the anticipated growth over the next year or two. With respect to the numbers, you're right; we have seen an increase in our T&E quarter-over-quarter, if I look at my averages. And look at every week, we've got 20 to 30 folks who are qualifying in the conductor ranks, which in different areas is making a difference for us and helping us. But the last few months have really been a high peak for vacation for us. So, seasonably, our availability for our employees are usually 84%, 85%, but over the past couple of months, because of the seasonality of vacation, our availability really has dropped about 80% to 81%. So, every one percentage point equals somewhere close to 70 employees. So, if you start backing that out and thinking about what that means for the network, we're all feeling that vacation crunch, and we're going to be into that until probably Labor Day into September when the vacations start to back off. So, that's part of the reason why you're seeing numbers climbing, but yet our velocity and other areas of our railroad aren't seeing the benefits of it.\nJim Foote: Tom, it's Jim, too. And we've learned a lot over the last 18 months in terms about -- what the current state of affairs are when it comes to hiring and the difficulties associated with that, which were not fair historically. And so there's a lot of -- at the end of this quarter, are we going to know what our attrition -- what our true long-term attrition rates are going to be, where we know -- are we going to be in a situation where we get hit with another surge of some variants, and we have another couple of hundred employees off at any given time. So, we're trying to get back to the number that we put out publicly is what we had in 2019 when the -- end of 2019, early 2020 when the railroad is really running at a record performance. And so that's -- it's kind of a starting point for us to have better visibility as to what we should really do going forward.\nTom Wadewitz: Great. Thanks for the perspective.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys. Thanks for the time. So the last two quarters, you've been running whatever, high single-digits in -- of employees and training relative to your active T&E account. I'm just wondering, after we get past this more employees would be better than fewer, what's the right number do you think long term to be thinking about in terms of employees and training relative to the active headcount? I'm just assuming that you're incurring some additional expense for having a much of the 7.5% of your active T&E account on the payroll, but not necessarily haul and freight. I was just trying to figure out how the best way to normalize that. So any thoughts on that, Sean, would be really helpful.\nJim Foote: David, let me answer that. It's kind of confused to what I just said a few moments ago. We're going to have to learn our way through this as we get into the end of this year and beginning of next year to have a better understanding of what these attrition rates are. It's been somewhat of a surprise to all of us, the number of people that have dropped out after again, going through all of the classroom training, all of the on-the-job training and then working a few months and deciding that they don't like railroading as a profession. And so these are all new things for us. So one thing we know, we can easily manage down just simply by taking advantage of attrition if that's what's necessary. What we do know it's a lot more -- what we have experienced anyway in the recent times here, it's a lot more difficult for us to manage up. So in the short term, we're going to learn about what we need to do differently and how we need to do it. And until that point in time, we're going to do everything we can to not run short.\nDavid Vernon: Okay. So I get that it's probably too early to figure out what that number should settle at. But I guess if you think about kind of the -- what you're hearing from the folks that are bouncing out pretty quickly, is there some qualitative sort of assessment that you can share with us in terms of the rationale for why some of these folks are leaving what has historically been a pretty attractive job?\nJim Foote: Well, we're trying to do analysis of every different type to try and figure out why, so we don't make the -- so if we can identify factors we don't bring people in because there's a lot of cost and time and effort associated with training somebody. So we're trying to -- we're trying to do a psychological union at whatever analytics we can do to try and help us better -- have a better understanding of the profile of worker that we need to hire upfront. And this is just new for us and -- but we're learning and we'll get it figured out, and then we'll be able to better manage on a more consistent basis, the headcount.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thanks very much for your time.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citi. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe could you help us a little bit with your expectations around volume in the second half of the year and sort of how you think that, that might play out? And then, I guess, maybe a little bit bigger picture. I think there's just a general sense that there's more demand out there than you guys are able to capture. So as you see operating performance and headcount improve, there's the ability to sort of lean into that. Can you sort of help us with your confidence around demand levels in the back half, what you're hearing from the customer? Are you seeing anything slow down? So just kind of curious about, generally speaking, the volume and demand dynamics as you go into the back half of the year?\nKevin Boone: Hey Chris, this is Kevin. As I mentioned and Jim mentioned it, I think, a couple of times, demand continues to outstrip supply chain. We're not alone. It's the supply chain in general, and we're part of that supply chain with the crew issue that we're having. Right now, if you look at the back half of the year, when you look on just a purely comp basis, we have easy comps on the auto business, and we clearly have seen that production start to pick up the here. So we're encouraged on what's happening there. We've had some disruption on the coal side of the business. So we think that will continue to improve in the back half of the year. So there are some things that just from a comparison point of view get better as we move into the back half of the year. And then as the crews come online, we'll go and get -- chase those opportunities that we know are out there in terms of market share and then the existing opportunities that we know that are out there in terms of order fill rates, things like that, that we're highly focused on as a team and see the opportunity going forward. So nothing has really changed from the last quarter when we see a pretty robust environment, but we're not -- we're also keeping an eye on what's going on. Clearly, the housing markets had some pressure out there, but we have exposure there, but there's other areas where, quite frankly, there's a lot of inventory restocking that still needs to happen.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. So if operations get better, then the volume goes up, I think as simple as that as far as you guys are concerned, right?\nKevin Boone: Yes, that's our view, given the demand environment that we're seeing right now.\nChris Wetherbee: Got it. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAri Rosa: Hey good afternoon guys, and congrats on a solid result here. Jim, I was hoping I could just get your reaction to the announcement of a presidential emergency board in relation to the negotiations with the union. Do you see any risk around your ability to achieve margin targets based on that appointment or based on these negotiations? And alternatively, do you think that maybe some of these attrition issues could be solved if there's a resolution to some of these labor negotiations stand still that you've been facing?\nJim Foote: Well, we're glad that the emergency board was appointed. It's unfortunately, as I've said quite often, that it took so long to -- for us to get to this point. But the wall has worked for a long, long time, and we're hopeful that the emergency board puts out a recommendation, it's a win-win for both sides. Do we hope that once the labor issue is resolved -- and our employees are not happy that they didn't get a raise for 2.5 years, let me tell you that. They tell me that all the time. And so we're hopeful that once this is resolved, and we're expecting that they'll get a very better rate is that that will help with morale and that might help with the retention. And then final, the Board are seasoned veterans of dealing with labor issues and they are going to make a recommendation based upon the inputs and hearing from both sides. And as I said, I hope it comes out that it's a reasonable win-win solution. And if that's the case, we're certainly able to accommodate that in our economics going forward.\nAri Rosa: Understood. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Jamie, when we look at the weekly metrics, obviously, we've already addressed we're moving in the wrong direction, yet your intermodal trip plan performance back to 90%. Your volumes, which I'm sure you're disappointed with, but probably not as bad as some others or maybe what the metrics would be indicating. Can you speak a little bit to that apparent disconnect where velocity dwell moving one way, volumes kind of rebounding in other? And if you get to that velocity dwell that you're targeting with the right resources, how much free capacity that would free up for your network?\nJamie Boychuk: Yes, Jon, look, it's a great question. It comes down to the hard work of those operating folks on the ground, right from the union folks who are working, Dan and Dale, for us that are working more than they ever have filling in some of those gaps. But the operating team is just doing a fantastic job from the network side to the guys out in the field, making tough decisions. And in this environment, look at intermodal has a priority on our railroad. We make sure that the intermodal trains get across within their schedule for the best that we can. We're in an environment where we have concerns to make sure that chickens get fed and then the utility and the lights stay on. So, there's times when we actually have to prioritize some of our bulk traffic, which we would never have done before because normally bulk traffic goes to a stockpile. So, when you are prioritizing different flows of traffic that you never really had before, it goes against a little bit of your principles of making sure you take care of that merchandise traffic. At times the merchandise traffic might take a 24-hour delay or something across the network getting from terminal-to-terminal. So, that's where you're seeing some of those areas where we're just not moving as quick as we could and some of the congestion that's out there. So, yes, you're absolutely right that when we can get back to a little bit normalized workforce with respect to being able to move every train and not having to make those tough decisions on this week. We're worried about the lights in the Southern Carolina area or we're worried about the chickens down in Alabama or different areas, yes, you're going to start to see that flow move better and the capacity. Back in 2019, we talked about it a lot. We have a lot of capacity on this network. We have a great network. We have more than enough assets out there. As a matter of fact, I've always said and I stand by it, that hiring the folks that we are and any expenses that come along with that, we're going to be able to pull that out through assets. So, we're quite confident that we're making the right moves that we can today in order to try to keep everybody happy. But the one metric I did talk about is that the customer metric is, if you want to call it that first mile, last mile metric, which is something we're watching to continue to improve that we're showing up with the customers. They may get -- merchandise customers may have a 24-hour delay in transit time. But when we're actually showing up when we say we're going to be there and the cars we say we're going to bring in are coming in, that's making a difference to those customers, and that's something that we're continuing to work on to be able to give the customers a better experience than what they're feeling. So, don't -- the metrics that are out there, you're right. They're not the way we want them to be. I wouldn't be fooled completely by how you read into some of those metrics because we're running the railroad differently. And my final comment really on this is it's the hard-working folks who are out there running this operation are doing a fantastic job with the tools they have.\nJim Foote: Yes. This is Jim. Just a follow-up to what Jamie said, where the railroad is running in 2019, which was at record phenomenal rates in terms of reliability, velocity dwell, et cetera. At that point in time, we always kind of talked about the fact that without doing much to the rail network, we had an additional 25% to 30% of capacity available that we have freed up over the prior two years with the changes that we've made. And during the last 2.5 years, 2020, 2021, we did not slow down on our capital program. We continue to invest in the road. We continue to extend sidings, all because it just makes -- we're preparing for normalcy to return plus it creates a lot of efficiency across the network. So we're in great shape to handle whatever traffic comes to us whenever we get. We only have one restriction on us right now and it's crews, and we're doing everything we can possibly do to hire as many people as we can.\nJon Chappell: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks. I know previously, you had talked about volumes this year, outpacing GDP growth. I was curious if that's still your expectation. And Sean, last quarter, you gave some color on your expectations for operating expenses ex-fuel on a sequential basis. I was curious if you could do that again for the third quarter especially with Pan Am being layered in.\nKevin Boone: Hey, Justin, it's Kevin. Nothing has really changed with our outlook. Obviously, the GDP number is moving out around quite a bit, but that's -- a lot has changed since the beginning of the year. Clearly, inflation has moved up a lot more than what people believe coming into the year. And so we've -- that's probably been more reflected in price. And then on the volume side, probably not as quick of a recovery from a supply chain as we anticipated, but still given the favorable comp comparisons that we have in the back half of the year, we expect growth.\nSean Pelkey: And Justin, on the second part of the question around OpEx, I think it's fair to assume that OpEx is going to be fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. We will begin accruing for higher wages, the compounding impact of higher wages that would reset at mid-year. So you should see a little bit of an increase sequentially in the labor line. And to your Pan Am question, recognized on a fully integrated basis, it's about 1% of revenue or a little less than that. Figure the operating ratio on that business today is a little worse than our average and then spread the cost similar to our current spread, and that will probably get you there in terms of the Pan Am impact. But everything else relatively stable and the hope would be as crews continue to mark up and become available towards the latter part of next quarter as the vacation peak subsides, the network begins spinning, we begin to take some of those $40 million or so of costs out.\nJustin Long: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks, operator. Hi, everybody. Kevin, I just wanted to ask about yields in the back half of the year relative to where they were in the second quarter. There's a few puts and takes. I mean, obviously, fuel is moderating off of a very high level. So maybe that's a little bit of a debit to yield. Then we're, obviously, still in a high inflationary environment, so maybe there's some pricing opportunity. So I understand mix is going to be what it is. So if we can just kind of hold that to the side for a minute. Could you just talk about maybe how you think back half yields would be relative to what you did in the second quarter? And then, Sean, that was really helpful on the cost comment, non-fuel costs. I guess with fuel moderating, that optically releases some pressure on EOR. So would you kind of expect EOR to continue sliding down in the back half of the year? Obviously, not as big of a jump improvement from 1Q to 2Q. But would you expect the sliding down of OR in the back half of the year as well? Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Hey, on the yields, I think you covered one of them. Obviously, the fuel surcharge and there's a bit of a lag there as we move from second quarter and third quarter. So that can move around quite a bit, but you understand how that works and we'll adjust as that moves around a bit on the diesel prices. The other one that I covered earlier was really on the export coal pricing. What we're seeing today is obviously some moderation of the really, really high prices. The environment is still very, really good for us. We would take these price levels any day. It's just that they're coming off the stream level. So we'll see some moderation there. But outside of that, clearly, when we're having contract negotiations with our customers, they understand the high inflation environment we're dealing with today. And obviously, on the labor side and other parts of our business, and we're having to recapture that value in those discussions. So as things reprice, we're or making sure we stay in line with what's happening out there in the market and what we're having to pay expense-wise. So we probably would still see some underlying momentum there as well. But outside of that, nothing really changes into the back half of the year.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. And just adding to that, in terms of the operating ratio, I think the two things that are non-core or less inside our control, we had about $85 million in real estate gains last year. We're, obviously, always working on potential deals, but we'll see whether we have a similar number that materialize in the second half. And then fuel, if prices tail down and continue to go down, we'll have that favorable lag benefit that will help the OR. But if you set both of those items aside, we have sequential volumes gains into the second half of the year and expenses are relatively flat, excluding PanAm [ph] and the wage increase impact. And I think it would be fair to assume that we'll continue to have some good momentum on the margin side.\nAmit Mehrotra: Right. Okay. Very good. Thanks for the help. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to go back to the comments on -- Jim, I think you made a comment about offering a little bit more incentives or compensation for some of the folks that are coming on to the network? Or are there any other things you can do to break down that rate of attrition with other things, or you do have to wait on the official agreement to get settled? And where do you think that might be? And then for Jamie, are there any other things you would consider, we saw one of the Western rails put in embargo, which is pretty disruptive, but I seem to get them a little bit of relief. Is that something that you would consider at this point? Or would that be unnecessary?\nJim Foote: Well, we're working on a unionized environment, and we're not able to do too much without an agreement with the unions, including increasing their pay, but we have tried many options, and we'll continue to work -- to do whatever we can to try and change the working environment so that people feel -- like Dave, really want to work here, simple as that. And so it's an ongoing process like everything is. And so we don't have any silver bullets. We're making it up, but to a large degree, as we go along because these are all uncertain times and experiences that we've never had before, including myself, I've been doing this all my life. But we'll continue to innovate. We'll continue to come up with ideas and try to make this the place where everybody wants to work. In terms of embargoes, in my opinion, an embargo was a pretty draconian step that one would not take without a lot, a lot, a lot of forethought and so we would only do embargoes if it was absolutely, absolutely necessary. And that's my position on it and that's where we're going to stay.\nBrian Ossenbeck: And then timing of the labor resolution, do you have any ideas on that? Or is it still too early to tell?\nJim Foote: Timing in terms of the outcome of the current negotiations?\nBrian Ossenbeck: Yes.\nJim Foote: Sometime in the next -- that will be done in the next 60 days is like -- well, you're in the second -- you got three 30-day cooling off period. You got one has expired, one encompasses the period of time where the emergency board hears, meets and my belief is they are not going to delay that. So, they will be done in a little less than 30 days, 28 days or whatever time is left for that. And then after that, there's another 30-day cooling off period where the parties will meet to either accept the recommendations of the emergency board. And if history plays that shows us what the outcome will likely be, if the parties don't agree, the government has stepped in and impose findings on the parties. That will be done.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thank you, Jim. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon. I guess you've had a chance to have at least an early look at an assessment of quality and have a sense of how it's fitting in with your network? And my question, I guess, from an acquisition standpoint, strategically, do you think, Jim, you need more of that type of business? Are you impressed enough about by what you've seen with quality that you would ask for -- or you would look for more opportunities like that in the, call it, trucking space or the specialized trucking space? Or do you think with what you got with quality is enough and you're happy with what you have and focused on more organic opportunities going forward?\nJim Foote: Well, first of all, we're extremely impressed with Quality Carriers. They're a great company. They have great people. They do a great job. They're industry leaders, and that's what piqued our interest when they became available. But that's not the only reason that we pursued that. It was a fact that it aligned so well with our existing core business in the road and what comes first is our existing core business. So I don't see us necessarily going out and doing something along the lines of another quality of that size, unless it met those same criteria. And if it met those same criteria, then, of course, we'd be interested in it. But we're going to continue to try and expand our footprint through everything we've talked about on the trans flow and on the reloads and on the warehousing and everything we can do in those spaces that brings greater connectivity to the core rail network to our customers. So oftentimes, we don't go all the way to the door where there's a gap. And so whatever we can do to try and fill that gap between connecting the core railroad to a bigger base of customers, that's what intrigues us, and we'll continue to pursue that.\nWalter Spracklin: I appreciate that color, Jim. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Good evening. Jim and team, I guess, on-time performance down at 50% originations, 62% last seen since well before PSR rollout at CSX and I think even before Hunter got there in 2017. So you don't think that this starts to affect your ability to win business on to the railroad with the service levels here? And I guess, if, Kevin, you're talking about the demand is there and you're turning it away, maybe talk about where your -- is that localized your specific parts of the network where it's harder to hire where you're seeing some of that push away? And then, Jim, can you just clarify the lift. You mentioned lift pay for newly qualified conductors. But you just said you can't -- to Brian, you said you can't do things without the union agreement. Maybe you can just clarify what you meant by that statement then.\nJim Foote: Well, that means what I said. We obviously got a labor -- we obviously got the labor leadership to agree that we could pay the employees more. And so we couldn't just do that. I guess I would be concerned that we had slipped back to the points before to the metrics or operating performance metrics before we've done so much hard work over 2017, 2018 and 2019 in order to get this company running at spectacular rates. I find hard to believe that with our measurements that we are -- we're still doing an extremely good job under very difficult circumstances. It's clearly not like everybody else in the world is doing fantastic, and everybody is running at 100% on time and we're running at 62%. This is an issue that affects everybody in the logistics chain because it affects the truckers. This affects this kinship companies, this affects the terminal operators. This affects everybody. Everybody has slowed down, everybody is struggling and it's not just the railroad industry. As I was saying earlier today, I don't think Heathrow Airport ever thought they'd have to put an embargo because they can't handle air traffic through the facility. So it's a global phenomena. We're continuing to improve. As we said, we're continuing to do better. I can say one thing, we're the only railroad that I know of in North America that never shut a terminal down because we were congested so -- because we're intensely focused on the fact that everybody wanted to use e-commerce, and we were going to make sure we were there for the country when they needed us. So I'm very proud of the job this year that everybody did. So our other metrics, clearly, our velocity has stabilized. Our dwell has stabilized. We're beginning to turn the corner. I said, we're going to get to 60 -- 700 -- 7,000 employees when we said we would. And that's the plan, and that's what CSX is always done here in the last 4.5 years, and that's what we're going to do this time.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks Jim. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jason Seidl with Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I wanted to just clarify a little bit on the operating ratio. You talked about some of the puts and takes going forward. Obviously, the Pan Am costs aren't going to continue into the second half of the year. Just how much of that 450 basis point headwind was Pan Am in the quarter?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Jason, about 50 basis points was Pan Am.\nJason Seidl: Okay. Just 50 basis points for Pan Am. And then if I could just follow-up really quick. You talked about how much demand, sort of, pent-up demand for rail that there is. And then if we just assume that you do start improving even more on the operational side, is it really intermodal and maybe boxcar that a lot of these gains are going to jump out in terms of where you can open up and take on business?\nKevin Boone: I think it goes beyond just the intermodal and boxcar. You think about the coal network. And look, some of this is on the coal mines and some of the export facilities that have had a lot of issues as well. So it's -- we're part of that puzzle piece with the crew issue on that side of the business. But I would say it's a limited just the boxcar intermodal. When I think about some of the other markets like auto and we're playing a little bit of catch-up there as well. So there's opportunities across almost every market that we serve today.\nJason Seidl: Fair enough. Appreciate the time as always.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Ben Nolan with Stifel. Your line is open.\nBen Nolan: Yes, thanks. Hey guys. I had a sort of a big picture question. Just given all of the uncertainty with respect to the economy, as you guys have mentioned, if we do move into a little bit more of a challenging environment or a recession, do you think that the railroad is positioned any differently than it had been historically or not? And if so, how would that be?\nJim Foote: Big pictures. Everybody looks at me for that -- to answer that question. Well, I guess, by big picture, I mean, from an economy standpoint because I don't know what the next thing they can throw at us that we haven't seen in the last 2.5 years here. So I think the railroads are in CSX and the railroad industry in general is well-positioned right now with everything that's going on in terms of issues associated with congestion, issues associated with highway congestion, issues concerning the environment. More and more and more customers every single day are asking us about what it is we can do for them to help them with their ESG targets. My experience in the railroad business is when you -- if there is a bigger downturn or a downturn in the economy, to the extent that our service gets back to where the reliability we had pre pandemic. We're a great option for companies when they need to reduce their costs, and they need to reduce their transportation spend and people who are making decisions based on, I don't care what it costs to get it there, just get it there. And we're going to pay 25 times the historical average rate to move a container from A to B. What they want to do is save money, that's where our -- that's where we really get to play more in the game because we're always substantially cheaper than a truck. So, everything winds up for us to the -- but it's all based upon our ability given number of employees in here that we need so that we can prove to the customer that we're reliable. As Kevin just said, it's across the board. People that historically always move grain by rail or trucking it. People -- the supply chains are completely disrupted and to -- in some areas, completely dysfunctional. So, things will return to normal. We will get back to where we were, and we'll continue to grow share, principally by competing with and beginning to convert more and more traffic off the highway all the time.\nBen Nolan: All right. Appreciate it. Thanks for that.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Eric Morgan with Barclays. Your line is open.\nEric Morgan: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about capacity of the network outside labor. I think you talked about how much additional capacity has been freed up to PSR. And looking at things now, does that kind of still exist today? Or are there bottlenecks that you think need to be resolved with additional capital once your labor situation is on their footing?\nJamie Boychuk: No, Eric, it's purely labors what's -- people is what's holding us back. Our network is -- as if anything, our network has improved over the past three years. As you heard Jim, we put just as much tie rail and ballast and as we have. We've done siding extensions in areas we've invested. And we've got more locomotives than we need. We're really in a great spot if we had the folks that we need to move the business. So, our terminals, as a matter of fact, 90% of our home terminals are running very well. Our flat switching terminals are running well. Where we get congestion a little bit of bottleneck is different crew change points where we don't have crews to keep those trains moving and we got to make a decision on which train moves quicker than a different train. So, very confident that the network is better than probably what it was in 2019 and we're ready to go once we get the folks trained up.\nEric Morgan: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. Just sort of following up a little on the last operational related question. I mean you guys are -- seem to be pretty close or moving closer on the headcount front and the network, you say is in good shape. But -- and it's just a matter of getting those extra employees, but is there anything that needs to be done like reconfiguring schedules? I mean I know you mentioned you're making decisions on which trains to run? I mean is there any wider scale changes either the intermodal network, the carload network needed in addition to the employees? Or is it simply that? And then when you hit that 7,000 target, I mean how quickly does all this volume and service react? I mean it just doesn't seem that we're that far away. I'm just trying to understand how that gap in the service, how it reacts and how quickly to react. Thanks.\nJamie Boychuk: Jordan, it's -- where we're sitting right now with respect to our terminals and everything else, we are in much better shape than we have been in a long time. So we design -- we review and analyze the railroad every single day, every single week. As a matter of fact, I made an org change just a month ago or so that service design reports directly to me. So then I can work closer with them so we can continue to design things every day. When I say we make a decision, it's the unscheduled network of coal and grain that has become a much higher priority than it ever has been. And that unscheduled network is where those decisions come in with the crew availability. And of course, Kevin and I and our teams are working all the time to make sure that when there's a location that -- at a shortened rain and needs to feed chickens or anything else, we'll make sure we get it there. It's just on-time service and it never was before. The same thing with coal for the Southern utilities. This was all stockpile and it's turned into just on-time service. So that's changed for us, and it's very difficult for us to schedule unit trains, not knowing when they're going to be released to come out.\nJames Foote: Yes, Jordan, it's Jim, too. We're grinding here every day, and we're doing all of this with hand to mouth and trying to make sure that we serve every customer that we possibly can, the best we can. And yes, our velocity is down, our dwell is up but we still move more carloads in the second quarter of this year than we did in 2019 when we were running lights out. So it's not like, oh my god, what are these guys or velocity is down 21%. Their volumes must be down 21%. We're still moving more freight than we did. So yes, that's why we're confident that when we get volumes back to where we get the velocity back to where they were and things are -- and key from a customer standpoint is reliability. That's why velocity dwell, first mile, last mile, that's why these metrics are so important because this is what the customer looks at to determine whether or not they're going to ship by rail or truck. If we get that back, that's where we have a reasonably solid base to believe that the volumes will grow in the second half and continue to grow into the future. But we're moving more freight this quarter than we did in 2019.\nJordan Alliger: Yes. It's interesting on the unit train and just-in-time comment actually. I'm curious though, does that mean that there are issues separate from what you as a rail could do and more related to the customer on this whole just-in-time thing that that may make it a challenge or not?\nJim Foote: Well, Kevin might want to weigh in, but as I said, it's everybody in the supply chain when we're talking about moving coal trains from a mine to a utility or from a mine to an export terminal. It's not just the railroad. We need everybody in the supply chain to work, when you're talking about moving international boxes from a port to a warehouse on the south side of Chicago, we need the terminal to work, you need the railroad to work. You need the inland terminal to work, you need to have chassis there. You need to have packers there. You need to have somebody there that can unload the box when it gets to the warehouse and get it off the chassis and can get it back. There are billion moving parts, we play a role in that in many respects. And each one of those key elements in the supply chain is challenged. So we need to get better. Everybody needs to get better. And you get a sense, generally, the things are gradually improving. And again, you see that in every industry, that is not working properly because of the issues associated with the shortage of employees.\nJordan Alliger: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much and thanks for taking my question. Jim, I'd like to go big picture on you here. You talked about, okay, if we could just get to 7,000 and get our trains where we need to be, everything comes down quickly, we start running well. And then you said, well, it's not really that simple, right? Because we've got shippers that need to accommodate. We've got ports that need to accommodate. I guess my thought is if you had all the crew you needed tomorrow, or a year from now, right? You pick your target. How long would it take you to get the network running the way you want to run it? And then I guess, on the tail end of that, the worlds changed a lot in the last year. Has your thought about what kind of returns this business can generate changed at all as part of that macro?\nJim Foote: Big picture question. Thanks a lot, Jeff, following up with an easy one, soft ball. I might -- no. As I said before, I think the railroad industry is extremely well-positioned, not just for the short-term, for the long-term with everything that's going on in the world, globally, United States, you name it, reshoring, issues associated with this and the other thing, highway congestion, you name it. I think the railroad industry is extremely well-positioned to be a much more relevant and key player in the transportation network and shipment of customers' goods going forward. And so if we're more relevant, if we provide a better service in your -- a key component that should be good for our markets, not bad for our margins. We're in much more sought after product service as opposed to just a transportation commodity. So that is -- so that's good. Can I fix the global hunger? No. Can I solve the pandemic? No. Can I fix CSX and his team, do I have 100% confidence in the people that work for CSX to get this railroad back and running than what it was and then even better? Yes. So, I can't fix the chassis shortage problems. I can't fix -- I can't invest in coal mines. I can't move this. I can't move that. But that will all correct itself over time. And we will be a much bigger participant in that. And like I said, I think we've got a great future ahead of us.\nJeff Kauffman: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. Safety remains our top priority at CSX, and operating safely is a critical foundation to achieving any of our operating goals. We work hard to instill a culture of safety across our railroad, and this begins with the moment that our employees enter our training facility. We focus not only on teaching employees the right way to work, but creating an environment that facilitates ongoing coaching and education our safety protocols. This is particularly important for the almost 700 new T&E employees that have completed training year-to-date. The coaching does not end with the training program. We have created new programs to significantly increase touch points with managers to ensure new employees are protecting both themselves and their fellow railroads. These efforts have helped drive another strong quarter of safety results. In the second quarter, injury rate increased modestly from the near record levels in the first quarter but remained flat year-over-year. Train accidents ticked up slightly in the prior quarter, but continued their positive trend as we focused on minimizing human factor accidents through proactive employee communications. Turning to slide 7. We remain committed to delivering strong service and we are taking action to improve network performance. We are seeing signs of this improved performance in our local service measures. This is our second consecutive quarter of improved results, and our best since exiting the pandemic downturn in 2020. We continue to actively coordinate with customers to further improve these metrics and are encouraged that we are seeing some of the largest improvement in some of the areas that were most challenged entering the year. Our intermodal trip plan performance remained strong and crossed back above the 90% threshold this quarter. Looking forward, we continue to focus on keeping terminals open and fluid during the ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect merchandise performance to improve throughout the second half of the year as network fluidity increases. To offset the impact of crew shortages, we have added additional assets to the network to better meet our customer commitments. As employees mark up, we will be able to refine the network plan to reduce congestion, shorten transit times and improve reliability. Now turning to slide 8 and our ongoing hiring initiatives. We continue to have a strong hiring pipeline that averaged over 500 trainees in the second quarter. This pipeline will allow us to continue filling classes as we work towards our headcount targets. For the second consecutive quarter, over 300 conductors qualified and total active T&E increased to nearly 6,700 employees. We expect this number to increase sequentially throughout the second half as our newly qualified more than offset attrition. In addition to focusing on hiring, we are also working to minimize attrition. These initiatives will help us with our new hires throughout the early years of their career, including a recent agreement that will lift the pay for newly qualified conductors. As I said last quarter, this will all take time, but we know that to deliver our service we must have the right level of resources and that starts with our people. I'll now hand over to Sean to review our financial results. Thanks Tom. I'll first touch on our number. We feel quite comfortable that 7,000 gets us to a pre-pandemic level, which is where we were, but that doesn't mean we're stopping at 7,000. We're going to continue to hire, obviously, for growth that Kevin had mentioned that is still out there that is untapped really. So, 7,000 is a number that we feel comfortable that gets us to our metrics and our trains -- less train delay and everything else that's going out on the mainline and other locations. So, we're comfortable with that number for that reason, but we're not stopping there. I want to make that clear. We still got to make sure that we continue to hire for the anticipated growth over the next year or two. With respect to the numbers, you're right; we have seen an increase in our T&E quarter-over-quarter, if I look at my averages. And look at every week, we've got 20 to 30 folks who are qualifying in the conductor ranks, which in different areas is making a difference for us and helping us. But the last few months have really been a high peak for vacation for us. So, seasonably, our availability for our employees are usually 84%, 85%, but over the past couple of months, because of the seasonality of vacation, our availability really has dropped about 80% to 81%. So, every one percentage point equals somewhere close to 70 employees. So, if you start backing that out and thinking about what that means for the network, we're all feeling that vacation crunch, and we're going to be into that until probably Labor Day into September when the vacations start to back off. So, that's part of the reason why you're seeing numbers climbing, but yet our velocity and other areas of our railroad aren't seeing the benefits of it. Yes, Jon, look, it's a great question. It comes down to the hard work of those operating folks on the ground, right from the union folks who are working, Dan and Dale, for us that are working more than they ever have filling in some of those gaps. But the operating team is just doing a fantastic job from the network side to the guys out in the field, making tough decisions. And in this environment, look at intermodal has a priority on our railroad. We make sure that the intermodal trains get across within their schedule for the best that we can. We're in an environment where we have concerns to make sure that chickens get fed and then the utility and the lights stay on. So, there's times when we actually have to prioritize some of our bulk traffic, which we would never have done before because normally bulk traffic goes to a stockpile. So, when you are prioritizing different flows of traffic that you never really had before, it goes against a little bit of your principles of making sure you take care of that merchandise traffic. At times the merchandise traffic might take a 24-hour delay or something across the network getting from terminal-to-terminal. So, that's where you're seeing some of those areas where we're just not moving as quick as we could and some of the congestion that's out there. So, yes, you're absolutely right that when we can get back to a little bit normalized workforce with respect to being able to move every train and not having to make those tough decisions on this week. We're worried about the lights in the Southern Carolina area or we're worried about the chickens down in Alabama or different areas, yes, you're going to start to see that flow move better and the capacity. Back in 2019, we talked about it a lot. We have a lot of capacity on this network. We have a great network. We have more than enough assets out there. As a matter of fact, I've always said and I stand by it, that hiring the folks that we are and any expenses that come along with that, we're going to be able to pull that out through assets. So, we're quite confident that we're making the right moves that we can today in order to try to keep everybody happy. But the one metric I did talk about is that the customer metric is, if you want to call it that first mile, last mile metric, which is something we're watching to continue to improve that we're showing up with the customers. They may get -- merchandise customers may have a 24-hour delay in transit time. But when we're actually showing up when we say we're going to be there and the cars we say we're going to bring in are coming in, that's making a difference to those customers, and that's something that we're continuing to work on to be able to give the customers a better experience than what they're feeling. So, don't -- the metrics that are out there, you're right. They're not the way we want them to be. I wouldn't be fooled completely by how you read into some of those metrics because we're running the railroad differently. And my final comment really on this is it's the hard-working folks who are out there running this operation are doing a fantastic job with the tools they have. No, Eric, it's purely labors what's -- people is what's holding us back. Our network is -- as if anything, our network has improved over the past three years. As you heard Jim, we put just as much tie rail and ballast and as we have. We've done siding extensions in areas we've invested. And we've got more locomotives than we need. We're really in a great spot if we had the folks that we need to move the business. So, our terminals, as a matter of fact, 90% of our home terminals are running very well. Our flat switching terminals are running well. Where we get congestion a little bit of bottleneck is different crew change points where we don't have crews to keep those trains moving and we got to make a decision on which train moves quicker than a different train. So, very confident that the network is better than probably what it was in 2019 and we're ready to go once we get the folks trained up. Jordan, it's -- where we're sitting right now with respect to our terminals and everything else, we are in much better shape than we have been in a long time. So we design -- we review and analyze the railroad every single day, every single week. As a matter of fact, I made an org change just a month ago or so that service design reports directly to me. So then I can work closer with them so we can continue to design things every day. When I say we make a decision, it's the unscheduled network of coal and grain that has become a much higher priority than it ever has been. And that unscheduled network is where those decisions come in with the crew availability. And of course, Kevin and I and our teams are working all the time to make sure that when there's a location that -- at a shortened rain and needs to feed chickens or anything else, we'll make sure we get it there. It's just on-time service and it never was before. The same thing with coal for the Southern utilities. This was all stockpile and it's turned into just on-time service. So that's changed for us, and it's very difficult for us to schedule unit trains, not knowing when they're going to be released to come out."

            "name": "Jim Foote",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I'll start by expressing my thanks to all CSX's employees for their hard work during another quarter of tough operating conditions. And I am very pleased to welcome everyone from Pan Am who joined the CSX team in June. We look forward to working together to build new single-line service across our combined network. Our second quarter results were solid as we continue to benefit from strong customer demand and firm pricing. But our ability to hire and retain new workers, which is vital to improving our service and growing the business, remains challenged. We are not alone in facing this problem. The labor market is tight, prospective recruits have many job options and the pandemic has had a profound effect on employees' work and lifestyle preferences. Our truck hiring process has been steady, but slow. We will not let up in our efforts to grow our engineer and conductor headcount and improve network fluidity to pre-pandemic levels. Since the time of our last earnings call, our uncertainty and volatility have clearly increased in the financial markets and in parts of the economy. Inflationary pressures have moved higher and interest rates have risen. We're staying diligent by keeping in close touch with our customers, monitoring our order rates, and constantly updating our forecasts. But what remains constant is that right now, as we have seen this entire year, there is more demand for rail service than what we are able to satisfy. The efforts we are making now to grow our workforce and add capacity to our network are not just a status by current demand. We are investing because we see plentiful long-term opportunities for rail, driven by customer demand for more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly transportation options, and growth in domestic manufacturing. We're excited about our potential, but to realize it, we must focus on near-term execution. Our entire team is aligned in our goals and I look forward to keeping you updated in our progress in the quarters ahead. Turning to our presentation. Let's start with Slide 4, which highlights our second quarter key financial results. We moved nearly 1.6 million carloads in the quarter and generated over $3.8 billion in revenue. Operating income was $1.7 billion, which includes a $122 million gain from our Virginia real estates sale. Recall that in the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a much larger $349 million gain from this transaction. Earnings per share increased 4% to $0.54 a share, which also includes a smaller contribution from the Virginia sale compared to a year ago. And our operating ratio was 55.4%, which includes a 320 basis point tailwind from the Virginia real estate gain but also includes combined headwinds of roughly 450 basis points from the impact of quality carriers, higher fuel prices and Pan Am acquisition costs. I'll now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details. Great. Thanks, Sean. Let's conclude on Slide 12 with our outlook for the year. Having benefited from high export coal prices over the first half of the year and with fuel prices still elevated, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth for the full year. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our customer demand for rail freight remains greater than what we're currently able to supply. Export coal benchmarks have moderated over the last couple of months, but our guidance had already anticipated a correction over the second half of the year. Consistent with our commentary all year, we believe that increasing our train and engine employee headcount is the key factor necessary for improved service and network performance and our hiring efforts will continue. Our aim is still to reach an active transportation headcount of 7,000 as soon as possible. As Sean said, full year capital expenditures are planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged, as is our commitment to return excess capital to our shareholders. As we stressed last quarter, we are moving forward, but real progress takes time and is often challenging and gradual. There is plenty left to do, but the whole CSX family is committed to delivering on our goals, supporting our customers and growing this company. Thank you. And I'll turn it back to Matthew. Well, hi, Scott, I'll take the first part of your question about the hiring. And yes. I don't know if we're struggling more than everybody else or not, I think everybody is struggling. We've hired over the last two years since we started talking about this issue, which we saw coming again a couple of years ago, 2,000 employees and our numbers haven't gone backwards. So the question has been not really as much as our ability to -- with employees into the pipeline and get them through the process, but a much, much higher attrition rate than we had expected from our current workforce. And a significantly higher attrition rate from the new people that we brought on. Unfortunately, after we get them through the classroom training part and the on-the-job training part and they actually go to work in the outdoor operating environment, we've seen a significantly higher attrition rate than what we had ever normally experienced or than what we had anticipated. So I think as we -- a couple of us, Jamie and myself, Sean mentioned during here, we've done a lot of work in terms of focusing on attrition now in terms of what we can do from a compensation standpoint to make sure that we keep the employees that we invest in. And so I think that is the -- I think that's the issue. I also what I said was we had a target out there of 7,000 people. And based upon where we stand today with the number of people that should be qualifying over the next two to three months, we certainly hope when we put that target out there, our employee -- number of employees off at that time was around 20 or so daily with COVID, it's now north of 80 to 90. So we hope that number comes down. And if those two factors come through as we expect and as we plan, we'll hit that 7,000 number. It's achievable by the end of the third quarter. Tom, it's Jim, too. And we've learned a lot over the last 18 months in terms about -- what the current state of affairs are when it comes to hiring and the difficulties associated with that, which were not fair historically. And so there's a lot of -- at the end of this quarter, are we going to know what our attrition -- what our true long-term attrition rates are going to be, where we know -- are we going to be in a situation where we get hit with another surge of some variants, and we have another couple of hundred employees off at any given time. So, we're trying to get back to the number that we put out publicly is what we had in 2019 when the -- end of 2019, early 2020 when the railroad is really running at a record performance. And so that's -- it's kind of a starting point for us to have better visibility as to what we should really do going forward. David, let me answer that. It's kind of confused to what I just said a few moments ago. We're going to have to learn our way through this as we get into the end of this year and beginning of next year to have a better understanding of what these attrition rates are. It's been somewhat of a surprise to all of us, the number of people that have dropped out after again, going through all of the classroom training, all of the on-the-job training and then working a few months and deciding that they don't like railroading as a profession. And so these are all new things for us. So one thing we know, we can easily manage down just simply by taking advantage of attrition if that's what's necessary. What we do know it's a lot more -- what we have experienced anyway in the recent times here, it's a lot more difficult for us to manage up. So in the short term, we're going to learn about what we need to do differently and how we need to do it. And until that point in time, we're going to do everything we can to not run short. Well, we're trying to do analysis of every different type to try and figure out why, so we don't make the -- so if we can identify factors we don't bring people in because there's a lot of cost and time and effort associated with training somebody. So we're trying to -- we're trying to do a psychological union at whatever analytics we can do to try and help us better -- have a better understanding of the profile of worker that we need to hire upfront. And this is just new for us and -- but we're learning and we'll get it figured out, and then we'll be able to better manage on a more consistent basis, the headcount. Well, we're glad that the emergency board was appointed. It's unfortunately, as I've said quite often, that it took so long to -- for us to get to this point. But the wall has worked for a long, long time, and we're hopeful that the emergency board puts out a recommendation, it's a win-win for both sides. Do we hope that once the labor issue is resolved -- and our employees are not happy that they didn't get a raise for 2.5 years, let me tell you that. They tell me that all the time. And so we're hopeful that once this is resolved, and we're expecting that they'll get a very better rate is that that will help with morale and that might help with the retention. And then final, the Board are seasoned veterans of dealing with labor issues and they are going to make a recommendation based upon the inputs and hearing from both sides. And as I said, I hope it comes out that it's a reasonable win-win solution. And if that's the case, we're certainly able to accommodate that in our economics going forward. Yes. This is Jim. Just a follow-up to what Jamie said, where the railroad is running in 2019, which was at record phenomenal rates in terms of reliability, velocity dwell, et cetera. At that point in time, we always kind of talked about the fact that without doing much to the rail network, we had an additional 25% to 30% of capacity available that we have freed up over the prior two years with the changes that we've made. And during the last 2.5 years, 2020, 2021, we did not slow down on our capital program. We continue to invest in the road. We continue to extend sidings, all because it just makes -- we're preparing for normalcy to return plus it creates a lot of efficiency across the network. So we're in great shape to handle whatever traffic comes to us whenever we get. We only have one restriction on us right now and it's crews, and we're doing everything we can possibly do to hire as many people as we can. Well, we're working on a unionized environment, and we're not able to do too much without an agreement with the unions, including increasing their pay, but we have tried many options, and we'll continue to work -- to do whatever we can to try and change the working environment so that people feel -- like Dave, really want to work here, simple as that. And so it's an ongoing process like everything is. And so we don't have any silver bullets. We're making it up, but to a large degree, as we go along because these are all uncertain times and experiences that we've never had before, including myself, I've been doing this all my life. But we'll continue to innovate. We'll continue to come up with ideas and try to make this the place where everybody wants to work. In terms of embargoes, in my opinion, an embargo was a pretty draconian step that one would not take without a lot, a lot, a lot of forethought and so we would only do embargoes if it was absolutely, absolutely necessary. And that's my position on it and that's where we're going to stay. Timing in terms of the outcome of the current negotiations? Sometime in the next -- that will be done in the next 60 days is like -- well, you're in the second -- you got three 30-day cooling off period. You got one has expired, one encompasses the period of time where the emergency board hears, meets and my belief is they are not going to delay that. So, they will be done in a little less than 30 days, 28 days or whatever time is left for that. And then after that, there's another 30-day cooling off period where the parties will meet to either accept the recommendations of the emergency board. And if history plays that shows us what the outcome will likely be, if the parties don't agree, the government has stepped in and impose findings on the parties. That will be done. Well, first of all, we're extremely impressed with Quality Carriers. They're a great company. They have great people. They do a great job. They're industry leaders, and that's what piqued our interest when they became available. But that's not the only reason that we pursued that. It was a fact that it aligned so well with our existing core business in the road and what comes first is our existing core business. So I don't see us necessarily going out and doing something along the lines of another quality of that size, unless it met those same criteria. And if it met those same criteria, then, of course, we'd be interested in it. But we're going to continue to try and expand our footprint through everything we've talked about on the trans flow and on the reloads and on the warehousing and everything we can do in those spaces that brings greater connectivity to the core rail network to our customers. So oftentimes, we don't go all the way to the door where there's a gap. And so whatever we can do to try and fill that gap between connecting the core railroad to a bigger base of customers, that's what intrigues us, and we'll continue to pursue that. Well, that means what I said. We obviously got a labor -- we obviously got the labor leadership to agree that we could pay the employees more. And so we couldn't just do that. I guess I would be concerned that we had slipped back to the points before to the metrics or operating performance metrics before we've done so much hard work over 2017, 2018 and 2019 in order to get this company running at spectacular rates. I find hard to believe that with our measurements that we are -- we're still doing an extremely good job under very difficult circumstances. It's clearly not like everybody else in the world is doing fantastic, and everybody is running at 100% on time and we're running at 62%. This is an issue that affects everybody in the logistics chain because it affects the truckers. This affects this kinship companies, this affects the terminal operators. This affects everybody. Everybody has slowed down, everybody is struggling and it's not just the railroad industry. As I was saying earlier today, I don't think Heathrow Airport ever thought they'd have to put an embargo because they can't handle air traffic through the facility. So it's a global phenomena. We're continuing to improve. As we said, we're continuing to do better. I can say one thing, we're the only railroad that I know of in North America that never shut a terminal down because we were congested so -- because we're intensely focused on the fact that everybody wanted to use e-commerce, and we were going to make sure we were there for the country when they needed us. So I'm very proud of the job this year that everybody did. So our other metrics, clearly, our velocity has stabilized. Our dwell has stabilized. We're beginning to turn the corner. I said, we're going to get to 60 -- 700 -- 7,000 employees when we said we would. And that's the plan, and that's what CSX is always done here in the last 4.5 years, and that's what we're going to do this time. Big pictures. Everybody looks at me for that -- to answer that question. Well, I guess, by big picture, I mean, from an economy standpoint because I don't know what the next thing they can throw at us that we haven't seen in the last 2.5 years here. So I think the railroads are in CSX and the railroad industry in general is well-positioned right now with everything that's going on in terms of issues associated with congestion, issues associated with highway congestion, issues concerning the environment. More and more and more customers every single day are asking us about what it is we can do for them to help them with their ESG targets. My experience in the railroad business is when you -- if there is a bigger downturn or a downturn in the economy, to the extent that our service gets back to where the reliability we had pre pandemic. We're a great option for companies when they need to reduce their costs, and they need to reduce their transportation spend and people who are making decisions based on, I don't care what it costs to get it there, just get it there. And we're going to pay 25 times the historical average rate to move a container from A to B. What they want to do is save money, that's where our -- that's where we really get to play more in the game because we're always substantially cheaper than a truck. So, everything winds up for us to the -- but it's all based upon our ability given number of employees in here that we need so that we can prove to the customer that we're reliable. As Kevin just said, it's across the board. People that historically always move grain by rail or trucking it. People -- the supply chains are completely disrupted and to -- in some areas, completely dysfunctional. So, things will return to normal. We will get back to where we were, and we'll continue to grow share, principally by competing with and beginning to convert more and more traffic off the highway all the time. Well, Kevin might want to weigh in, but as I said, it's everybody in the supply chain when we're talking about moving coal trains from a mine to a utility or from a mine to an export terminal. It's not just the railroad. We need everybody in the supply chain to work, when you're talking about moving international boxes from a port to a warehouse on the south side of Chicago, we need the terminal to work, you need the railroad to work. You need the inland terminal to work, you need to have chassis there. You need to have packers there. You need to have somebody there that can unload the box when it gets to the warehouse and get it off the chassis and can get it back. There are billion moving parts, we play a role in that in many respects. And each one of those key elements in the supply chain is challenged. So we need to get better. Everybody needs to get better. And you get a sense, generally, the things are gradually improving. And again, you see that in every industry, that is not working properly because of the issues associated with the shortage of employees. Big picture question. Thanks a lot, Jeff, following up with an easy one, soft ball. I might -- no. As I said before, I think the railroad industry is extremely well-positioned, not just for the short-term, for the long-term with everything that's going on in the world, globally, United States, you name it, reshoring, issues associated with this and the other thing, highway congestion, you name it. I think the railroad industry is extremely well-positioned to be a much more relevant and key player in the transportation network and shipment of customers' goods going forward. And so if we're more relevant, if we provide a better service in your -- a key component that should be good for our markets, not bad for our margins. We're in much more sought after product service as opposed to just a transportation commodity. So that is -- so that's good. Can I fix the global hunger? No. Can I solve the pandemic? No. Can I fix CSX and his team, do I have 100% confidence in the people that work for CSX to get this railroad back and running than what it was and then even better? Yes. So, I can't fix the chassis shortage problems. I can't fix -- I can't invest in coal mines. I can't move this. I can't move that. But that will all correct itself over time. And we will be a much bigger participant in that. And like I said, I think we've got a great future ahead of us."

Overall volumes were flat, where we saw strong demand across many of our markets, limited by resource constraints across the supply chain. Merchandise revenue increased 10% on flat volume, driven by price and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Looking at some of the highlights. We are encouraged by strength in automotive market, where revenues rose 24% on a 10% increase in volume. There are clear signs from auto manufacturers that semiconductor challenges are easing. Our minerals business benefited from improved shipments of aggregates in salt. Our ag and food segment saw growth from ethanol and export drains. Less favorable was our fertilizer business, where volumes and revenues declined year-over-year on reduced phosphate shipments. Volatile fertilizer prices, combined with some production issues, impacted volumes in the quarter. Forest products along with metals and equipment saw positive revenue growth, offset by modest declines in volumes, mainly driven by resource constraints. Intermodal revenue increased 18% on 1% higher volume as growth in the international business was partially offset by lower domestic shipments, driven by continued equipment challenges through the quarter. Intermodal demand remains strong and customers continue to recognize our industry-leading service product in a challenged market. Coal revenue increased 54% on 3% lower volume. As we have discussed, coal demand remains strong across our domestic and international markets. Volumes have been constrained by production issues at the mine, infrastructure constraints at the port, including Curtis Bay and general man power shortages, including crews. We still expect volumes to improve through the year as some of these constraints moderate. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage. Although macro uncertainty is clearly elevated as we enter into the second half, we still see positive drivers favoring rail, including environmental benefits as customers prioritize ESG, lack of truck capacity with driver shortages, onshoring of industrial production and inflation that will all benefit our growth opportunities. Currently, we are still seeing demand in many markets limited by the global shortage of labor. We believe this will continue to benefit rail's value proposition and the opportunity to increase mobile share over time. Going forward, we remain committed to making the investments needed to serve our customers and helping them grow their business. Let me now turn it over to Jamie to discuss operations. Yes. And then on the coal RPU, look, obviously, the met coal prices have come down, as everybody has seen. Our expectation right now, given where things are, is probably you'll look at the RPU in line with what we saw in the first quarter, so a little bit down from the second quarter. And then on the other revenue line, supplemental other revenue, probably something flattish versus this quarter outside of the market changing dramatically, which we don't see right now. Hey Chris, this is Kevin. As I mentioned and Jim mentioned it, I think, a couple of times, demand continues to outstrip supply chain. We're not alone. It's the supply chain in general, and we're part of that supply chain with the crew issue that we're having. Right now, if you look at the back half of the year, when you look on just a purely comp basis, we have easy comps on the auto business, and we clearly have seen that production start to pick up the here. So we're encouraged on what's happening there. We've had some disruption on the coal side of the business. So we think that will continue to improve in the back half of the year. So there are some things that just from a comparison point of view get better as we move into the back half of the year. And then as the crews come online, we'll go and get -- chase those opportunities that we know are out there in terms of market share and then the existing opportunities that we know that are out there in terms of order fill rates, things like that, that we're highly focused on as a team and see the opportunity going forward. So nothing has really changed from the last quarter when we see a pretty robust environment, but we're not -- we're also keeping an eye on what's going on. Clearly, the housing markets had some pressure out there, but we have exposure there, but there's other areas where, quite frankly, there's a lot of inventory restocking that still needs to happen. Yes, that's our view, given the demand environment that we're seeing right now. Hey, Justin, it's Kevin. Nothing has really changed with our outlook. Obviously, the GDP number is moving out around quite a bit, but that's -- a lot has changed since the beginning of the year. Clearly, inflation has moved up a lot more than what people believe coming into the year. And so we've -- that's probably been more reflected in price. And then on the volume side, probably not as quick of a recovery from a supply chain as we anticipated, but still given the favorable comp comparisons that we have in the back half of the year, we expect growth. Hey, on the yields, I think you covered one of them. Obviously, the fuel surcharge and there's a bit of a lag there as we move from second quarter and third quarter. So that can move around quite a bit, but you understand how that works and we'll adjust as that moves around a bit on the diesel prices. The other one that I covered earlier was really on the export coal pricing. What we're seeing today is obviously some moderation of the really, really high prices. The environment is still very, really good for us. We would take these price levels any day. It's just that they're coming off the stream level. So we'll see some moderation there. But outside of that, clearly, when we're having contract negotiations with our customers, they understand the high inflation environment we're dealing with today. And obviously, on the labor side and other parts of our business, and we're having to recapture that value in those discussions. So as things reprice, we're or making sure we stay in line with what's happening out there in the market and what we're having to pay expense-wise. So we probably would still see some underlying momentum there as well. But outside of that, nothing really changes into the back half of the year. I think it goes beyond just the intermodal and boxcar. You think about the coal network. And look, some of this is on the coal mines and some of the export facilities that have had a lot of issues as well. So it's -- we're part of that puzzle piece with the crew issue on that side of the business. But I would say it's a limited just the boxcar intermodal. When I think about some of the other markets like auto and we're playing a little bit of catch-up there as well. So there's opportunities across almost every market that we serve today."

            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. In the face of these challenging labor market conditions as well as ongoing supply chain issues, CSX delivered over $800 million in revenue growth with gains across all major markets. Expenses were also up over $800 million and as a result, reported operating income increased 1%. However, as I will explain in more detail on the next slide, costs were heavily impacted by lower real estate gains, the addition of Quality Carriers, and transaction costs and higher fuel. Interest expense was $10 million favorable to the prior year, while other income improved $6 million. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.4%. Turning to the next slide. Total costs increased $813 million. Nearly $500 million of the higher expense was due to the inclusion of Quality Carriers, lower gains on property dispositions, and Pan Am acquisition costs. Real estate gains were driven by the Virginia transaction, with a $122 million impact this quarter versus $349 million in the prior year. This represents our last significant gain from Virginia and we expect to receive the remaining $125 million of cash proceeds in the fourth quarter. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor with fuel expense up over $200 million, excluding the Quality impact. Not surprisingly, inflation is running above historical levels. And the $56 million on this slide represents inflation across labor, purchased services, and rents. All other expenses increased by $50 million, with approximately $20 million higher depreciation, about $10 million lower incentive compensation expense, and nearly $40 million of higher operating costs. This $40 million reflects increased hiring and retention, the impact of a larger active locomotive fleet, intermodal terminal costs from supply chain disruptions, and slower car cycle times. As service levels normalize in the coming quarters, we would expect the opportunity set on the expense side to come first from these operating categories. Now, turning to cash flow on slide 11. On a year-to-date basis, free cash flow before dividends is down by approximately $125 million, but up about $75 million when adjusting for proceeds from the Virginia transaction in the prior year. Capital spending is up nearly $6 0 million and for the full year, we still expect to invest approximately $2 billion in our network. This ensures safety and reliability with roughly 8 0% of these investments going to the core infrastructure and a growing amount being allocated to strategic and return-based projects. After fully funding capital demands, year-to-date shareholder returns have exceeded $2.9 billion, including over $2.5 billion in buybacks and over $400 million in dividends. This brings our cash and short-term investment balance down to a more normalized $800 million. And as we go forward, we will remain both balanced and opportunistic in our commitment to return excess cash to our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. Yes, Bascome, I can speak to that. So when we look at the union wage issue, we have been accruing for increased wages ever since the expiration of the last contract. When we do get to a settlement, we'll take a look back at that and see if an adjustment is necessary. If it is, we would take that all at once. And it's probably also worth noting that we've been accruing four back wages, which means that when we do get to a settlement, the employees who've been working with us for several years and not getting wage increases will likely get backpay. So there will be a cash impact around the time of whenever that settlement occurs. Yes, Bascome. I'm not at liberty to give any specific insight in terms of what we, CSX, are accruing. That's sort of based on our best guess of where the negotiations come out. And Justin, on the second part of the question around OpEx, I think it's fair to assume that OpEx is going to be fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. We will begin accruing for higher wages, the compounding impact of higher wages that would reset at mid-year. So you should see a little bit of an increase sequentially in the labor line. And to your Pan Am question, recognized on a fully integrated basis, it's about 1% of revenue or a little less than that. Figure the operating ratio on that business today is a little worse than our average and then spread the cost similar to our current spread, and that will probably get you there in terms of the Pan Am impact. But everything else relatively stable and the hope would be as crews continue to mark up and become available towards the latter part of next quarter as the vacation peak subsides, the network begins spinning, we begin to take some of those $40 million or so of costs out. Yes. And just adding to that, in terms of the operating ratio, I think the two things that are non-core or less inside our control, we had about $85 million in real estate gains last year. We're, obviously, always working on potential deals, but we'll see whether we have a similar number that materialize in the second half. And then fuel, if prices tail down and continue to go down, we'll have that favorable lag benefit that will help the OR. But if you set both of those items aside, we have sequential volumes gains into the second half of the year and expenses are relatively flat, excluding PanAm [ph] and the wage increase impact. And I think it would be fair to assume that we'll continue to have some good momentum on the margin side. Yes, Jason, about 50 basis points was Pan Am."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Q1 2022 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Matthew Korn, CSX Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome. Joining me on today\u2019s call are Jim Foote, President and Chief Executive Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, Sales and Marketing; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In our presentation, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on slide two, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. And with that, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Foote. Jim?\nJim Foote: Great. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for again joining us on our call today. I will begin by expressing my thanks to all of CSX employees, who continue to put in tremendous efforts to serve our customers effectively and above all safely. I\u2019d also like to welcome today, Steve Fortune, who\u2019s with us in the room here today in Jacksonville. Steve serves in a newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chief Digital and Technology Officer, and will focus on harnessing transformative technologies to further growth and enable continued efficiency across the business. His experience leading technology organizations at a global industrial company will be very helpful as we continue to transform CSX. Now moving to the quarter, we are pleased with our results this quarter, though we are not yet satisfied with our service performance. The effects of COVID and severe weather across much of our network clearly led to a tough start to the year. But as we moved into March, operating conditions began to gradually improve and we do see indications that this momentum is continuing. For over a year, we have communicated to you that the key to rebuilding our service to pre-pandemic levels is to hire more trained and engine service employees. I am pleased to say that our efforts there are progressing well and our active T&E count has moved steadily higher this year. The people and resources that we are putting in place today will allow us to provide reliable, efficient service to an expanding number of customers. The business environment remains very favorable for CSX, despite new uncertainties across global supply chains. We are dedicated to do our part to help our customers here in North America meet increasing demand, as business and consumers around the world look for reliable sources of the products that we transport. Meanwhile, domestic activity remains robust, and our business development and marketing groups are working hard to convert new opportunities. And as higher energy prices and increasing scrutiny on greenhouse gas emissions, highlight rails efficiency advantages over trucks, we are in a great position. If we all do our jobs, hold to our principles and deliver the service levels that we know we can achieve, this company has great potential for many years ahead. Lastly, I\u2019d like to note that we are pleased with the Surface Transportation Board approved our acquisition of Pan Am Railways, which clears the way for the transaction to close this June. All of us are excited about the opportunities that will come as we design new service solutions for shippers and receivers in New England. Now let\u2019s turn to slide four. Turning to the presentation, which highlights our key financial results, we moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 16% to $1.28 billion. The operating ratio increased by 150 basis points to 62.4%. But remember, this range includes approximately 250 basis points of impact from quality carriers and the impact of higher fuel prices. And earnings per share increased 26% to $0.39 a share. I will now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide five. First quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year, with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volume as strong pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the volume decline. Current demand remains strong across most merchandise markets, with shippers prioritizing environmental benefits of rail and pursuing lower cost options to offset inflation. The ongoing semiconductor shortage impacted automotive volumes through the quarter. However, we did see sequential improvement as consumer demand remains strong with dealer inventory levels low. Our core chemical franchise saw strong demand that more than offset continued challenges in energy-related chemical markets. As we continue to add resources across the network, we expect to capture additional opportunities. Intermodal revenue increased 13% on 1% lower volumes, as truck conversions drove domestic growth. Offsetting declines in the international market that continues to be impacted by supply side constraints. Intermodal demand remains strong, but continues to be challenged by takeaway capacity and equipment shortages including chassis. Coal revenue increased 39% on 10% lower volume. Export coals revenue increase was driven by higher benchmark prices, partially offset by lower domestic and international thermal coal shipments. First coal -- first quarter coal volumes were impacted by several factors, including mine disruptions in an outage at our Curtis Bay export facility. Demand across all of our coal markets remains strong and we expect volumes to improve in the second quarter, as some of these headwinds subside and additional network capacity is added. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage, but was partially offset by lower payments from customers that did not meet volume commitments. As we exit the quarter, concerns around the Omicron variant have been replaced by broader global supply chain uncertainty in the wake of the crisis in Ukraine. As Jim mentioned, we are committed to helping our customers. In North America meet the increasing demand for their products from consumers around the world. We are working closely with our customers to understand the potential shifts in the global supply chain. And while it is early, we see opportunities that could benefit our network and the port\u2019s we serve. As we look across many of our markets, demand continues to outstrip supply. We expect this to improve as resources are added across the supply chain. Now turning to slide six. I\u2019d like to provide more detail on CSX\u2019s business development capabilities, which I briefly discussed last quarter. CSX has an experienced team of business development professionals to help existing and prospective customers identify, design and build facilities across the network. This team works closely with state and local economic developers to maximize investment incentives that will encourage more businesses to locate on CSX and our short line partners. These efforts continue to pay off. In 2021, over 90 new facilities and expansion projects were placed into service across our network, which represents over $3 billion of customer investment. Additionally, there are over 500 projects currently in an industrial pipeline. We are excited to work with these customers and provide them with efficient and reliable rail service that will enable them to grow their business for years, while creating significant long-term value for CSX shareholders. Most recently VinFast, the electric vehicle subsidiary of the large Asian conglomerate Vingroup announced that they will build a $4 billion electric vehicle assembly plant and battery manufacturing facility served exclusively by CSX. The team is proud to be part of North Carolina\u2019s first car plant in the largest economic development announcement in the state\u2019s history. This announcement is an excellent example of the kind of customer solutions that the team can deliver, as sales and marketing works closely with operators. The team is working diligently to direct even more customers to CSX by Select Site program. CSX Select Sites feature nearly 10,000 acres of premium certified rail serve sites to full scale industrial development and expansion. We are working to add even more sites to this program in 2022. I will now pass it on to Jamie to discuss our operations.\nJamie Boychuk: Thanks, Kevin. The safety of our operations will always be our first priority. Our concern for all of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate drives us to make sure that we maintain the demanding standards of our safety focused culture. The results that you see on slide seven show this clearly. Over the first quarter, we saw sequential and year-over-year improvements in the number of injuries and train accidents, which brought their frequency rates to a near record low levels for the first quarter. We are happy to see this improvement. We continue to push forward with the initiatives that we described to you last quarter, actively coaching, safety awareness among our employees, encouraging best practice sharing across teams and expanding our application of technology, and we put a very strong emphasis on our efforts with our new hires to ensure that they respect and demonstrate the principles that make CSX an industry safety leader. Moving on to slide eight. For the last several quarters, you have heard us discuss the efforts we are making to address our staffing levels. This is a critical point, because our networks, capacity and fluidity will improve when we have enough trained conductors and engineers. When we have these resources, it lifts our service performance in the near-term, while also ensuring that we are ready to meet the substantial demand growth we anticipate in the years ahead. This slide also shows several important positive train and engine employee trends that reflect the hard work done by our recruiting and training teams. We have made great progress here and importantly, we are set up to build on the momentum we have created. First, you can see a strong ramp up in the number of T&E employees we have in our training program. We averaged over 500 daily employees in training over the first quarter, which is over 5 times where we were a year ago. We expect to keep our training classes full to make sure that our pipeline remains healthy. Second, we have successfully increased our run rate of conductors who are completing their training and marking up into the active T&E population. We now have roughly 100 employees marking up each month who are ready to haul freight, generate revenue and we expect this pace to continue. In the last chart, you can see the payoff, return in the corner and we are now adding to our active T&E count month-over-month. We have said it again and again, our aim is to grow this railroad, so that we need to bring good people in, train them the right way and deliver on service. It takes time, but this is exactly what we are doing. Now let\u2019s turn to slide seven, which gives us a picture on where our operations stand today. This quarter started off with several key challenges. The Omicron wave was hitting our employees, where the incident at our Curtis Bay facility and the East Coast suffered under severe weather in early February. So for the full quarter, our key metrics of trip line compliance, terminal car dwell and velocity were generally flat to slightly worse on a sequential basis. That said, as Jim highlighted in his remarks, early into the second quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs that these metrics are starting to move in the right direction. It\u2019s clearly too quick to call the bottom with certainty, but with the success of our hiring initiatives, and a continued drive for discipline and consistency in the field, we see reasons to be optimistic. Consistent with the last quarter, we have made the tactical decision to keep additional locomotives active in the near-term to help with network balance, while we remain short of employees in certain regions. As we successfully promote our new conductors, we will be focused on improving our asset utilization and driving efficiency as the additional crew resources facilitate higher volumes and improve service and reliability. As always, the key will be strong execution and I am excited at the level of higher engagement and enthusiasm that our operating team is bringing to this challenge. I am looking forward to showing what we can do over this next quarter, the rest of the year and the years to come. I will now hand it over to Sean to review the financial results.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Our focus is on profitable growth and despite the challenges we faced in the quarter, we delivered $600 million of revenue gains, with operating income of 16%. Interest expense and other income were a combined $11 million favorable and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%. Earnings per share of $0.39 reflects growth in core earnings, as well as the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. Turning to the next slide. Total costs increased $419 million or 24% in the quarter, but we are in line with our expectations outside of the spike in fuel price. The acquisition of Quality Carriers represented approximately $215 million of expense. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about $110 million versus last year. All other expenses increased approximately $95 million, driven by inflation, as well as ongoing costs related to supply chain congestion and network fluidity. Turning to the specific line items, labor and fringe expense increased $72 million or 12% in the quarter. We invested $10 million more to onboard new train and engine employees, and we expect similar training costs next quarter, as we continue to convert our strong new hire pipeline. Quality Carriers drove about $35 million in additional labor expense. Incentive compensation increased $6 million, while inflation and other impacts drove just over $20 million of higher costs. Purchased services and other expense increased $203 million or 43% in the quarter. Quality Carriers represented approximately $140 million of PS and other expense. Costs incurred to maintain terminal and network fluidity added roughly $45 million of expense in the quarter similar to last quarter\u2019s impact. These costs are likely to persist into the second quarter and we expect to see improvement in the back half of the year, corresponding to labor and supply chain normalization. Additionally, a legacy environmental reserve adjustment drove $17 million of higher expense in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization was up $15 million or 4% higher asset base that also includes the quality impact. Finally, fuel expense increased to $141 million or 74%, reflecting a steep increase in highway diesel fuel prices, as well as the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. The rapid rise in fuel prices created approximately $45 million of fuel lag in the quarter. And lastly, the company recognized $27 million of real estate gains in the quarter, including $20 million related to the Virginia transaction. As a reminder, we expect to recognize the $120 million Virginia gain in the second quarter and receive the final $125 million cash payment in the fourth quarter. Now turning to cash flow on slide 12. Free cash flow before dividends increased on higher earnings to $976 million. Our highest priority use of cash is investing for the long-term reliability and growth of our railroad. After fully funding these capital projects, first quarter shareholder returns exceeded $1.2 billion, including approximately a $1 billion in buybacks and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach as we continue to return excess cash to our shareholders. Finally, we are excited to close the Pan Am deal on June 1st. Pan Am will contribute about 1 point of annualized revenue, primarily within merchandise. Due to transaction and integration costs, Pan Am will have a negligible impact on earnings this year and the capital we expect to invest to upgrade to Pan Am network is already contemplated in our guidance. We look forward to working with Pan Am and its customers to drive continued growth through our integrated rail network. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks.\nJim Foote: Okay. So let\u2019s conclude with our outlook for the year as shown on slide 13. We continue to benefit from strong markets and ample customer demand, and we are adding employs the needs that our network can capture more of the business opportunities that are right in front of us. At the same time, we are of course keeping a close eye on inflation, interest rates and the fed. With support from higher coal prices and a supportive market environment, we feel comfortable projecting double-digit growth for both revenue and operating income for the full year. In the near-term, we expect to continue to benefit from elevated export coal prices and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Full year CapEx is planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged. We have made progress since the beginning of the year and we still have a lot of work to do, but we are committed to supporting our customers by providing them with reliable, efficient, cost effective rail solutions for their changing transportation needs. By adding the necessary resources and lifting our service levels, we will be well-positioned for years of profitable growth. Thanks and I will turn it back to Matthew.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Jim. Now in the interest of time, I\u2019d ask that everyone please limit yourself to just one question. And with that, Emma, we will now be happy to take questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Jamie, you spent a fair amount of time talking about the important labor aspects and what -- and your optimism about what that will mean for service? Is it just a function of getting the people trained in the right spots or are there any other challenges that you are seeing, it\u2019s related to service reliability? These are things that you can control yourself, are things outside of your control, like customers turning over equipment more quickly and how do you think that all of that translates into the important service metrics like velocity dwell and cars online in the next couple of quarters?\nJamie Boychuk: Well, good evening or good afternoon, Jon. For us, it\u2019s purely comes down to hiring numbers and getting more T&E folks where we need them. Kevin and I have been worked really closely with our customers to do everything we can to support those needs of our customers. And our customers are working with us in different areas with different solutions as we look at how we can turn cars quicker, whether it comes down to block loading by destination and other items that we have been working on for years and continuing to work with our customers that way, so we don\u2019t have to handle cars as much. But definitely, when we are looking at that pure number with respect to our trainees out there, we talked about having 500 or 500 trainings out there right now. We have qualified up to 400 already this year since the start of the year. So we have come a long way in that area and we continue to pull whatever levers we can with respect to the design, if there\u2019s cars we can move in different corridors that make more sense where our crew base has gotten healthier, we are doing that. But really as we continue to push forward here, the common theme that we know we will get our railroad back to where we need to is just continuing to train conductors.\nJon Chappell: Got it. Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. I guess, if we go back to last quarter, you guys were, I think, the only guides you provide those like volume above GDP. But now it seems you have some confidence to guide to double-digit op income and revenue growth. Can you just talk to maybe the increased confidence as you have gone through the year here and what\u2019s driving that guidance now?\nJim Foote: Yeah. Brandon, look, there\u2019s a lot of moving parts. Obviously, one, they get confidence and the hiring trajectory, and Jamie spoke to that, we are seeing good momentum as we get into April and we will move through the rest of the quarter. Obviously, some other factors have occurred. You have seen the export coal market remain really, really strong here and supportive, and we had assumed probably that market would tail off a little bit sooner than what is expected now. Also fuel surcharge has been a bigger factor going forward as well as oil prices have obviously moved up dramatically here with the Ukraine crisis going on. But the number of factors going, we still see the strong demand from all of our markets and we have competence that we are going to begin to capture more and more of that as we -- as fluidity picks up through the network.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is now open.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And I guess to start with the follow up on that last question. Does the guidance still assume that volumes outpace GDP this year? And then, is there any color you can give on the OR excluding the Virginia real estate sale that\u2019s embedded in that assumption for double-digit operating income growth?\nJim Foote: Yeah. I will cover the first one. Look, that\u2019s been our target. We want to outgrow the economy. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts, as you know, the auto business -- automotive business is going to be a big factor as we get in the second half and that business on production needs to recover there to really hit those GDP plus targets. So that\u2019s one market to look at. Coal, as well, we see strong demand there, but we will be watching that going forward. And then the intermodal market, particularly on the domestic side, we are assuming chassis and other drayage capacity comes back into the market and that will drive some incremental growth for us as well. So there\u2019s a few moving parts, but that\u2019s always our target and that\u2019s why we came out at the beginning of the year as we expect to exceed GDP volume growth, but realizing that there\u2019s a number of new moving parts going on right now.\nSean Pelkey: And Justin, this is Sean. Just to add on with the OR question, I think it\u2019s -- as we have always said, the -- we expect the incremental margins on the growth to be very strong and very healthy, and that will be supportive in terms of the OR for the year. But there are some things to keep in mind that will be offsets, obviously, the quality impact, which will have the full impact of it in the first half of the year, given that the acquisition occurred in Q3 of last year. Higher fuel prices are essentially neutral to op income, but they do have a negative impact on the operating ratio as well. And then, obviously intermodal storage as things normalize, that will have an impact on the OR, particularly in the second half of the year, given that the storage revenues were quite elevated in the second half of last year.\nJustin Long: Okay. I will leave it there. I appreciate the time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is now open\nChris Wetherbee: Hey. Great. Thanks and good afternoon. I guess I wanted to come back a little bit to the sort of bigger picture, freight demand comment that you made earlier in the call, Jim, I just maybe if you could talk a little bit about what you are seeing either on the consumer or the industrial side, we can kind of see what\u2019s happening on the commodity side, but maybe those two end markets? And then maybe just sort of weave that into the market share potential opportunity? Congestion has probably kept some business off the rail and on other modes of transportation. How does that factor in? So, I guess, generally speaking, you see a slowdown in consumer driven freight and is there enough upside potential in industrial commodity to offset that?\nJim Foote: Well, I think, we have been going through since really the middle of 2018 divergence between the consumer economy and the industrial economy, whether it was driven by going back to the tariff issues that began to create concern amongst the industrial producers, and at the same time, you had a consumer economy that was going gangbusters. And that kind of carried forward into the pandemic years, let\u2019s call it, the plague years of 2020 and 2021 and industrial really got hammered, especially in still -- there\u2019s still lingering effects from that and it\u2019s a -- look at the automotive sector and the consumer economy went nuts. So, now, I think, you are starting to see those two divergent economies come back more in line and industrial demand is very good. Is it -- I think it\u2019s clear in our comments. We have not met the demand and as the railroad on the industrial side and the bulk side of the business, we have done a very -- I think we have done an amazing job in handling the consumer side of the business in the intermodal sector throughout the last couple of years. So the demand is there, as the railroad begins to continue to improve as we go forward, we see a lot of opportunity and there could be changes, while there are obviously -- obviously, there are going to be changes in various supply chains, whether it\u2019s import/export grain, whether it\u2019s continued demand for U.S. coal, steel, plastics, chemicals, you name it, everything is going to be moving around a little bit. But we see all of these sectors being assuming that everything in the world stays relatively sane, where we are today, if you don\u2019t want to call the sanity, a great environment for us to excel and the only reason we haven\u2019t achieved it in the last, nine months ago, I said that the numbers that we are talking about today, in terms of where we would be with hiring, that\u2019s where we thought we would be nine months ago. The extremely tight labor market and the higher -- somewhat higher attrition rates that we went through have held us back and so we have figured it out. We have done everything we could possibly do to take advantage of the situation. And I think the economy on both, especially so on the industrial side of the economy, where traditionally railroads have excelled looks favorable as we look forward.\nChris Wetherbee: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. Thanks. This is Mike Toran [ph] on for Tom. You have made really good progress on adding the T&E employees. Is there -- do you have an idea of or which point this year you think you are going to be all kind of trued up from a T&E crew perspective? And also, is there a way to quantify how much volume you have left on the table because of the crew constraints that you will be able to capture once you are kind of fully trued up on cruise?\nJim Foote: Well, in terms of what we left behind, I will use a term that Tom uses quite often lots and I will leave it at that. In terms of where we are going to be, from a timing standpoint, where we will get, but I will say, what Jamie mentioned earlier, we are going to continue to hire. We are going to manage this employee pipeline differently than we have in the past. We are going to make sure that lessons learned here that we are going to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen to us again. And so that\u2019s why we are doing everything we can from an employee relations standpoint to work closer with our employees, because they are critical and key to what we want to do here and that is provide a reliable truck like product across all of our, well, truck likes reliability to all of our customers, because that\u2019s the key to the future for the company\u2019s growth. Jamie, do you want any color about timing.\nJamie Boychuk: Our timing is, we are really shooting in towards the third quarter. As we push the number of employees, we have training right now, if those qualified and we continue to do our hiring of 30 to 40 every single week, puts us in a good position at some point in the third quarter, it might be towards the tail end of the third quarter. And then -- and to Jim\u2019s point, we are continuing to hire for attrition as attrition moves forward. We have seen attrition climb up and we got to make sure that we stay ahead of that throughout this year and then into next year and we have got many different programs that we want to continue to train locomotive engineers and other pieces. So we are not going to be stopping at any point in time here soon. But we feel pretty confident as long as the world doesn\u2019t throw us some type of a curveball again. Q3 is going to be a much better quarter for us.\nJim Foote: Just yeah and a little more color on that.\nUnidentified Analyst: Yeah.\nJim Foote: It is easy for us to manage now. We have an attrition rate of around 7%. So we are not concerned with getting fat, because we can always manage down. What we have learned over the last year, year and a half is, it is extremely difficult. It is a completely different environment to try and add to the workforce. So we just have to look at it a little differently. That doesn\u2019t mean we are going to get fat and happy and have a bunch of employees that we don\u2019t need. That means that we are going to manage the workforce differently to make sure with the ebbs and flows of this business, which is always the case that we do it in a more -- in a different manner. So we don\u2019t get caught short like we just did.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Jamie. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. So I want to maybe think about the back half of the years, sounds like that\u2019s when you think you will have the headcount where you want it to be in the network where you want it to be? Do you still think that you will have volume growth in excess of headcount in the back half of the year? And then maybe, Sean, how much is the -- how much are you spending in 1Q and 2Q on hiring and network and efficiencies that may be potentially starts to go away in the back half of the year?\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. Scott, to your -- first part of your question, I mean, remember, we are -- with all we are doing in hiring, we are netting up roughly 1% a quarter on a sequential basis. So that that -- the cumulative impact of that is a couple of percent year-over-year in headcount by the time we get to the second half of the year, and yeah, I think we ought to be able to grow in excess of that. We have got capacity on trains and in the network. We have got locomotives to move the freight. So we should be able to outpace it in terms of growth. And then in terms of your question on the cost side, those training costs are -- it\u2019s up $10 million versus last year, so call it, roughly $15 million a quarter that we are spending on training right now. I don\u2019t see that going away. Like, Jim just said, we are going to continue to hire. So that\u2019s probably pretty reasonable across the balance of the year. The piece that is probably more variable is the $45 million or so that we mentioned in purchase services and others. Most of which is really related to supply chain congestion, whether it be costs related to intermodal container yards and terminal labor, outsource labor or whether it be related to having more locomotives than we would otherwise need if the network were running faster, there\u2019s also an impact to rent. So think about it in terms of that roughly $45 million is the opportunity to kind of get back to where we were once we get this thing spinning.\nScott Group: Okay. And if I can just sneak in one more quickly for Kevin. The coal RPU, is this -- are we seeing the full benefit at this point of the net prices and everything or is there one more potential leg up here?\nKevin Boone: No. I think this is largely -- some of our -- on the met side, some of the contracts are capped. So they don\u2019t fully to participate in these extreme prices. So this is probably a good run rate, assuming that core prices stay at those current levels they are today.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys. Appreciate.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Just coming back to labor, and Jim, maybe if you can elaborate on how you expect to manage the workforce a bit differently. I know it\u2019s challenging especially right now to manage everything, all the different moving parts. But is this more technology, are these different types of rules that you expect to put into place? And on that line if you got the $600 incentive -- up to $600 incentives that you announced yesterday, do you feel like you have done everything you can at this point to really get the people where you need and the amount you need them in place?\nJim Foote: Well, I think, anybody that\u2019s followed the railroad business for a long time, like you have and everybody else on the call knows that the relationships between the railroads and the union workforce is not necessarily been one of mutual admiration and we need to fix that and we are working extremely hard. And throughout this process, we have, I mean, these guys were out there for two years in the middle of a pandemic working every single day and night in a chaotic operating environment caused by surges in traffic and you name it. And at the same time didn\u2019t get a raise. That\u2019s wrong in my opinion. And that\u2019s why we decided to do something about it unilaterally without asking for some kind of get back in the labor agreement. We just thought it was the right thing to do and so we made the offer and that\u2019s a change. It\u2019s not technology. It\u2019s relationship building with your unionized workforce and we need to change that and we are going to -- we are dedicated to changing that. And it is an ongoing long-term process, but CSX is committed to trying to do everything we can possibly do to change decades if not centuries of the somewhat dysfunctional relationship with our human workforce, that\u2019s the key and that\u2019s what this is all about.\nBrian Ossenbeck: All right. Thank you, Jim.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Great. Good afternoon. So you gave the double-digit operating income targets and the cost. I just want understand what\u2019s built in for the timing of the fluidity, is that just simply the second half? And in the past we have seen, I guess, rails throw a lot of assets to get the fluidity moving, is that something you -- we need to do to get things moving aside from the employees? And then, I guess to follow that, Jim, into next week hearing as to what you are doing to fix the service, is just the focus here, the key on employees or again is there equipment need or anything to kind of throw at these backlogs to get the fluidity moving up the rail network? Thanks.\nJim Foote: So we are not short of locomotives. We are not short of any physical infrastructure in order to be able to perform and that we continue to still have excess capacity across the railroad. There is one thing and one thing only that we are short of that is hampering us from doing the job that we want to do and to get back to the service levels where we were in 2019 and to get even better from that point on is we need more people in the engineer and conductor ranks. That\u2019s it. We don\u2019t need them anywhere else in the organization. We don\u2019t need more management people. We don\u2019t need a lot -- we don\u2019t need more people fixing the track and laying rail. They are doing a great job out there. We need more engineers and conductors, and that\u2019s it and that\u2019s what we are dedicated to do and that is why we will continue to focus on these numbers. And it is a lengthy process from the time we finally get someone, it is an extremely lengthy process from the time we start looking for somebody that in this day and age might want to be a railroad conductor until the time they have gone through the classroom. First of all, the pre-employment screening, then by the time they go through the month or more of classroom instruction and then six months on the job training and then we have to make sure at that point in time, they are equipped and ready to go out and work in a railroad operating environment and not get hurt and not hurt somebody else. It\u2019s a long, long process and that\u2019s why it has taken so long. As I said earlier, nine months longer, because of the front end of the process was not went away from us. The pipeline of normal candidate that might want to -- usually wanted to work in the railroad business, they don\u2019t want to go to work. They wanted to stay home. They wanted to do something else. And so we have had to revamp, work extremely hard and now we are beginning to realize the benefits of all that hard work and it\u2019s going to be month after month after month after month with these employees are then qualified, they actually go out and start performing work and as the year goes on, on a month-to-month-to-month basis, we will see continued improvements in fluidity and increases in the speed of the network, when the net -- so you have got a compounding effect. You are short of employees and you can\u2019t run the trains, so the network slows down. When the network slows down, you need more people. So we need to get the railroad back staffed, so that we can get the velocity and dwell down to where it was, that will then right-size our workforce to what we need and then we can more effectively manage it with the view that Kevin and his team provide us about where the opportunity is. Listen, they are not -- Kevin and his team are not shy about telling us on a regular basis where they see opportunity. It\u2019s out there. And we want to get it, we want to move it, because that\u2019s what we do and make a lot of money doing it.\nKen Hoexter: And just to clarify there, the timing for the fluidity returned, is that by the third quarter year end?\nJim Foote: Well, I would hope, again, I hate to give projections, because I was already off by nine months on the last one. We will -- yeah, you will see Mr. Boychuk always gets nervous when I start making projections. I wonder railroad is going to start running better. The railroad will start running better in this quarter and it will get better in the third quarter and it will get better in the fourth quarter. And the operating performance of the company I hope then will continue to get better and better and better and better all the time. 2019 was not nirvana. 2019 is the base camp we want to get back to where we were which was record level of performance, but there was not where we were satisfied being the way we wanted to run the company and run the railroad. We wanted to get even better from there and we hopefully will be able to do that. But it\u2019s going to be a gradual improvement as we go through the remainder of this year.\nKen Hoexter: Jim and team, I appreciate the time. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone. I just want to ask a little bit on yields and there\u2019s a lot of moving parts there with fuel surcharges and accessorial charges. Just curious how you would point investors to how your yield might develop over on a year-over-year basis going forward, particularly we are -- if we were to assume fuel prices remain constant. Are we going to see yields come down as some of these accessorial charges come off as fluidity improves, and therefore, should we be more looking at negative yield as opposed to our natural inclination in the rail sector to see pricing levels generally move higher. Could we see some noise in the near-term as a result of some of the rollover of -- as you are fluidity improves and some of those charges come off?\nKevin Boone: Hey. This is Kevin. I -- when you look at what\u2019s happening right now, certainly I think Sean spoke to it. We would expect some of the storage fees and those things that come down to more normalized level. But that\u2019s a good thing. That means that supply chain is becoming more fluid. I mean we are moving more freight with the rail network that\u2019s exactly what we want to happen and so from that perspective that\u2019s all good. When we looked at where we are today versus where we were last quarter when we had this call, inflation is gone up even more and we are having to have those conversations with our customer. We re-price about 50% to 60% of our business every year and we are having those conversations, because our customers are having those conversations with their customers. And so that\u2019s the environment we are in, so there is a bit of a lag when you think about pricing and realization of that we are have to realize through the year and we fully expect that those things will start to deliver as we move through the year.\nWalter Spracklin: That\u2019s great color. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.\nFadi Chamoun: Hey. Thank you. Maybe the question is to Kevin. I think you mentioned in your remark something about the supply chain changes that we are experiencing now and maybe trade flows and you mentioned that you see an opportunity for CSX\u2019s network and specifically at the port. I am wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that. And the second kind of point attached to that is, what do you would like to accomplish with the Pan Am specifically in terms of commercial and what carriers of traffic you think you have commercial opportunities to go after as you close on that transaction?\nKevin Boone: Sure. In terms of trade flows, what I was referring to there is, probably two issues. One I touched on the second slide that I covered we are seeing a lot more activity in terms of industrial re-shoring, more appetite for companies look at their supply chain. And quite frankly, supply chain resiliency is a competitive advantage now and companies are re-evaluating, do I want my production in Asia or do I wanted to overseas or would it be more appropriate to have an onshore closer to the consumers that are going to be buying the products and I am hopeful and we are seeing early signs, that\u2019s the case that they are making those decisions and spending capital behind it. The second one and this is extremely early and we are having a lot of conversations with customers, and Jim talked about this a little bit is, when you think about things like grain, which have largely huge amounts of supply of come out of the Ukraine and Russia and the Europe and other commodities and steel products and other things that are largely gone in the European market. Well, all of a sudden doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to happen and some of those things that we had traditionally moved out of the West Coast to supply Asia. Now maybe that\u2019s going to come out of the East Coast and benefit the ports that we serve. And again it\u2019s really, really early. We have to have conversations. We have to make sure that the capabilities are there to be able to deliver those products when that demand happens. So we are staying very, very close to the customer. Understanding what could potentially move from the West Coast potentially into the East Coast and working with them and being really dynamic in terms of how we think about it. That\u2019s what I am thinking about. We are looking at everything that\u2019s going out the ports today and how that could change over the next few months and it\u2019s probably, it\u2019s not a next month phenomenon, it\u2019s probably six months, nine months, 12 months from now, we are going to really start to see some impact if it happens.\nFadi Chamoun: Okay. And let me\u2026 JB How we see on the Pan Am\u2026\nFadi Chamoun: Yeah. Sorry. JB You want me to cover Pan Am?\nFadi Chamoun: Yeah. Please. JB Yeah. And then on Pan Am, look, it\u2019s a very good consumer market. There is a lot of paper packaging customers that want more access to markets that we serve. The waste business in that market is going to continue to grow. We see great opportunities there. And we think with a better rail service, that\u2019s going to open up many more markets that quite frankly, just from a transit time or reliability standpoint just we were unable to serve previously. So we are really excited, we are gearing up now that the approval has gone through and going to work closely to really capture those opportunities.\nFadi Chamoun: Okay. Thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey. Good afternoon guys. I have a question for you on the appetite to grow sort of the intermodal business generally. I mean I think trimming some of the intermodal network as part of PSR was the first step and we are, obviously, dealing with some of these service issues. But I am curious to get your help on reconciling kind of where market rates are, how attractive the margin that growth could be and what do you make of the third-party industry sort of adding something like 50,000 boxes to the fleet this year and coming out with a even bigger number for the next couple of years. I mean is this a market that you guys really want to lever into or are you going to remain a little bit more balanced between intermodal and merchandise growth? I am just trying to square the circle with what we are seeing in the container order book for the domestic players and your appetite to actually accommodate some of that growth?\nJim Foote: Well, I think, we are leading the industry in intermodal growth. So it is not in terms of volume. I think if not this year, next year for sure. In terms of volume, intermodal is going to be our biggest piece of business. That being said, so we want to -- we spent a lot of time and effort in 2017 and 2018 in re-engineering the way the intermodal network operated for reasons, so that we could have a good return on that business when we began to focus more intently on working in the key lanes where it makes sense for us to grow. We are beginning to I think have a better understanding of leveraging the East Coast ports, which have gone through a dramatic transformation in terms of growth versus the West Coast and have the much greater opportunity to expand that footprint in the East than they do in the West. And we are also working more and more and more at how we can participate in the Mexican intermodal market, which to-date we do basically nothing in. So whether it\u2019s international or domestic, the more players put asset towards the intermodal market, the more these markets further develop, we see great potential for us to continue to grow our intermodal franchise. That\u2019s not to say that we are in any way shape or form favoring that over the merchandise business. The merchandise business is a core part of our franchise. So we intend to grow both of these businesses. We see both of them as equal opportunity. Any business has a divergent book of business and so we don\u2019t -- we look at them both as exciting areas of opportunity.\nDavid Vernon: And Jim, and maybe just a quick follow-up, as you think about the UMAX fleet, do you look into add boxes to that, are you going to let the third-party sort of private fleet handle the investment in the actual boxes?\nJim Foote: Again that\u2019s a different book of business. Personally I am more in favor of us being more involved on an asset ownership basis, because we see great opportunity there for potential and whether it\u2019s UMAX or whether it\u2019s every place else, I don\u2019t like the model where 95% of the work and get 75% of the money. So to the extent that we can turn some of this business around and make it more favorable to our bottomline, I can guarantee you that any kind of an investment in asset in that area would have a great return.\nDavid Vernon: Thanks very much.\nJim Foote: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne with TD Securities. Your line is now open.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thanks very much. Good afternoon. In terms of the outlook for coal, you had touched on RPU already, but I wonder if you could comment on what you think the prospect is for increased coal volume this year? And within that, could you touch on whether it\u2019s primarily export coal that has influenced your outlook on both domestic and export?\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. I think when you look at some of the discrete items that I pointed out in the first quarter, we think some of those obviously are going to go away as we get through the year and then Jamie talked a lot about the additional resources we are adding and I think there are opportunities as the mines reinvest and they are making a lot of money right now and that allows them to reinvest in probably some deferred capital that they have had over the years. You would see some -- probably some better production coming out of those as well. So all else equal, if the market stays strong, we would anticipate some volume upside through the year.\nCherilyn Radbourne: And is it primarily export coal that\u2019s influence your outlook or is that to look at next\u2026\nSean Pelkey: No. No. When you look at Southern utilities, oh, sorry, yeah, I didn\u2019t address that when you look at our Southern utilities and even our Northern Utilities right now they are at low levels. And so there is an inventory replenishment that needs to happen that we are working diligently on and working closely with them the -- and with the mines to make sure that happens into the summer peak season. And then on the export side, that is then obviously very, very robust in terms of the demand. You are now seeing some -- probably some thermal opportunities with supply not there coming out of Russia and so we will see how that materializes. Right now, it\u2019s not a lack of demand, it\u2019s a supply constrained market and you have seen the coal producers probably favor that export met business rather than the thermal business. And Curtis Bay, you will see that. Jamie, just remind me that will come on in the third quarter and I will offer some additional opportunity as that comes back on the full capacity.\nCherilyn Radbourne: Thank you for the time.\nOperator: Your last question today comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Just curious on the auto sector, if you give a little color around that, what you are hearing from the OEMs, maybe how the parts business is doing and any update on the chip situation? Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. We certainly saw some improvement in the March and that\u2019s continued into April, when we started shipping cars without chips, I guess that helps. So some of that inventory that was sitting on the ground, waiting for chip to come in, they just decided to go ahead and ship it in maybe you don\u2019t have a sea warmer right now, but you will get it in maybe in six months from now. But -- so that we seeing a lot more finished good inventory on the ground and we are ramping up to deliver those products in the market. So that\u2019s -- but we will see what some of the impacts in China with some of the disruption there having over there with that, the variant running through there and Shanghai shutting down and some other areas, so it\u2019s a watch item, but we are seeing some favorability at least in the near-term.\nJordan Alliger: Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for attending. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jamie Boychuk",
            "content": "Thanks, Kevin. The safety of our operations will always be our first priority. Our concern for all of our employees, customers and the communities in which we live and operate drives us to make sure that we maintain the demanding standards of our safety focused culture. The results that you see on slide seven show this clearly. Over the first quarter, we saw sequential and year-over-year improvements in the number of injuries and train accidents, which brought their frequency rates to a near record low levels for the first quarter. We are happy to see this improvement. We continue to push forward with the initiatives that we described to you last quarter, actively coaching, safety awareness among our employees, encouraging best practice sharing across teams and expanding our application of technology, and we put a very strong emphasis on our efforts with our new hires to ensure that they respect and demonstrate the principles that make CSX an industry safety leader. Moving on to slide eight. For the last several quarters, you have heard us discuss the efforts we are making to address our staffing levels. This is a critical point, because our networks, capacity and fluidity will improve when we have enough trained conductors and engineers. When we have these resources, it lifts our service performance in the near-term, while also ensuring that we are ready to meet the substantial demand growth we anticipate in the years ahead. This slide also shows several important positive train and engine employee trends that reflect the hard work done by our recruiting and training teams. We have made great progress here and importantly, we are set up to build on the momentum we have created. First, you can see a strong ramp up in the number of T&E employees we have in our training program. We averaged over 500 daily employees in training over the first quarter, which is over 5 times where we were a year ago. We expect to keep our training classes full to make sure that our pipeline remains healthy. Second, we have successfully increased our run rate of conductors who are completing their training and marking up into the active T&E population. We now have roughly 100 employees marking up each month who are ready to haul freight, generate revenue and we expect this pace to continue. In the last chart, you can see the payoff, return in the corner and we are now adding to our active T&E count month-over-month. We have said it again and again, our aim is to grow this railroad, so that we need to bring good people in, train them the right way and deliver on service. It takes time, but this is exactly what we are doing. Now let's turn to slide seven, which gives us a picture on where our operations stand today. This quarter started off with several key challenges. The Omicron wave was hitting our employees, where the incident at our Curtis Bay facility and the East Coast suffered under severe weather in early February. So for the full quarter, our key metrics of trip line compliance, terminal car dwell and velocity were generally flat to slightly worse on a sequential basis. That said, as Jim highlighted in his remarks, early into the second quarter, we are seeing encouraging signs that these metrics are starting to move in the right direction. It's clearly too quick to call the bottom with certainty, but with the success of our hiring initiatives, and a continued drive for discipline and consistency in the field, we see reasons to be optimistic. Consistent with the last quarter, we have made the tactical decision to keep additional locomotives active in the near-term to help with network balance, while we remain short of employees in certain regions. As we successfully promote our new conductors, we will be focused on improving our asset utilization and driving efficiency as the additional crew resources facilitate higher volumes and improve service and reliability. As always, the key will be strong execution and I am excited at the level of higher engagement and enthusiasm that our operating team is bringing to this challenge. I am looking forward to showing what we can do over this next quarter, the rest of the year and the years to come. I will now hand it over to Sean to review the financial results. Well, good evening or good afternoon, Jon. For us, it's purely comes down to hiring numbers and getting more T&E folks where we need them. Kevin and I have been worked really closely with our customers to do everything we can to support those needs of our customers. And our customers are working with us in different areas with different solutions as we look at how we can turn cars quicker, whether it comes down to block loading by destination and other items that we have been working on for years and continuing to work with our customers that way, so we don't have to handle cars as much. But definitely, when we are looking at that pure number with respect to our trainees out there, we talked about having 500 or 500 trainings out there right now. We have qualified up to 400 already this year since the start of the year. So we have come a long way in that area and we continue to pull whatever levers we can with respect to the design, if there's cars we can move in different corridors that make more sense where our crew base has gotten healthier, we are doing that. But really as we continue to push forward here, the common theme that we know we will get our railroad back to where we need to is just continuing to train conductors. Our timing is, we are really shooting in towards the third quarter. As we push the number of employees, we have training right now, if those qualified and we continue to do our hiring of 30 to 40 every single week, puts us in a good position at some point in the third quarter, it might be towards the tail end of the third quarter. And then -- and to Jim's point, we are continuing to hire for attrition as attrition moves forward. We have seen attrition climb up and we got to make sure that we stay ahead of that throughout this year and then into next year and we have got many different programs that we want to continue to train locomotive engineers and other pieces. So we are not going to be stopping at any point in time here soon. But we feel pretty confident as long as the world doesn't throw us some type of a curveball again. Q3 is going to be a much better quarter for us."

            "name": "Jim Foote",
            "content": "Great. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you to everyone for again joining us on our call today. I will begin by expressing my thanks to all of CSX employees, who continue to put in tremendous efforts to serve our customers effectively and above all safely. I'd also like to welcome today, Steve Fortune, who's with us in the room here today in Jacksonville. Steve serves in a newly created role of Executive Vice President and Chief Digital and Technology Officer, and will focus on harnessing transformative technologies to further growth and enable continued efficiency across the business. His experience leading technology organizations at a global industrial company will be very helpful as we continue to transform CSX. Now moving to the quarter, we are pleased with our results this quarter, though we are not yet satisfied with our service performance. The effects of COVID and severe weather across much of our network clearly led to a tough start to the year. But as we moved into March, operating conditions began to gradually improve and we do see indications that this momentum is continuing. For over a year, we have communicated to you that the key to rebuilding our service to pre-pandemic levels is to hire more trained and engine service employees. I am pleased to say that our efforts there are progressing well and our active T&E count has moved steadily higher this year. The people and resources that we are putting in place today will allow us to provide reliable, efficient service to an expanding number of customers. The business environment remains very favorable for CSX, despite new uncertainties across global supply chains. We are dedicated to do our part to help our customers here in North America meet increasing demand, as business and consumers around the world look for reliable sources of the products that we transport. Meanwhile, domestic activity remains robust, and our business development and marketing groups are working hard to convert new opportunities. And as higher energy prices and increasing scrutiny on greenhouse gas emissions, highlight rails efficiency advantages over trucks, we are in a great position. If we all do our jobs, hold to our principles and deliver the service levels that we know we can achieve, this company has great potential for many years ahead. Lastly, I'd like to note that we are pleased with the Surface Transportation Board approved our acquisition of Pan Am Railways, which clears the way for the transaction to close this June. All of us are excited about the opportunities that will come as we design new service solutions for shippers and receivers in New England. Now let's turn to slide four. Turning to the presentation, which highlights our key financial results, we moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generated over $3.4 billion in revenue. Operating income increased by 16% to $1.28 billion. The operating ratio increased by 150 basis points to 62.4%. But remember, this range includes approximately 250 basis points of impact from quality carriers and the impact of higher fuel prices. And earnings per share increased 26% to $0.39 a share. I will now turn it over to Kevin, Jamie and Sean for details. Okay. So let's conclude with our outlook for the year as shown on slide 13. We continue to benefit from strong markets and ample customer demand, and we are adding employs the needs that our network can capture more of the business opportunities that are right in front of us. At the same time, we are of course keeping a close eye on inflation, interest rates and the fed. With support from higher coal prices and a supportive market environment, we feel comfortable projecting double-digit growth for both revenue and operating income for the full year. In the near-term, we expect to continue to benefit from elevated export coal prices and higher fuel surcharge revenue. Full year CapEx is planned at approximately $2 billion, which is also unchanged. We have made progress since the beginning of the year and we still have a lot of work to do, but we are committed to supporting our customers by providing them with reliable, efficient, cost effective rail solutions for their changing transportation needs. By adding the necessary resources and lifting our service levels, we will be well-positioned for years of profitable growth. Thanks and I will turn it back to Matthew. Yeah. Brandon, look, there's a lot of moving parts. Obviously, one, they get confidence and the hiring trajectory, and Jamie spoke to that, we are seeing good momentum as we get into April and we will move through the rest of the quarter. Obviously, some other factors have occurred. You have seen the export coal market remain really, really strong here and supportive, and we had assumed probably that market would tail off a little bit sooner than what is expected now. Also fuel surcharge has been a bigger factor going forward as well as oil prices have obviously moved up dramatically here with the Ukraine crisis going on. But the number of factors going, we still see the strong demand from all of our markets and we have competence that we are going to begin to capture more and more of that as we -- as fluidity picks up through the network. Yeah. I will cover the first one. Look, that's been our target. We want to outgrow the economy. There's a lot of moving parts, as you know, the auto business -- automotive business is going to be a big factor as we get in the second half and that business on production needs to recover there to really hit those GDP plus targets. So that's one market to look at. Coal, as well, we see strong demand there, but we will be watching that going forward. And then the intermodal market, particularly on the domestic side, we are assuming chassis and other drayage capacity comes back into the market and that will drive some incremental growth for us as well. So there's a few moving parts, but that's always our target and that's why we came out at the beginning of the year as we expect to exceed GDP volume growth, but realizing that there's a number of new moving parts going on right now. Well, I think, we have been going through since really the middle of 2018 divergence between the consumer economy and the industrial economy, whether it was driven by going back to the tariff issues that began to create concern amongst the industrial producers, and at the same time, you had a consumer economy that was going gangbusters. And that kind of carried forward into the pandemic years, let's call it, the plague years of 2020 and 2021 and industrial really got hammered, especially in still -- there's still lingering effects from that and it's a -- look at the automotive sector and the consumer economy went nuts. So, now, I think, you are starting to see those two divergent economies come back more in line and industrial demand is very good. Is it -- I think it's clear in our comments. We have not met the demand and as the railroad on the industrial side and the bulk side of the business, we have done a very -- I think we have done an amazing job in handling the consumer side of the business in the intermodal sector throughout the last couple of years. So the demand is there, as the railroad begins to continue to improve as we go forward, we see a lot of opportunity and there could be changes, while there are obviously -- obviously, there are going to be changes in various supply chains, whether it's import/export grain, whether it's continued demand for U.S. coal, steel, plastics, chemicals, you name it, everything is going to be moving around a little bit. But we see all of these sectors being assuming that everything in the world stays relatively sane, where we are today, if you don't want to call the sanity, a great environment for us to excel and the only reason we haven't achieved it in the last, nine months ago, I said that the numbers that we are talking about today, in terms of where we would be with hiring, that's where we thought we would be nine months ago. The extremely tight labor market and the higher -- somewhat higher attrition rates that we went through have held us back and so we have figured it out. We have done everything we could possibly do to take advantage of the situation. And I think the economy on both, especially so on the industrial side of the economy, where traditionally railroads have excelled looks favorable as we look forward. Well, in terms of what we left behind, I will use a term that Tom uses quite often lots and I will leave it at that. In terms of where we are going to be, from a timing standpoint, where we will get, but I will say, what Jamie mentioned earlier, we are going to continue to hire. We are going to manage this employee pipeline differently than we have in the past. We are going to make sure that lessons learned here that we are going to make sure that this doesn't happen to us again. And so that's why we are doing everything we can from an employee relations standpoint to work closer with our employees, because they are critical and key to what we want to do here and that is provide a reliable truck like product across all of our, well, truck likes reliability to all of our customers, because that's the key to the future for the company's growth. Jamie, do you want any color about timing. Just yeah and a little more color on that. It is easy for us to manage now. We have an attrition rate of around 7%. So we are not concerned with getting fat, because we can always manage down. What we have learned over the last year, year and a half is, it is extremely difficult. It is a completely different environment to try and add to the workforce. So we just have to look at it a little differently. That doesn't mean we are going to get fat and happy and have a bunch of employees that we don't need. That means that we are going to manage the workforce differently to make sure with the ebbs and flows of this business, which is always the case that we do it in a more -- in a different manner. So we don't get caught short like we just did. Well, I think, anybody that's followed the railroad business for a long time, like you have and everybody else on the call knows that the relationships between the railroads and the union workforce is not necessarily been one of mutual admiration and we need to fix that and we are working extremely hard. And throughout this process, we have, I mean, these guys were out there for two years in the middle of a pandemic working every single day and night in a chaotic operating environment caused by surges in traffic and you name it. And at the same time didn't get a raise. That's wrong in my opinion. And that's why we decided to do something about it unilaterally without asking for some kind of get back in the labor agreement. We just thought it was the right thing to do and so we made the offer and that's a change. It's not technology. It's relationship building with your unionized workforce and we need to change that and we are going to -- we are dedicated to changing that. And it is an ongoing long-term process, but CSX is committed to trying to do everything we can possibly do to change decades if not centuries of the somewhat dysfunctional relationship with our human workforce, that's the key and that's what this is all about. So we are not short of locomotives. We are not short of any physical infrastructure in order to be able to perform and that we continue to still have excess capacity across the railroad. There is one thing and one thing only that we are short of that is hampering us from doing the job that we want to do and to get back to the service levels where we were in 2019 and to get even better from that point on is we need more people in the engineer and conductor ranks. That's it. We don't need them anywhere else in the organization. We don't need more management people. We don't need a lot -- we don't need more people fixing the track and laying rail. They are doing a great job out there. We need more engineers and conductors, and that's it and that's what we are dedicated to do and that is why we will continue to focus on these numbers. And it is a lengthy process from the time we finally get someone, it is an extremely lengthy process from the time we start looking for somebody that in this day and age might want to be a railroad conductor until the time they have gone through the classroom. First of all, the pre-employment screening, then by the time they go through the month or more of classroom instruction and then six months on the job training and then we have to make sure at that point in time, they are equipped and ready to go out and work in a railroad operating environment and not get hurt and not hurt somebody else. It's a long, long process and that's why it has taken so long. As I said earlier, nine months longer, because of the front end of the process was not went away from us. The pipeline of normal candidate that might want to -- usually wanted to work in the railroad business, they don't want to go to work. They wanted to stay home. They wanted to do something else. And so we have had to revamp, work extremely hard and now we are beginning to realize the benefits of all that hard work and it's going to be month after month after month after month with these employees are then qualified, they actually go out and start performing work and as the year goes on, on a month-to-month-to-month basis, we will see continued improvements in fluidity and increases in the speed of the network, when the net -- so you have got a compounding effect. You are short of employees and you can't run the trains, so the network slows down. When the network slows down, you need more people. So we need to get the railroad back staffed, so that we can get the velocity and dwell down to where it was, that will then right-size our workforce to what we need and then we can more effectively manage it with the view that Kevin and his team provide us about where the opportunity is. Listen, they are not -- Kevin and his team are not shy about telling us on a regular basis where they see opportunity. It's out there. And we want to get it, we want to move it, because that's what we do and make a lot of money doing it. Well, I would hope, again, I hate to give projections, because I was already off by nine months on the last one. We will -- yeah, you will see Mr. Boychuk always gets nervous when I start making projections. I wonder railroad is going to start running better. The railroad will start running better in this quarter and it will get better in the third quarter and it will get better in the fourth quarter. And the operating performance of the company I hope then will continue to get better and better and better and better all the time. 2019 was not nirvana. 2019 is the base camp we want to get back to where we were which was record level of performance, but there was not where we were satisfied being the way we wanted to run the company and run the railroad. We wanted to get even better from there and we hopefully will be able to do that. But it's going to be a gradual improvement as we go through the remainder of this year. Well, I think, we are leading the industry in intermodal growth. So it is not in terms of volume. I think if not this year, next year for sure. In terms of volume, intermodal is going to be our biggest piece of business. That being said, so we want to -- we spent a lot of time and effort in 2017 and 2018 in re-engineering the way the intermodal network operated for reasons, so that we could have a good return on that business when we began to focus more intently on working in the key lanes where it makes sense for us to grow. We are beginning to I think have a better understanding of leveraging the East Coast ports, which have gone through a dramatic transformation in terms of growth versus the West Coast and have the much greater opportunity to expand that footprint in the East than they do in the West. And we are also working more and more and more at how we can participate in the Mexican intermodal market, which to-date we do basically nothing in. So whether it's international or domestic, the more players put asset towards the intermodal market, the more these markets further develop, we see great potential for us to continue to grow our intermodal franchise. That's not to say that we are in any way shape or form favoring that over the merchandise business. The merchandise business is a core part of our franchise. So we intend to grow both of these businesses. We see both of them as equal opportunity. Any business has a divergent book of business and so we don't -- we look at them both as exciting areas of opportunity. Again that's a different book of business. Personally I am more in favor of us being more involved on an asset ownership basis, because we see great opportunity there for potential and whether it's UMAX or whether it's every place else, I don't like the model where 95% of the work and get 75% of the money. So to the extent that we can turn some of this business around and make it more favorable to our bottomline, I can guarantee you that any kind of an investment in asset in that area would have a great return. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Jim. Turning to slide five. First quarter revenue increased 21% year-over-year, with growth across all major lines of business. Merchandise revenue increased 6% on 2% lower volume as strong pricing gains and higher fuel surcharge revenue more than offset the volume decline. Current demand remains strong across most merchandise markets, with shippers prioritizing environmental benefits of rail and pursuing lower cost options to offset inflation. The ongoing semiconductor shortage impacted automotive volumes through the quarter. However, we did see sequential improvement as consumer demand remains strong with dealer inventory levels low. Our core chemical franchise saw strong demand that more than offset continued challenges in energy-related chemical markets. As we continue to add resources across the network, we expect to capture additional opportunities. Intermodal revenue increased 13% on 1% lower volumes, as truck conversions drove domestic growth. Offsetting declines in the international market that continues to be impacted by supply side constraints. Intermodal demand remains strong, but continues to be challenged by takeaway capacity and equipment shortages including chassis. Coal revenue increased 39% on 10% lower volume. Export coals revenue increase was driven by higher benchmark prices, partially offset by lower domestic and international thermal coal shipments. First coal -- first quarter coal volumes were impacted by several factors, including mine disruptions in an outage at our Curtis Bay export facility. Demand across all of our coal markets remains strong and we expect volumes to improve in the second quarter, as some of these headwinds subside and additional network capacity is added. Other revenue increased primarily due to higher intermodal storage and equipment usage, but was partially offset by lower payments from customers that did not meet volume commitments. As we exit the quarter, concerns around the Omicron variant have been replaced by broader global supply chain uncertainty in the wake of the crisis in Ukraine. As Jim mentioned, we are committed to helping our customers. In North America meet the increasing demand for their products from consumers around the world. We are working closely with our customers to understand the potential shifts in the global supply chain. And while it is early, we see opportunities that could benefit our network and the port's we serve. As we look across many of our markets, demand continues to outstrip supply. We expect this to improve as resources are added across the supply chain. Now turning to slide six. I'd like to provide more detail on CSX's business development capabilities, which I briefly discussed last quarter. CSX has an experienced team of business development professionals to help existing and prospective customers identify, design and build facilities across the network. This team works closely with state and local economic developers to maximize investment incentives that will encourage more businesses to locate on CSX and our short line partners. These efforts continue to pay off. In 2021, over 90 new facilities and expansion projects were placed into service across our network, which represents over $3 billion of customer investment. Additionally, there are over 500 projects currently in an industrial pipeline. We are excited to work with these customers and provide them with efficient and reliable rail service that will enable them to grow their business for years, while creating significant long-term value for CSX shareholders. Most recently VinFast, the electric vehicle subsidiary of the large Asian conglomerate Vingroup announced that they will build a $4 billion electric vehicle assembly plant and battery manufacturing facility served exclusively by CSX. The team is proud to be part of North Carolina's first car plant in the largest economic development announcement in the state's history. This announcement is an excellent example of the kind of customer solutions that the team can deliver, as sales and marketing works closely with operators. The team is working diligently to direct even more customers to CSX by Select Site program. CSX Select Sites feature nearly 10,000 acres of premium certified rail serve sites to full scale industrial development and expansion. We are working to add even more sites to this program in 2022. I will now pass it on to Jamie to discuss our operations. No. I think this is largely -- some of our -- on the met side, some of the contracts are capped. So they don't fully to participate in these extreme prices. So this is probably a good run rate, assuming that core prices stay at those current levels they are today. Hey. This is Kevin. I -- when you look at what's happening right now, certainly I think Sean spoke to it. We would expect some of the storage fees and those things that come down to more normalized level. But that's a good thing. That means that supply chain is becoming more fluid. I mean we are moving more freight with the rail network that's exactly what we want to happen and so from that perspective that's all good. When we looked at where we are today versus where we were last quarter when we had this call, inflation is gone up even more and we are having to have those conversations with our customer. We re-price about 50% to 60% of our business every year and we are having those conversations, because our customers are having those conversations with their customers. And so that's the environment we are in, so there is a bit of a lag when you think about pricing and realization of that we are have to realize through the year and we fully expect that those things will start to deliver as we move through the year. Yeah. Sure. In terms of trade flows, what I was referring to there is, probably two issues. One I touched on the second slide that I covered we are seeing a lot more activity in terms of industrial re-shoring, more appetite for companies look at their supply chain. And quite frankly, supply chain resiliency is a competitive advantage now and companies are re-evaluating, do I want my production in Asia or do I wanted to overseas or would it be more appropriate to have an onshore closer to the consumers that are going to be buying the products and I am hopeful and we are seeing early signs, that's the case that they are making those decisions and spending capital behind it. The second one and this is extremely early and we are having a lot of conversations with customers, and Jim talked about this a little bit is, when you think about things like grain, which have largely huge amounts of supply of come out of the Ukraine and Russia and the Europe and other commodities and steel products and other things that are largely gone in the European market. Well, all of a sudden doesn't look like that's going to happen and some of those things that we had traditionally moved out of the West Coast to supply Asia. Now maybe that's going to come out of the East Coast and benefit the ports that we serve. And again it's really, really early. We have to have conversations. We have to make sure that the capabilities are there to be able to deliver those products when that demand happens. So we are staying very, very close to the customer. Understanding what could potentially move from the West Coast potentially into the East Coast and working with them and being really dynamic in terms of how we think about it. That's what I am thinking about. We are looking at everything that's going out the ports today and how that could change over the next few months and it's probably, it's not a next month phenomenon, it's probably six months, nine months, 12 months from now, we are going to really start to see some impact if it happens."

            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie, and good afternoon. Our focus is on profitable growth and despite the challenges we faced in the quarter, we delivered $600 million of revenue gains, with operating income of 16%. Interest expense and other income were a combined $11 million favorable and the effective tax rate for the quarter was 23.9%. Earnings per share of $0.39 reflects growth in core earnings, as well as the impact of our ongoing share repurchase program. Turning to the next slide. Total costs increased $419 million or 24% in the quarter, but we are in line with our expectations outside of the spike in fuel price. The acquisition of Quality Carriers represented approximately $215 million of expense. Higher fuel prices were also a significant factor, up about $110 million versus last year. All other expenses increased approximately $95 million, driven by inflation, as well as ongoing costs related to supply chain congestion and network fluidity. Turning to the specific line items, labor and fringe expense increased $72 million or 12% in the quarter. We invested $10 million more to onboard new train and engine employees, and we expect similar training costs next quarter, as we continue to convert our strong new hire pipeline. Quality Carriers drove about $35 million in additional labor expense. Incentive compensation increased $6 million, while inflation and other impacts drove just over $20 million of higher costs. Purchased services and other expense increased $203 million or 43% in the quarter. Quality Carriers represented approximately $140 million of PS and other expense. Costs incurred to maintain terminal and network fluidity added roughly $45 million of expense in the quarter similar to last quarter's impact. These costs are likely to persist into the second quarter and we expect to see improvement in the back half of the year, corresponding to labor and supply chain normalization. Additionally, a legacy environmental reserve adjustment drove $17 million of higher expense in the quarter. Depreciation and amortization was up $15 million or 4% higher asset base that also includes the quality impact. Finally, fuel expense increased to $141 million or 74%, reflecting a steep increase in highway diesel fuel prices, as well as the addition of non-locomotive fuel used for trucking. The rapid rise in fuel prices created approximately $45 million of fuel lag in the quarter. And lastly, the company recognized $27 million of real estate gains in the quarter, including $20 million related to the Virginia transaction. As a reminder, we expect to recognize the $120 million Virginia gain in the second quarter and receive the final $125 million cash payment in the fourth quarter. Now turning to cash flow on slide 12. Free cash flow before dividends increased on higher earnings to $976 million. Our highest priority use of cash is investing for the long-term reliability and growth of our railroad. After fully funding these capital projects, first quarter shareholder returns exceeded $1.2 billion, including approximately a $1 billion in buybacks and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our buyback approach as we continue to return excess cash to our shareholders. Finally, we are excited to close the Pan Am deal on June 1st. Pan Am will contribute about 1 point of annualized revenue, primarily within merchandise. Due to transaction and integration costs, Pan Am will have a negligible impact on earnings this year and the capital we expect to invest to upgrade to Pan Am network is already contemplated in our guidance. We look forward to working with Pan Am and its customers to drive continued growth through our integrated rail network. With that, let me turn it back to Jim for his closing remarks. And Justin, this is Sean. Just to add on with the OR question, I think it's -- as we have always said, the -- we expect the incremental margins on the growth to be very strong and very healthy, and that will be supportive in terms of the OR for the year. But there are some things to keep in mind that will be offsets, obviously, the quality impact, which will have the full impact of it in the first half of the year, given that the acquisition occurred in Q3 of last year. Higher fuel prices are essentially neutral to op income, but they do have a negative impact on the operating ratio as well. And then, obviously intermodal storage as things normalize, that will have an impact on the OR, particularly in the second half of the year, given that the storage revenues were quite elevated in the second half of last year. Yeah. Scott, to your -- first part of your question, I mean, remember, we are -- with all we are doing in hiring, we are netting up roughly 1% a quarter on a sequential basis. So that that -- the cumulative impact of that is a couple of percent year-over-year in headcount by the time we get to the second half of the year, and yeah, I think we ought to be able to grow in excess of that. We have got capacity on trains and in the network. We have got locomotives to move the freight. So we should be able to outpace it in terms of growth. And then in terms of your question on the cost side, those training costs are -- it's up $10 million versus last year, so call it, roughly $15 million a quarter that we are spending on training right now. I don't see that going away. Like, Jim just said, we are going to continue to hire. So that's probably pretty reasonable across the balance of the year. The piece that is probably more variable is the $45 million or so that we mentioned in purchase services and others. Most of which is really related to supply chain congestion, whether it be costs related to intermodal container yards and terminal labor, outsource labor or whether it be related to having more locomotives than we would otherwise need if the network were running faster, there's also an impact to rent. So think about it in terms of that roughly $45 million is the opportunity to kind of get back to where we were once we get this thing spinning. Yeah. I think when you look at some of the discrete items that I pointed out in the first quarter, we think some of those obviously are going to go away as we get through the year and then Jamie talked a lot about the additional resources we are adding and I think there are opportunities as the mines reinvest and they are making a lot of money right now and that allows them to reinvest in probably some deferred capital that they have had over the years. You would see some -- probably some better production coming out of those as well. So all else equal, if the market stays strong, we would anticipate some volume upside through the year. No. No. When you look at Southern utilities, oh, sorry, yeah, I didn't address that when you look at our Southern utilities and even our Northern Utilities right now they are at low levels. And so there is an inventory replenishment that needs to happen that we are working diligently on and working closely with them the -- and with the mines to make sure that happens into the summer peak season. And then on the export side, that is then obviously very, very robust in terms of the demand. You are now seeing some -- probably some thermal opportunities with supply not there coming out of Russia and so we will see how that materializes. Right now, it's not a lack of demand, it's a supply constrained market and you have seen the coal producers probably favor that export met business rather than the thermal business. And Curtis Bay, you will see that. Jamie, just remind me that will come on in the third quarter and I will offer some additional opportunity as that comes back on the full capacity. Yeah. We certainly saw some improvement in the March and that's continued into April, when we started shipping cars without chips, I guess that helps. So some of that inventory that was sitting on the ground, waiting for chip to come in, they just decided to go ahead and ship it in maybe you don't have a sea warmer right now, but you will get it in maybe in six months from now. But -- so that we seeing a lot more finished good inventory on the ground and we are ramping up to deliver those products in the market. So that's -- but we will see what some of the impacts in China with some of the disruption there having over there with that, the variant running through there and Shanghai shutting down and some other areas, so it's a watch item, but we are seeing some favorability at least in the near-term."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  I will now turn the conference over to your host, Matt Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Matt, you may begin.\nMatt Korn : Thank you, Krista. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Now in the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosures on Slide 3.  And with that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs. \nJoe Hinrichs : Alright, thank you, Matthew, and hello everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. As you will hear from our leadership team today, we are very happy with the momentum we carried in the start of the New Year. Of course, Mother Nature gave us a few challenges over the last couple of weeks, but we are proud of the work our ONE CSX team has done to set us up for success this year.  Our railroad is performing well and Mike Cory and the operations team are already bringing new ideas that are helping us run even better, safer and more efficiently. Our customers are happy with the consistent service that our dedicated employees are delivering and Kevin Boone will discuss how this is translating into profitable business opportunities. Sean Pelkey will go over our financial position, which remains very strong as we continue to deliver healthy volumes, favorable pricing, strong operating margins, and high levels of free cash flow.  Before we talk about the details of the past quarter and our expectations for 2024, it is important to take a step back to appreciate all that our ONE CSX team accomplished in 2023. Everyone on this call knows it's been a very active period for our entire industry. Recall that it was just over a year ago that Congress took action to prevent a major rail strike. Soon afterwards, highly visible events last winter led to important public debates about railroad safety. And through the year, Class I railroads have completed major mergers and made significant leadership changes. Meanwhile, our customers have had to manage through higher interest rates and inflation on the one hand, and wars and supply chain disruptions on the other.  Through all of this, the aim of our ONE CSX team has been to keep moving forward on our key goal of delivering sustainable, profitable growth that benefits to all our key stakeholders, our customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities we live in and serve. For example, CSX was the first Class I railroad to reach basically agreements with our union partners, and we were the first railroad to significantly change our attendance policies based on employee feedback. We were also the first U.S. Class I railroad to be released and additional service metric reporting by the STB back in May, based on our improvements and service to our customers.  Now here on slide five, we have listed several key achievements from this past year, and helped us take important steps forward. First and foremost, our focus on safety has driven strong results over the year, especially in the fourth quarter, enabling us to report much improved accident and injury rates compared to 2020. Our service metrics that have consistently led the industry. And today CSX remains ahead of our peers. Importantly, this is improving our customers\u2019 experience, which puts us in a great position to gain their trust and gain share.  You've heard me reiterate this all year long, our team delivered positive volume growth in merchandise that beat U.S. industrial production, improved efficiency helped us grow coal volumes, and our intermodal business gained traction led by our service and market initiatives. Our commercial and operating teams are more closely aligned than ever. Our customers know that when we offer them a solution, we have the commitment and the expertise to deliver it.  Finally, we have seen our efforts to renew the culture here the railroad start to really take shape. Through our site visits family days, and our regular surveys and town halls, we see the increased pride and energy that our employees are feeling through ONE CSX. And this is great progress. And we are proud of what we've accomplished this past year. None of these efforts are done or complete as this is a journey. There's so much more that we can accomplish as we work together as ONE CSX team.  On Slide 6, we highlight some of the key results from our fourth quarter. Total volume grew by 1%, reaching 1.56 million units in the quarter. Much of this growth was driven by our strong merchandise franchise, which gained 3% year-over-year. Our total revenue decreased by roughly 1%, 3.68 billion as the effects of higher volumes and favorable pricing were offset by a decrease in other revenue and lower fuel surcharge due to lower diesel prices, as compared to last year. We earned $0.45 per share, compared to 49% -- $0.49 per share a year ago.  With that. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Cory to go over the details of our operations.\nMike Cory : Yeah, thank you, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to Slide 8 and let's just go to the Q4 recap. As I've said many times before, safety is foundational to every success we have. We saw a reduction in engineering and mechanical related accidents and a reduction in transportation injuries during the quarter. And I really want to thank every CSX employee for their continued efforts on creating a safe working environment for themselves and each other and that is extremely important.  But we know we still have worked to do well. Though the full year numbers showed overall improvement, we were flat on transportation related accidents, and saw an increase in engineering related accidents. These are all areas of opportunities we aim to improve in 2024 and beyond. Safety at its core isn't solely about incidents, it's about how employees feel working within the organization. We have an environment where employees feel included, respected, valued and listened to, we can continue to identify areas of improvement as a team and change them.  In 2023 we listened to our employees and we made positive changes to the work environment in response, converting these conversations in sound successful practices. Our results are beginning to demonstrate that this is already making a difference but we have a ways to go. We'll continue to keep this dialogue open and learn from each other.  When done right, the entire ones CSX team will meet its great potential when it comes to operating safely and efficiently and service to our customers. Over the next slide, and on this slide is pretty self-explanatory to me. It shows we've stabilized our network and we've performed pretty well over the quarter. While one of our key focus areas is on maintaining and bettering our customer facing metrics.  Our fluidity has started to allow us to look deeper at our operating plan, again to better align the hard assets needed to move the volume. The team's been focused on maximizing car connections and maximizing the train load, while at the same time reducing locomotive dwell and active horsepower on trains. As a result, we've seen both the reduction in active locomotive use and daily train start.  Tighten connections standards in our yards are starting to drive changes to our operating plan that result in quicker connections. Driving a strong focus on using our locomotive technology to reduce fuel usage on line of road has contributed to a savings overall fuel cost. Altogether, we're finding tangible opportunities to open up more capacity on this network. I expect these metrics to continue to improve as we go forward.  Moving over to Slide 10. And I really believe we've made good headway in Q4 and especially over 2023. Our key metrics continue to improve in our network fluid. Our headcount is at the point that we're now able to manage through efficiency and attrition. We\u2019re paying close attention to resource requirements for any new business coming online when needed. Our focus on car connections and train tonnage closely matched horsepower along with network fluidity allowed us to reduce 2.5% of our daily starts in the quarter and start to store active locomotives.  Among other things, this coming quarter, we'll be performing full territory reviews with our team that will further improve our customer service and continue to identify opportunities to better align asset use. And of course, we'll be working right along with Kevin and his sales and marketing team to deliver this great service and grow with our customers.  During closing, during my four months on the property, I continue to learn more about this network and especially the women and men that make up this tremendous ONE CSX team. I'm extremely excited about our potential to deliver our customers better service with greater safety, efficiency and teamwork.  I'm excited to do this together as one group of great railroaders. So thanks for the time. Over to you, Kevin.\nKevin Boone : Thank you, Mike. It really has been great to see how well our teams have been working together and the positive momentum we are building with our customers, as they recognize CSX\u2019s focused on service. The teamwork is allowing us to build on new opportunities and drive attractive and profitable growth across all of our end markets. Business conditions in 2023 were challenging for many of our customers, with some of our key markets experiencing volatility driven by a number of factors, including inventory destocking.  On the positive side, we saw many of these markets show improvement in the fourth quarter, which combined with our industry-leading service provides optimism that the team can deliver strong revenue growth.  Turning to Slide 12, look at our merchandise performance. As you can see, our revenues were up 5% on both a quarterly and annual basis. Even with the effects of reduced fuel surcharge. Volume increased by a solid 3% for the quarter, and 2% for the full year -- excuse me, outpacing domestic industrial production that's been effectively flat. And we've delivered pricing results that reflect the higher inflationary backdrop that we've all experienced.  Looking at the details of the quarter, automotive performed well, even with a temporary disruption caused by the UAW strike, as total volumes held up and we continue to see leverage, and we continue to leverage service to gain new business. Chemicals was challenged over most of the year, but delivered positive growth in the fourth quarter driven by shipments in plastics, sand and waste. For fertilizers, strong domestic demand and higher CSX shipments of potash exports supported volumes. Short haul phosphate shipments remains constrained by supply issues, which weighs on volumes but provides a tailwind for yields.  Metals has continued to be an area where our service provided growth opportunities. And in minerals, infrastructure related demand continue to be very healthy over the quarter, with new cement production supporting volumes. For forest products volumes was modestly lower year over year, but increased sequentially, as cardboard demand has started to show signs of recovery. While the ramp up in ag and food over the fourth quarter was challenged, with southeastern feed buyers remaining well supplied from local crops, combined with slower ramp up in exports.  Now, as we head into 2024 we are encouraged with the momentum we built across the business and we see many opportunities across the end markets we serve. Our Service continues to differentiate CSX in the marketplace, and we are excited about the opportunities this offers us to work with customers to collectively grow our businesses together.  Turning to Slide 13. Coal revenue decreased 1% for the fourth quarter as we lapped very strong export pricing from a year ago. Volumes remained positive, growing by 3% for the quarter, and 8% for the year. Our coal business continues to be strong, with service levels accelerating in the fourth quarter, and global export prices supporting U.S. production. At the end of the last quarter, we indicated that export demand remained strong that lower natural gas prices and reduced restocking demand would likely weigh on domestic shipments. And that's exactly what happened in the fourth quarter, with export tonnage up a full 27% while domestic tonnage declined by 13%. Coal RPU of just over 3,200 per ton was up 5% sequentially in line with our expectations.  For the New Year, we are optimistic, supported by continued strength and export demand, as global benchmarks for both met and thermal we currently remain at half healthy levels. We also see incremental production growth on our network in West Virginia, which will primarily be focused on the export market.  Domestic demand in 2023 was supported by months of aggressive restocking at utilities and a very hot summer. With stockpiles at more normal levels demand upside will largely be dependent on weather conditions in 2024. That said, total electricity demand growth remains substantial, especially in the Southeast, driven by new industrial capacity to data centers, achieving EV charging stations.  Turning to Slide 14. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue decreased 4% on flat volumes. For the full year, revenue decreased 11% on volumes that were down 7%. Lower fuel surcharge drove the largest impact to yields. Our domestic intermodal business continued to perform well, with volume increasing sequentially and growing in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We saw growth with our key partners that continue to experience industry-leading service performance, which was recently highlighted in JOCs customer satisfaction results.  Our ability to deliver domestic growth was an extraordinary team effort, especially given the significant challenges facing the trucking market. In International, volumes were lower compared to last year, but we were encouraged to see improvement each month with December actually showing modest year-over-year growth as the positive effects of more normalized retailer inventories gain traction. Our team has continued to work hard to maximize our opportunities, which showed up in the growth as we work to build new partnerships, create new service offerings and leverage higher activity at the inland ports that we serve.  Positive market trends are taking shape as we head into 2024, and we expect the combination of a more supportive market, new conversion opportunities and service offerings to drive year-over-year growth in both the domestic and the international business. We continue to monitor the evolving situations at both the Panama Canal and the Red Sea. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any changes in our customer behavior but we stand at the ready with the capacity and capabilities to adapt as needed. Finally, as we turn the page to 2024, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. The team is accelerating our efforts in many areas of our business to work hand-in-hand with our customers to identify areas for growth. From industrial development to identifying market-specific operating metrics that enhance the customer experience. Team has been working closely with our rail partners to unlock growth. These are just a few of the focus areas for the team.  Now I'll hand it over to Sean to review the financial review.\nSean Pelkey : Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 10% or $139 million. Now these results include $180 million of discrete year-over-year impacts from declines in other revenue, real estate gains and export coal benchmark prices. However, the underlying results also reflect the benefit of our sustained service levels throughout 2023 and growing momentum in the business. Across merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel increased by 5%, benefiting from strong core pricing across the merchandise portfolio and 3% volume growth in both merchandise and coal. Counter to normal seasonal trends, the team delivered sequential volume gains, helping operating income increased by $25 million relative to the third quarter. Interest and other expense was $16 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $23 million, the effective tax rate of 22.9% included $19 million of favorable adjustments primarily for state tax matters relative to $33 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year. Our expected tax rate going forward remains 24.5%. Earnings per share fell by $0.04, including $0.07 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. For the full year, operating income fell by 8% or $462 million, while earnings per share was 5% lower. These results were impacted by the prior year Virginia real estate transaction declining intermodal storage revenue and lower export coal benchmarks totaling nearly $700 million on a combined basis.  The hard work of our ONE CSX team provided our customers reliable and consistent service throughout 2023, and laid a strong foundation for long-term profitable growth. With profitable growth in mind, we will also be making a change in how we report results going forward. Starting in the first quarter of 2024 and we will transition to a more conventional approach of reporting operating margins rather than operating ratio. Our goal is to target margin improvement, aligning the business around a balanced approach that includes profitable volume gains and pricing to the value of our service, all while controlling costs and optimizing asset utilization.  Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expenses. Total fourth quarter expense increased by $89 million as the impacts of lower real estate gains, inflation, increased depreciation and higher head count were partly offset by lower fuel prices and efficiency savings in PS&O and rents.  Turning to the individual line items. Labor and Fringe was up $82 million, impacted by inflation and additional headcount. The quarter also included costs that related to the timing of union employee vacation and sick benefits. We expect this to adjust down resulting in a lower sequential cost per employee in the first quarter.  Purchased services and other expense increased $4 million versus last year, as inflation was mostly offset by savings from our intermodal and engineering teams. We expect a modest sequential increase in the first quarter, similar to what we have seen in recent years. As a reminder, we'll cycle a prior year insurance recovery of nearly $50 million in the first quarter. And while we expect increased technology carry costs and a need for more locomotive overhauls to impact expense in 2024, we are actively implementing cost savings and efficiency initiatives that will help offset these headwinds.  Depreciation was up $24 million, including an $11 million adjustment related to prior periods. We are projecting roughly $40 million to $50 million higher full year depreciation expense in 2024. Fuel cost was down $59 million driven by a lower gallon price. While fuel efficiency was stable year-over-year, we saw strong sequential improvement. These results are especially encouraging as we typically face seasonal efficiency headwinds in the fourth quarter. Mike and the team expect to continue the momentum in this critical measure into 2024 and drive meaningful year-over-year savings.  Equipment and rents was $9 million favorable, driven by faster car cycle times across all markets. Finally, property gains were $47 million unfavorable in the quarter. At this time, we do not expect any individually significant transactions during 2024.  Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 18. Full year free cash flow remains strong at $3.3 billion. Our first priority use of cash remains investing for the safety, reliability and growth of our business. As such, this figure includes $2.3 billion of capital spend across a wide range of projects to ensure the integrity of our network infrastructure as well as the high return strategic investment opportunities.  Looking to 2024, note that free cash flow will be impacted by about $380 million of Federal Cash Tax Payments that were deferred from 2023. Cash flow generation also supported close to $4.4 billion in shareholder returns for the year, including $3.5 billion in share repurchases and nearly $900 million of dividends. While economic profit finished lower for the year, largely due to lower intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing, our goal is to increase economic profit over time which has been shown to strongly correlate with outsized shareholder returns.  With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoe Hinrichs : All right. Thank you, Sean. Now we will conclude with our initial thoughts on our expectations for the full year 2024. As of today, and based on our visibility with our customers and our expectations for the CSX specific initiatives that we are putting in place, we anticipate growth in total volume and total revenue in the low to mid-single digit range. We see encouraging momentum across our merchandise business, but we are benefiting from service-led gains in market share and wallet share and new industrial development activity. We expect growth in our intermodal business as a prolonged destocking cycle finally winds down and our strategic initiatives continue to drive volume, and Export coal demand continues to be very strong with CSX gaining from the ramp-up of a new mine on our network. By growing volumes and utilizing our existing capacity, we expect our profitability to benefit from a favorable combination of solid pricing better operational efficiency and a moderate easing in cost inflation. Kevin's team continues to do a great job making sure that we are getting paid for the service we provide. And as Mike discussed, we see all kinds of new opportunities run this network better, safer, faster and more efficiently.  We expect an increase in our capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion this year as we invest in safety infrastructure, locomotive rebuilds, upgrades to our portion of the New Alabama Interchange with CBKC and other specific high-return investments, including technology investments. Finally, as before, there is no change to our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns, using our excess cash to fund share repurchases and dividends to benefit our shareholders.  In closing, I am very proud of what our entire team accomplished this past year. To our ONE CSX team, I want to thank all of you across all of our facilities in every state and province that we're operating in, through your hard work and for demonstrating that our ONE CSX culture can be something real and impactful. We're in a great position we had in 2024 and with your help, we can make it even better year than the strong one we just had.  For everyone on this call, thank you for all your interest in and support of CSX. Matthew, we're now ready to take questions.\nMatt Korn : Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Krista, we're ready to start the process.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Chappell: Thank you and good afternoon. Sean, I wanted to dig a little deeper on this part of the guide and maybe some of the delayed productivity improvements that you spoke about. If the volume commentary is low to mid-single digit, you have some of the productivity levers that you were hoping to pull even though you have some of these, I guess, other fixed cost increases in the form of D&A, et cetera. How do you think about margin expansion in 2024 based on your base case of volume and revenue?\nSean Pelkey : Thanks, Jonathan. That's a bit of a loaded question, a lot in there. Well, I'll do my best. I think when I step back our target is to always expand margins, and we can do that by growing the business profitably, operating safely and running an efficient railroad.  When I think about 2024 and sort of how that year progresses, we built some momentum coming from Q3 into Q4. We grew volumes. We grew operating income. That's not always the case. Our hope is to continue that momentum going into the first quarter, whether or not withstanding here. And then build that momentum into the second quarter as well. We've got some headwinds year-over-year that we can talk about in the first quarter. They began to ease in the second quarter. And then by the time we get to the second half of the year, the comps are a little bit easier, and that's where I think you'll really see some very strong incremental margins.\nJohn Chappell: Thanks, Sean. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead. Your line is open. \nBascome Majors : Joe, you opened the call talking about a lot of the progress you had made in your first year leading the business. Can you talk about how your focus or at least investors will see your focus involved over the next 12 to 18 months following the success you've had improving a lot of stakeholder relationships in your first 16?\nJoe Hinrichs : Yeah. Thanks, Bas. And I think you heard a little bit of that in, on the commentary from the team here. We now see our business has stabilized. We've reached a threshold on customer service that has been recognized in the industry, and now you're seeing the opportunity for us to take advantage of that stability to get more efficient.  We're now at the manpower levels that we were targeting. There's always going to be some needs here or there. But generally speaking, we're the manpower levels we were targeting. So we head into 2024 with an opportunity to be in a much more stable setting the momentum we're building on culture and how people are working together. Mike coming in and his perspective and working closely with Kevin and his team, I feel really good about the opportunity going forward now is for us to leverage the strength we have in our operating model and the people we have to get more efficient.  Obviously, we want to see more safety improvement this year as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and building momentum there, and then take advantage of the opportunity to grow with our customers. We now have over a year of providing stable, persistent, reliable service that our customers are recognizing us for. And we have the opportunity now to talk to each one of them about, okay, what can we do together to grow and how can we work together? The journey on efficiency, safety, culture never ends, and we're going to keep working together. But I will tell you, we come into 2024, our network was in good shape, very good shape. Our manpower levels are in good shape. The team is working better together than I\u2019ve seen it in the time I\u2019ve been here. And so that gives us confidence that we can build on the momentum we\u2019ve established over the last year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Oseenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck : Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just a quick follow-up for Sean first. Can you just give us the commentary about the comp per employee stepping down into the first quarter after the increase in 4Q? And then maybe for Mike, can you just give us a sense in terms of what you're seeing? I know it's still little bit early, but a little bit further down the path over the last call, it sounds like fuel efficiency is an area for some big improvement that you're targeting. Maybe some more network in taking out some of the locomotives as the fluidity continues to improve. So what are you seeing there and maybe some rough order of magnitude would be helpful? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey : Sure, Brian. I'll begin on the copper employees. So we did have some true-ups in terms of vacation and sick leave that I mentioned in the quarter. That was probably about $15 million. We also had work that moved from capital into OE. We typically have that in the fourth quarter. So those will both be tailwinds going into the first quarter on comp per employee. So I would expect if you're modeling that a couple of percentage point improvement versus what we reported in Q4. Should be pretty steady in the first half. And then again, we have that 4% wage increase scheduled in July, so probably step up a little bit in the second half of the year. Notwithstanding the efficiency initiatives that Mike and the team are focused on.\nOperator: Your next question --\nMike Cory : Sorry. I was just going to finish up. Look, overall asset use, whether it's locomotives, trains we run, how productive all of us are, they're front and center for what we look at. And so for me, it's really, I'd say out of a scale out 1 to 10, I'm about a 4 in terms of where I am in understanding our network and understanding our people. However, we're really starting to focus in on the things that aren't working right. They aren't working against what we think we can do with the franchise, with the network we have. So whether it's size of trains, the state of the train, the use of the technology we have to get the most out of the locomotive. It's just, right now, it's blocking and tackling, and it's everybody coming together. So we're learning, we're teaching we're sharing best practices. We're doing the things that, in that fourth quarter was really the last couple of months that we really started to see the things we could do because, first of all, we had the head count. We had the reliability and the fluidity of the network.  And so we\u2019re just going to keep grinding that stone. But as I said in my remarks, we\u2019re going to really get deep into the operating plans over every corridor over the next few quarters. And I\u2019ll leave that charge, but I tell you what, I\u2019ve got a lot of people that are that are out there ready to go and they\u2019re very qualified to do this. So I see, to Sean\u2019s point, we got further efficiency ahead of us, but never at the expense of safety and never at the expense of customer service. So our hope is that we continue to provide this great product and the customers are going to come. And that\u2019s how we\u2019ll also get the efficiency that we need.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJustin Long : Thanks, good afternoon. So with the 2024 guidance being the same for volumes and revenue, low to mid-single digit growth. Is it right to think that your assumption for revenue per unit all-in is flattish? And either way, I was wondering if you could provide some more color on your expectations for coal RPU maybe for the first quarter and then the full year as well? Thanks. \nKevin Boone : Hey, Justin, this is Kevin. I think you hit on it right there on the coal RPU. Obviously, very healthy market right now, how much you embed that going forward? We're optimistic, but we know this market can move around quite a bit. And so maybe a little bit of conservative outlook as we move through the year. Hopefully, there's some upside to that, but that's largely impacting it, as you mentioned, from an RPU perspective.  The other thing that I would highlight is we do expect the intermodal market to bounce back here, and that's a lower RPU business as well, but that will be contributory to our growth this year from a volume and revenue perspective. So lower ARPU overall. So that will mix it down a bit. But those are the two large factors that you just highlighted and you know about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nScott Group : Hey, thanks, afternoon. So I want to just dig into the cost side a little bit. So if I just look, I understand some noise with vacations and paid sick but cost ex fuel up about 3% to 4% from Q3 with volume up less than 1%. So it's just, we've seen a lot of cost creep that continued in Q4. I guess, ultimately, I'm trying to figure out where do we go from here? Can we start to see overall cost levels stabilize? Do they still increase, but increase just at a slower pace? Is there any chance they could start to come down a little bit? I don't know. I'm just struggling with how to think about the cost side. So any help there?\nSean Pelkey : Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I can take a stab at it here. So I think fourth quarter, let's remember, we've got the dynamic of some work moving off of capital and going to OE. That's normal. We'll typically see a little bit of a step-up that reverses back in Q1.  We probably had, call it, $30 million, $35 million of costs in the quarter that were somewhat unusual items that we mentioned but just as a reminder, we had a true-up on vacation and sick leave, that was about $15 million, as I just mentioned. We had another $10 million on depreciation true-up at the end of the year there for that, that's not going to recur. And then the Livingston, Kentucky derailment was about $10 million as well. So you kind of add all that together, those costs roll off as we go into the first quarter.  And then we built some momentum. I mean, as Mike said, he\u2019s already looked at the train plan. He\u2019s reduced some starts driving tonnage up. That\u2019s going to drive fuel efficiency as well, taking some locomotives out. We\u2019re not paying maintenance on those locomotives. So we\u2019re certainly building some momentum. I think that\u2019s going to gradually add in as we go through the year. And that\u2019s why I feel really good about where the incrementals are going to be second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz : Yeah, good afternoon. Wanted to ask, I think it's probably for Kevin, just a little bit on the revenue side. You've had a pretty meaningful storage revenue headwind in 2023. And I think you feel surcharge can be an impact too. How do you think about those two factors as you go in '24? Are they kind of neutral? Or is there still some lingering headwind?  And then in terms of price, what kind of a price assumption do you have? Are you thinking stable pricing versus what we got in '23? Or is it kind of up or down? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey : Yeah. So just on the first part of the question, Tom, I'll answer that. On the other revenue piece, we're, I would go ahead and model something like $130 million a quarter, which is kind of what we've been running at the second half of this year. Obviously, you do the math on that, it will be a big headwind in Q1 about, call it, $50 million plus. That's why the comps are tougher in Q1 and then a little less in Q2 before we get to the normalized rate.  And then on fuel, don't forget, we had a pretty favorable lag impact in the first half of last year to the tune of almost $70 million across the first and second quarter. So prices have come down a little bit. We are expecting somewhat favorable lag in Q1 of this year, but it's still be a year-over-year headwind. So those are two reasons why we're thinking about more sequential momentum in the first quarter as opposed to being able to deliver growth until we get to the second half of the year.\nKevin Boone : Yeah. And then on pricing, I think, as we talked about all last year, we had to react to a much higher inflation environment that we all experienced, quite frankly. And, you'll see a lot of that carryover, right? These contracts are negotiated some on a multiyear period, some year-over-year. We know how to negotiate every year. So it's fair to say our expectation coming into '24 is cost inflation for our business will be a little bit lower. So I would expect that number to come down when we have our conversations but still very healthy when you look at historical rates, what we were able to achieve. And obviously, that's an important part of our revenue growth story is both volume balanced approach between volume and price.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey, good evening, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, I wonder if you could speak more specifically to labor efficiency this year, especially in reference to Kevin's remarks that you're going to have new merchandise business bringing on about a point of volume additionally. So how are you planning for headcount? And what are the opportunities for efficiency there? Thank you.\nMike Cory : Hey, Brandon, I hope you're well. Look, I'm not going to say at this stage that we can add incremental volume without headcount. It depends on what it is and where it's at. But I'm very comfortable with the results we had in a run rate of more train size. And that obviously reduces the impact on the headcount. We've got areas that we just haven't got to in my time yet. And I think the -- and this isn't just about trade and size, but we really, we have a very customer-intensive network. And so we have a lot of yards and locals and first of all, we're looking to button down and make the service reliable.  And with the head count we have right now, we see that we're able to do it. So that leads us to know that we can do better. And so I see the opportunities really in the touches of the cars that we do today. So I see further incremental improvement. I see the ability with the capacity we're creating with the locomotives that we've got added to the storage count to the capacity we created online by having less movements. I see us being able to handle incremental volume with what we have in many cases. But again, there are those key areas we want to make sure that we have the right head count for.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter : Great, good afternoon. So just, I guess, thinking about the performance there, either Mike or Joe, it looked like your on-time origination is down at 71% on-time arrivals at 69%. What is still missing from the operations to get that efficiency improving? Have you changed the categories at all to see those sliding since the beginning of the year? Maybe just what are your thoughts on how that gets increased efficiency to get those additional operating leverage savings?\nMike Cory : Yeah, thanks, Ken. It just goes back to what I'm talking about in our yards and our terminal performance, and that's where our focus will be. Again, I've been getting the folks to really focus on connecting cars, increasing train size. So we're going through some growth periods in that sense. Yeah, it's affecting the on-time performance. But at the end of the day, we're counting on making sure we fulfill the trip plan of the customer, and in some cases, it's going to change the way we design our network and the time the trains go.  So I'm not concerned about that at this stage. It certainly isn't anything to do with congestion or poor performance. These are the growing, the growth what I call, growth observations of a network that's starting to change and really look to more maximize the assets that we have out there to create capacity. So it\u2019s not a cause of concern at this moment. Trust me, we look at it in a lot, measured at the minute. So this isn\u2019t, it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve got trains that are late, late, late. These are fractions of hours. And so that\u2019s fine. We know we have to operate on time. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s the delivery to the customer. It\u2019s their first mile, last miles, their pain points that we\u2019re focused on. And at the same time, we\u2019re driving efficiency through running a more condensed network.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee : Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe I just wanted to follow up on the Resources question. I guess, as you think about the portfolio of the business opportunities ahead of you that informs the volume growth outlook. Can that be done? Or what are the resources required, I guess, as you think about the plans? When we think about headcount, maybe specifically, but maybe also locomotives, what is the growth associated with that that you guys have in the plan for 2024?\nSean Pelkey : Yeah. I mean, Chris, one thing to just think about is we added head count through the year in 2023, right? So if we just held everything flat to where we ended the year last year, would be up 2% year-over-year with a little bit more of that year-over-year growth in the first half than in the second half.  I think our view right now is that, by and large, with a couple of exceptions, we should be able to hold head count flat and absorb the new growth that's coming on in the network. And so we'll be able to do that. First quarter, it won't look like tremendous employee efficiency just because we added through the year last year, we get into the second half of the year. I think that's where you're going to see the labor productivity show up.\nMike Cory : Yeah. And just on top of that, too, Chris. Staying with locomotives, where we still have opportunity to use the locomotives we have out there working, use them harder. And so that\u2019s a big focus for us, whether it\u2019s dwell, whether it\u2019s connection, whether it\u2019s what they\u2019re pulling, I believe we have the capacity to grow just of what we have out there right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mahrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAmit Mehrotra : Thanks, Operator. Hi, everybody. So, Sean, can you just help us, I guess, calibrate 1Q expectations in terms of operating ratio. You talked about $30 million to $35 million of kind of one-timers in the fourth quarter. I think that's like a point of OR. Volume is down, I guess, a little over 6%. So that's obviously a headwind weather is tough. So just talk about that.  And then on the cost side, PS&O costs, there's a lot of focus on labor. Again, it's your biggest cost bucket, but PS&O is a pretty large bucket. And if I look over the last three to four years, the rate of inflation in PS&O costs are like more than double revenue growth. What's going on there? What's the opportunity to kind of hold the line or bring that down? Because if I remember correctly, back in '17- '18 was really a great place to look for efficiency and opportunity. I just want to know if there's an opportunity there in '24 as well.\nSean Pelkey : Amit, on your Q1 margin question, I think I'll just sort of stick to what I said before in terms of building momentum from Q4 to Q1. That's our goal. It's to deliver if we can, operating income growth sequentially from Q4 to Q1. The margins will be what they are based on what, where fuel prices settle. But can we grow margins as well in Q1. Sure. I think that's within the realm of possibility.  Again, whether or notwithstanding, we had a rough couple of weeks we're coming out of that, things are certainly looking better across the network as we speak. So you'll see the weekly volumes and see how that catches up from there.  In terms of your comment on PS&O, I think it's a good reminder for everybody to go back and understand we added quality carriers a couple of years ago, a significant portion of the expenses within quality shows up in the PS&O line. And that is quite volume variable. And so, as we see increases or decreases in the trucking revenue line, that's going to impact PS&O expense as well.  We also added PanAm. There are PS&Operator expenses associated with the revenue that we added across that part of the network as well. And then PS&Operator can also be somewhat volume driven, particularly on the intermodal side, the terminal related expenses show up there on that line. So what I said was going from Operator4 to Operator1 on PS&Operator like we normally do, we would expect a little bit of a sequential increase in those costs and have no doubt, we are certainly focused on that line item amongst others as an area of opportunity to continue to drive cost savings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good evening. I just want to go back to the commentary on domestic intermodal specifically around truck conversion. It does seem like we're still really early stages. I would love to get your perspective on what can drive that acceleration in some of those conversions? Is it your reliability improving further? Is it better truck capacity? Just anything, any comments there on what could drive that acceleration of the space at this point?\nKevin Boone : Yeah. I would think, I've heard many characterize last year as maybe the worst trucking market they've seen in the last 40 years. So I think there's a lot of hope that we're at the bottom or have reached the bottom. I will say, and we've been recognized and I highlighted this in the opening comments, the customers are seeing the service levels that we're delivering. And I know Mike has plans to even improve some of our true terminal fluidity even further.  We're looking at ways where we're going to measure the customer experience in a different way. Measure their truck on time terminal and all those things that really are important for those customers that drive value for their customers, quite frankly. So a lot of those initiatives are underway, and that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward through the year that not only hopefully the market has bottomed, but on top of that, that we\u2019re going to be able to gain share with the service product that we\u2019re able to deliver.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So Sean, I think you called out, I think it was like $280 million or $380 million of deferred tax headwinds and $300 million of extra CapEx. I just want to confirm I got that $600 million headwind to cash flow rate for the year?  And then as we think about timing, Sean, you were very clear about incrementals being better in the back half than the front half. Kevin, can you share anything on the rate at which you'd expect this single, low to mid-single digit sort of volume and revenue to show up? Is that also back-end loaded? Or how do we think about the cadence for the year? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey : Yeah, David, I'll start. So on your question there, Yeah. So deferred tax, $380 million, which was essentially a benefit to 2023. We will make that payment in the first half of 2024. And then on the CapEx, basically going from 2.3 to 2.5 million, so that's about a $200 million increase on that side.\nKevin Boone : Yeah. In terms of the cadence from a volume and revenue perspective, I think we've been clear in that first quarter, some coal dynamics, other things from a pricing perspective or probably the high watermark that we'll have to lap, but pretty even cadence through the year after that. You'll probably remember, we started to see some weakness into the second quarter on the industrial side of our business.  And when you think about chemicals and our forest products business, in particular, some very strong, weakness that started to occur that we were, that will begin the lap quite frankly, as we get into the second quarter, late second quarter and third and fourth. So, but when we look across the year, we think we\u2019re able to achieve growth throughout the year.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker : Guys, just got only one. Maybe just a follow-up on that, kind of just on the operating leverage itself, I mean in theory, shouldn't we be seeing kind of the bulk of the operating leverage kind of show up now as we come off the floor of volumes and kind of you have the maximum fixed cost absorption? And kind of the follow-up question to that is, if the market stays softer for longer in 2024, and truck rates continue to be competitive, do you think the volumes that you guys are converting will be enough to drive that operating leverage? Or do you also need price to come on top of that?\nSean Pelkey : Yeah, Ravi. So on the operating leverage point, I would say that the leverage is there underlying the business, right? We've had some discrete headwinds that I mentioned in the script. And as we go into the first half of this year, Q1, you got fuel lag from last year, you have other revenue coming down. You've got an insurance recovery. Those are things that we're going to have to lap and get behind us and then a little bit of a tail into Q2 as well, which is why in the second half, on a reported basis, you'll see it show up a lot more cleanly. In terms of the macro, I think, yeah, we feel pretty confident about our ability to grow even in the face of a macro that's relatively flat. We have some business wins that are carryover, got some new business that's coming online, and we should be able to absorb most of that with the existing resources, if not tighten up the plan a little bit and save some costs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin : Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wanted to go back to the coal forecast. I know you mentioned in your remarks here that domestic coal is expected to be modestly impacted. And when we're comparing it to other sources, EIA, you're saying U.S. production is going to be down 16% in 2024, and that's on the back of solar and the retirement of coal-fired capacity. Is this just a different market? Like is the retirement of coal-fired capacity just not in your catchment area? Is it, what would lead to such a disparity between that kind of forecast and the one that you're providing here on the domestic coal front?\nKevin Boone : Yeah, Walter, we all read your notes here. Obviously, we've been intimately looking at that, and we have our own sources. But we do a bottoms-up build up, right? We look at, we talk to our customers. We understand what the demand they're seeing in their business, how they're forecasting, what they're telling their investors and their stakeholders in terms of what they're seeing. And quite frankly, this market right now is still a production -- production is going to either decide our upside or limit our upside. It's not, we don't see a demand -- demand right now where it is impacting our volumes next year. It's really a production-constrained market from everything that we're seeing.  We see some weakness in the domestic market. We think there is an export market that can continue to put some of that volume into that market. So there is optimism. Obviously, I know this market can change quite quickly. The global environment changes quickly. But for what we see right now and what our customers are telling us, and, there will be some weather impact as we get into the year, we'll look at the summer to see if it's hotter than usual or where that shakes out, that will obviously impact our domestic business, but we do think there's an export business that as an outlet for some of the domestic side if we saw some further weakness there.\nOperator: We have no further questions in our queue.

            "name": "Joe Hinrichs",
            "content": "Alright, thank you, Matthew, and hello everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. As you will hear from our leadership team today, we are very happy with the momentum we carried in the start of the New Year. Of course, Mother Nature gave us a few challenges over the last couple of weeks, but we are proud of the work our ONE CSX team has done to set us up for success this year.  Our railroad is performing well and Mike Cory and the operations team are already bringing new ideas that are helping us run even better, safer and more efficiently. Our customers are happy with the consistent service that our dedicated employees are delivering and Kevin Boone will discuss how this is translating into profitable business opportunities. Sean Pelkey will go over our financial position, which remains very strong as we continue to deliver healthy volumes, favorable pricing, strong operating margins, and high levels of free cash flow.  Before we talk about the details of the past quarter and our expectations for 2024, it is important to take a step back to appreciate all that our ONE CSX team accomplished in 2023. Everyone on this call knows it's been a very active period for our entire industry. Recall that it was just over a year ago that Congress took action to prevent a major rail strike. Soon afterwards, highly visible events last winter led to important public debates about railroad safety. And through the year, Class I railroads have completed major mergers and made significant leadership changes. Meanwhile, our customers have had to manage through higher interest rates and inflation on the one hand, and wars and supply chain disruptions on the other.  Through all of this, the aim of our ONE CSX team has been to keep moving forward on our key goal of delivering sustainable, profitable growth that benefits to all our key stakeholders, our customers, our employees, our shareholders and the communities we live in and serve. For example, CSX was the first Class I railroad to reach basically agreements with our union partners, and we were the first railroad to significantly change our attendance policies based on employee feedback. We were also the first U.S. Class I railroad to be released and additional service metric reporting by the STB back in May, based on our improvements and service to our customers.  Now here on slide five, we have listed several key achievements from this past year, and helped us take important steps forward. First and foremost, our focus on safety has driven strong results over the year, especially in the fourth quarter, enabling us to report much improved accident and injury rates compared to 2020. Our service metrics that have consistently led the industry. And today CSX remains ahead of our peers. Importantly, this is improving our customers' experience, which puts us in a great position to gain their trust and gain share.  You've heard me reiterate this all year long, our team delivered positive volume growth in merchandise that beat U.S. industrial production, improved efficiency helped us grow coal volumes, and our intermodal business gained traction led by our service and market initiatives. Our commercial and operating teams are more closely aligned than ever. Our customers know that when we offer them a solution, we have the commitment and the expertise to deliver it.  Finally, we have seen our efforts to renew the culture here the railroad start to really take shape. Through our site visits family days, and our regular surveys and town halls, we see the increased pride and energy that our employees are feeling through ONE CSX. And this is great progress. And we are proud of what we've accomplished this past year. None of these efforts are done or complete as this is a journey. There's so much more that we can accomplish as we work together as ONE CSX team.  On Slide 6, we highlight some of the key results from our fourth quarter. Total volume grew by 1%, reaching 1.56 million units in the quarter. Much of this growth was driven by our strong merchandise franchise, which gained 3% year-over-year. Our total revenue decreased by roughly 1%, 3.68 billion as the effects of higher volumes and favorable pricing were offset by a decrease in other revenue and lower fuel surcharge due to lower diesel prices, as compared to last year. We earned $0.45 per share, compared to 49% -- $0.49 per share a year ago.  With that. I'll now turn the call over to Mike Cory to go over the details of our operations. All right. Thank you, Sean. Now we will conclude with our initial thoughts on our expectations for the full year 2024. As of today, and based on our visibility with our customers and our expectations for the CSX specific initiatives that we are putting in place, we anticipate growth in total volume and total revenue in the low to mid-single digit range. We see encouraging momentum across our merchandise business, but we are benefiting from service-led gains in market share and wallet share and new industrial development activity. We expect growth in our intermodal business as a prolonged destocking cycle finally winds down and our strategic initiatives continue to drive volume, and Export coal demand continues to be very strong with CSX gaining from the ramp-up of a new mine on our network. By growing volumes and utilizing our existing capacity, we expect our profitability to benefit from a favorable combination of solid pricing better operational efficiency and a moderate easing in cost inflation. Kevin's team continues to do a great job making sure that we are getting paid for the service we provide. And as Mike discussed, we see all kinds of new opportunities run this network better, safer, faster and more efficiently.  We expect an increase in our capital spending to approximately $2.5 billion this year as we invest in safety infrastructure, locomotive rebuilds, upgrades to our portion of the New Alabama Interchange with CBKC and other specific high-return investments, including technology investments. Finally, as before, there is no change to our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns, using our excess cash to fund share repurchases and dividends to benefit our shareholders.  In closing, I am very proud of what our entire team accomplished this past year. To our ONE CSX team, I want to thank all of you across all of our facilities in every state and province that we're operating in, through your hard work and for demonstrating that our ONE CSX culture can be something real and impactful. We're in a great position we had in 2024 and with your help, we can make it even better year than the strong one we just had.  For everyone on this call, thank you for all your interest in and support of CSX. Matthew, we're now ready to take questions. Yeah. Thanks, Bas. And I think you heard a little bit of that in, on the commentary from the team here. We now see our business has stabilized. We've reached a threshold on customer service that has been recognized in the industry, and now you're seeing the opportunity for us to take advantage of that stability to get more efficient.  We're now at the manpower levels that we were targeting. There's always going to be some needs here or there. But generally speaking, we're the manpower levels we were targeting. So we head into 2024 with an opportunity to be in a much more stable setting the momentum we're building on culture and how people are working together. Mike coming in and his perspective and working closely with Kevin and his team, I feel really good about the opportunity going forward now is for us to leverage the strength we have in our operating model and the people we have to get more efficient.  Obviously, we want to see more safety improvement this year as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year and building momentum there, and then take advantage of the opportunity to grow with our customers. We now have over a year of providing stable, persistent, reliable service that our customers are recognizing us for. And we have the opportunity now to talk to each one of them about, okay, what can we do together to grow and how can we work together? The journey on efficiency, safety, culture never ends, and we're going to keep working together. But I will tell you, we come into 2024, our network was in good shape, very good shape. Our manpower levels are in good shape. The team is working better together than I've seen it in the time I've been here. And so that gives us confidence that we can build on the momentum we've established over the last year."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. It really has been great to see how well our teams have been working together and the positive momentum we are building with our customers, as they recognize CSX's focused on service. The teamwork is allowing us to build on new opportunities and drive attractive and profitable growth across all of our end markets. Business conditions in 2023 were challenging for many of our customers, with some of our key markets experiencing volatility driven by a number of factors, including inventory destocking.  On the positive side, we saw many of these markets show improvement in the fourth quarter, which combined with our industry-leading service provides optimism that the team can deliver strong revenue growth.  Turning to Slide 12, look at our merchandise performance. As you can see, our revenues were up 5% on both a quarterly and annual basis. Even with the effects of reduced fuel surcharge. Volume increased by a solid 3% for the quarter, and 2% for the full year -- excuse me, outpacing domestic industrial production that's been effectively flat. And we've delivered pricing results that reflect the higher inflationary backdrop that we've all experienced.  Looking at the details of the quarter, automotive performed well, even with a temporary disruption caused by the UAW strike, as total volumes held up and we continue to see leverage, and we continue to leverage service to gain new business. Chemicals was challenged over most of the year, but delivered positive growth in the fourth quarter driven by shipments in plastics, sand and waste. For fertilizers, strong domestic demand and higher CSX shipments of potash exports supported volumes. Short haul phosphate shipments remains constrained by supply issues, which weighs on volumes but provides a tailwind for yields.  Metals has continued to be an area where our service provided growth opportunities. And in minerals, infrastructure related demand continue to be very healthy over the quarter, with new cement production supporting volumes. For forest products volumes was modestly lower year over year, but increased sequentially, as cardboard demand has started to show signs of recovery. While the ramp up in ag and food over the fourth quarter was challenged, with southeastern feed buyers remaining well supplied from local crops, combined with slower ramp up in exports.  Now, as we head into 2024 we are encouraged with the momentum we built across the business and we see many opportunities across the end markets we serve. Our Service continues to differentiate CSX in the marketplace, and we are excited about the opportunities this offers us to work with customers to collectively grow our businesses together.  Turning to Slide 13. Coal revenue decreased 1% for the fourth quarter as we lapped very strong export pricing from a year ago. Volumes remained positive, growing by 3% for the quarter, and 8% for the year. Our coal business continues to be strong, with service levels accelerating in the fourth quarter, and global export prices supporting U.S. production. At the end of the last quarter, we indicated that export demand remained strong that lower natural gas prices and reduced restocking demand would likely weigh on domestic shipments. And that's exactly what happened in the fourth quarter, with export tonnage up a full 27% while domestic tonnage declined by 13%. Coal RPU of just over 3,200 per ton was up 5% sequentially in line with our expectations.  For the New Year, we are optimistic, supported by continued strength and export demand, as global benchmarks for both met and thermal we currently remain at half healthy levels. We also see incremental production growth on our network in West Virginia, which will primarily be focused on the export market.  Domestic demand in 2023 was supported by months of aggressive restocking at utilities and a very hot summer. With stockpiles at more normal levels demand upside will largely be dependent on weather conditions in 2024. That said, total electricity demand growth remains substantial, especially in the Southeast, driven by new industrial capacity to data centers, achieving EV charging stations.  Turning to Slide 14. Fourth quarter intermodal revenue decreased 4% on flat volumes. For the full year, revenue decreased 11% on volumes that were down 7%. Lower fuel surcharge drove the largest impact to yields. Our domestic intermodal business continued to perform well, with volume increasing sequentially and growing in the mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. We saw growth with our key partners that continue to experience industry-leading service performance, which was recently highlighted in JOCs customer satisfaction results.  Our ability to deliver domestic growth was an extraordinary team effort, especially given the significant challenges facing the trucking market. In International, volumes were lower compared to last year, but we were encouraged to see improvement each month with December actually showing modest year-over-year growth as the positive effects of more normalized retailer inventories gain traction. Our team has continued to work hard to maximize our opportunities, which showed up in the growth as we work to build new partnerships, create new service offerings and leverage higher activity at the inland ports that we serve.  Positive market trends are taking shape as we head into 2024, and we expect the combination of a more supportive market, new conversion opportunities and service offerings to drive year-over-year growth in both the domestic and the international business. We continue to monitor the evolving situations at both the Panama Canal and the Red Sea. To date, we have not been significantly affected by any changes in our customer behavior but we stand at the ready with the capacity and capabilities to adapt as needed. Finally, as we turn the page to 2024, I'm excited about the opportunities ahead. The team is accelerating our efforts in many areas of our business to work hand-in-hand with our customers to identify areas for growth. From industrial development to identifying market-specific operating metrics that enhance the customer experience. Team has been working closely with our rail partners to unlock growth. These are just a few of the focus areas for the team.  Now I'll hand it over to Sean to review the financial review. Hey, Justin, this is Kevin. I think you hit on it right there on the coal RPU. Obviously, very healthy market right now, how much you embed that going forward? We're optimistic, but we know this market can move around quite a bit. And so maybe a little bit of conservative outlook as we move through the year. Hopefully, there's some upside to that, but that's largely impacting it, as you mentioned, from an RPU perspective.  The other thing that I would highlight is we do expect the intermodal market to bounce back here, and that's a lower RPU business as well, but that will be contributory to our growth this year from a volume and revenue perspective. So lower ARPU overall. So that will mix it down a bit. But those are the two large factors that you just highlighted and you know about. Yeah. And then on pricing, I think, as we talked about all last year, we had to react to a much higher inflation environment that we all experienced, quite frankly. And, you'll see a lot of that carryover, right? These contracts are negotiated some on a multiyear period, some year-over-year. We know how to negotiate every year. So it's fair to say our expectation coming into '24 is cost inflation for our business will be a little bit lower. So I would expect that number to come down when we have our conversations but still very healthy when you look at historical rates, what we were able to achieve. And obviously, that's an important part of our revenue growth story is both volume balanced approach between volume and price. Yeah. I would think, I've heard many characterize last year as maybe the worst trucking market they've seen in the last 40 years. So I think there's a lot of hope that we're at the bottom or have reached the bottom. I will say, and we've been recognized and I highlighted this in the opening comments, the customers are seeing the service levels that we're delivering. And I know Mike has plans to even improve some of our true terminal fluidity even further.  We're looking at ways where we're going to measure the customer experience in a different way. Measure their truck on time terminal and all those things that really are important for those customers that drive value for their customers, quite frankly. So a lot of those initiatives are underway, and that gives us a lot of confidence as we move forward through the year that not only hopefully the market has bottomed, but on top of that, that we're going to be able to gain share with the service product that we're able to deliver. Yeah. In terms of the cadence from a volume and revenue perspective, I think we've been clear in that first quarter, some coal dynamics, other things from a pricing perspective or probably the high watermark that we'll have to lap, but pretty even cadence through the year after that. You'll probably remember, we started to see some weakness into the second quarter on the industrial side of our business.  And when you think about chemicals and our forest products business, in particular, some very strong, weakness that started to occur that we were, that will begin the lap quite frankly, as we get into the second quarter, late second quarter and third and fourth. So, but when we look across the year, we think we're able to achieve growth throughout the year. Yeah, Walter, we all read your notes here. Obviously, we've been intimately looking at that, and we have our own sources. But we do a bottoms-up build up, right? We look at, we talk to our customers. We understand what the demand they're seeing in their business, how they're forecasting, what they're telling their investors and their stakeholders in terms of what they're seeing. And quite frankly, this market right now is still a production -- production is going to either decide our upside or limit our upside. It's not, we don't see a demand -- demand right now where it is impacting our volumes next year. It's really a production-constrained market from everything that we're seeing.  We see some weakness in the domestic market. We think there is an export market that can continue to put some of that volume into that market. So there is optimism. Obviously, I know this market can change quite quickly. The global environment changes quickly. But for what we see right now and what our customers are telling us, and, there will be some weather impact as we get into the year, we'll look at the summer to see if it's hotter than usual or where that shakes out, that will obviously impact our domestic business, but we do think there's an export business that as an outlet for some of the domestic side if we saw some further weakness there."

            "content": "Thanks, Kevin, and good afternoon. Fourth quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 10% or $139 million. Now these results include $180 million of discrete year-over-year impacts from declines in other revenue, real estate gains and export coal benchmark prices. However, the underlying results also reflect the benefit of our sustained service levels throughout 2023 and growing momentum in the business. Across merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel increased by 5%, benefiting from strong core pricing across the merchandise portfolio and 3% volume growth in both merchandise and coal. Counter to normal seasonal trends, the team delivered sequential volume gains, helping operating income increased by $25 million relative to the third quarter. Interest and other expense was $16 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $23 million, the effective tax rate of 22.9% included $19 million of favorable adjustments primarily for state tax matters relative to $33 million of favorable adjustments in the prior year. Our expected tax rate going forward remains 24.5%. Earnings per share fell by $0.04, including $0.07 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. For the full year, operating income fell by 8% or $462 million, while earnings per share was 5% lower. These results were impacted by the prior year Virginia real estate transaction declining intermodal storage revenue and lower export coal benchmarks totaling nearly $700 million on a combined basis.  The hard work of our ONE CSX team provided our customers reliable and consistent service throughout 2023, and laid a strong foundation for long-term profitable growth. With profitable growth in mind, we will also be making a change in how we report results going forward. Starting in the first quarter of 2024 and we will transition to a more conventional approach of reporting operating margins rather than operating ratio. Our goal is to target margin improvement, aligning the business around a balanced approach that includes profitable volume gains and pricing to the value of our service, all while controlling costs and optimizing asset utilization.  Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at fourth quarter expenses. Total fourth quarter expense increased by $89 million as the impacts of lower real estate gains, inflation, increased depreciation and higher head count were partly offset by lower fuel prices and efficiency savings in PS&O and rents.  Turning to the individual line items. Labor and Fringe was up $82 million, impacted by inflation and additional headcount. The quarter also included costs that related to the timing of union employee vacation and sick benefits. We expect this to adjust down resulting in a lower sequential cost per employee in the first quarter.  Purchased services and other expense increased $4 million versus last year, as inflation was mostly offset by savings from our intermodal and engineering teams. We expect a modest sequential increase in the first quarter, similar to what we have seen in recent years. As a reminder, we'll cycle a prior year insurance recovery of nearly $50 million in the first quarter. And while we expect increased technology carry costs and a need for more locomotive overhauls to impact expense in 2024, we are actively implementing cost savings and efficiency initiatives that will help offset these headwinds.  Depreciation was up $24 million, including an $11 million adjustment related to prior periods. We are projecting roughly $40 million to $50 million higher full year depreciation expense in 2024. Fuel cost was down $59 million driven by a lower gallon price. While fuel efficiency was stable year-over-year, we saw strong sequential improvement. These results are especially encouraging as we typically face seasonal efficiency headwinds in the fourth quarter. Mike and the team expect to continue the momentum in this critical measure into 2024 and drive meaningful year-over-year savings.  Equipment and rents was $9 million favorable, driven by faster car cycle times across all markets. Finally, property gains were $47 million unfavorable in the quarter. At this time, we do not expect any individually significant transactions during 2024.  Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 18. Full year free cash flow remains strong at $3.3 billion. Our first priority use of cash remains investing for the safety, reliability and growth of our business. As such, this figure includes $2.3 billion of capital spend across a wide range of projects to ensure the integrity of our network infrastructure as well as the high return strategic investment opportunities.  Looking to 2024, note that free cash flow will be impacted by about $380 million of Federal Cash Tax Payments that were deferred from 2023. Cash flow generation also supported close to $4.4 billion in shareholder returns for the year, including $3.5 billion in share repurchases and nearly $900 million of dividends. While economic profit finished lower for the year, largely due to lower intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing, our goal is to increase economic profit over time which has been shown to strongly correlate with outsized shareholder returns.  With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Thanks, Jonathan. That's a bit of a loaded question, a lot in there. Well, I'll do my best. I think when I step back our target is to always expand margins, and we can do that by growing the business profitably, operating safely and running an efficient railroad.  When I think about 2024 and sort of how that year progresses, we built some momentum coming from Q3 into Q4. We grew volumes. We grew operating income. That's not always the case. Our hope is to continue that momentum going into the first quarter, whether or not withstanding here. And then build that momentum into the second quarter as well. We've got some headwinds year-over-year that we can talk about in the first quarter. They began to ease in the second quarter. And then by the time we get to the second half of the year, the comps are a little bit easier, and that's where I think you'll really see some very strong incremental margins. Sure, Brian. I'll begin on the copper employees. So we did have some true-ups in terms of vacation and sick leave that I mentioned in the quarter. That was probably about $15 million. We also had work that moved from capital into OE. We typically have that in the fourth quarter. So those will both be tailwinds going into the first quarter on comp per employee. So I would expect if you're modeling that a couple of percentage point improvement versus what we reported in Q4. Should be pretty steady in the first half. And then again, we have that 4% wage increase scheduled in July, so probably step up a little bit in the second half of the year. Notwithstanding the efficiency initiatives that Mike and the team are focused on. Yeah. Thanks, Scott. I can take a stab at it here. So I think fourth quarter, let's remember, we've got the dynamic of some work moving off of capital and going to OE. That's normal. We'll typically see a little bit of a step-up that reverses back in Q1.  We probably had, call it, $30 million, $35 million of costs in the quarter that were somewhat unusual items that we mentioned but just as a reminder, we had a true-up on vacation and sick leave, that was about $15 million, as I just mentioned. We had another $10 million on depreciation true-up at the end of the year there for that, that's not going to recur. And then the Livingston, Kentucky derailment was about $10 million as well. So you kind of add all that together, those costs roll off as we go into the first quarter.  And then we built some momentum. I mean, as Mike said, he's already looked at the train plan. He's reduced some starts driving tonnage up. That's going to drive fuel efficiency as well, taking some locomotives out. We're not paying maintenance on those locomotives. So we're certainly building some momentum. I think that's going to gradually add in as we go through the year. And that's why I feel really good about where the incrementals are going to be second half of the year. Yeah. So just on the first part of the question, Tom, I'll answer that. On the other revenue piece, we're, I would go ahead and model something like $130 million a quarter, which is kind of what we've been running at the second half of this year. Obviously, you do the math on that, it will be a big headwind in Q1 about, call it, $50 million plus. That's why the comps are tougher in Q1 and then a little less in Q2 before we get to the normalized rate.  And then on fuel, don't forget, we had a pretty favorable lag impact in the first half of last year to the tune of almost $70 million across the first and second quarter. So prices have come down a little bit. We are expecting somewhat favorable lag in Q1 of this year, but it's still be a year-over-year headwind. So those are two reasons why we're thinking about more sequential momentum in the first quarter as opposed to being able to deliver growth until we get to the second half of the year. Yeah. I mean, Chris, one thing to just think about is we added head count through the year in 2023, right? So if we just held everything flat to where we ended the year last year, would be up 2% year-over-year with a little bit more of that year-over-year growth in the first half than in the second half.  I think our view right now is that, by and large, with a couple of exceptions, we should be able to hold head count flat and absorb the new growth that's coming on in the network. And so we'll be able to do that. First quarter, it won't look like tremendous employee efficiency just because we added through the year last year, we get into the second half of the year. I think that's where you're going to see the labor productivity show up. Amit, on your Q1 margin question, I think I'll just sort of stick to what I said before in terms of building momentum from Q4 to Q1. That's our goal. It's to deliver if we can, operating income growth sequentially from Q4 to Q1. The margins will be what they are based on what, where fuel prices settle. But can we grow margins as well in Q1. Sure. I think that's within the realm of possibility.  Again, whether or notwithstanding, we had a rough couple of weeks we're coming out of that, things are certainly looking better across the network as we speak. So you'll see the weekly volumes and see how that catches up from there.  In terms of your comment on PS&O, I think it's a good reminder for everybody to go back and understand we added quality carriers a couple of years ago, a significant portion of the expenses within quality shows up in the PS&O line. And that is quite volume variable. And so, as we see increases or decreases in the trucking revenue line, that's going to impact PS&O expense as well.  We also added PanAm. There are PS&Operator expenses associated with the revenue that we added across that part of the network as well. And then PS&Operator can also be somewhat volume driven, particularly on the intermodal side, the terminal related expenses show up there on that line. So what I said was going from Operator4 to Operator1 on PS&Operator like we normally do, we would expect a little bit of a sequential increase in those costs and have no doubt, we are certainly focused on that line item amongst others as an area of opportunity to continue to drive cost savings. Yeah, David, I'll start. So on your question there, Yeah. So deferred tax, $380 million, which was essentially a benefit to 2023. We will make that payment in the first half of 2024. And then on the CapEx, basically going from 2.3 to 2.5 million, so that's about a $200 million increase on that side. Yeah, Ravi. So on the operating leverage point, I would say that the leverage is there underlying the business, right? We've had some discrete headwinds that I mentioned in the script. And as we go into the first half of this year, Q1, you got fuel lag from last year, you have other revenue coming down. You've got an insurance recovery. Those are things that we're going to have to lap and get behind us and then a little bit of a tail into Q2 as well, which is why in the second half, on a reported basis, you'll see it show up a lot more cleanly. In terms of the macro, I think, yeah, we feel pretty confident about our ability to grow even in the face of a macro that's relatively flat. We have some business wins that are carryover, got some new business that's coming online, and we should be able to absorb most of that with the existing resources, if not tighten up the plan a little bit and save some costs."

            "name": "Mike Cory",
            "content": "Yeah, thank you, Joe. And good afternoon, everyone. Let's go to Slide 8 and let's just go to the Q4 recap. As I've said many times before, safety is foundational to every success we have. We saw a reduction in engineering and mechanical related accidents and a reduction in transportation injuries during the quarter. And I really want to thank every CSX employee for their continued efforts on creating a safe working environment for themselves and each other and that is extremely important.  But we know we still have worked to do well. Though the full year numbers showed overall improvement, we were flat on transportation related accidents, and saw an increase in engineering related accidents. These are all areas of opportunities we aim to improve in 2024 and beyond. Safety at its core isn't solely about incidents, it's about how employees feel working within the organization. We have an environment where employees feel included, respected, valued and listened to, we can continue to identify areas of improvement as a team and change them.  In 2023 we listened to our employees and we made positive changes to the work environment in response, converting these conversations in sound successful practices. Our results are beginning to demonstrate that this is already making a difference but we have a ways to go. We'll continue to keep this dialogue open and learn from each other.  When done right, the entire ones CSX team will meet its great potential when it comes to operating safely and efficiently and service to our customers. Over the next slide, and on this slide is pretty self-explanatory to me. It shows we've stabilized our network and we've performed pretty well over the quarter. While one of our key focus areas is on maintaining and bettering our customer facing metrics.  Our fluidity has started to allow us to look deeper at our operating plan, again to better align the hard assets needed to move the volume. The team's been focused on maximizing car connections and maximizing the train load, while at the same time reducing locomotive dwell and active horsepower on trains. As a result, we've seen both the reduction in active locomotive use and daily train start.  Tighten connections standards in our yards are starting to drive changes to our operating plan that result in quicker connections. Driving a strong focus on using our locomotive technology to reduce fuel usage on line of road has contributed to a savings overall fuel cost. Altogether, we're finding tangible opportunities to open up more capacity on this network. I expect these metrics to continue to improve as we go forward.  Moving over to Slide 10. And I really believe we've made good headway in Q4 and especially over 2023. Our key metrics continue to improve in our network fluid. Our headcount is at the point that we're now able to manage through efficiency and attrition. We're paying close attention to resource requirements for any new business coming online when needed. Our focus on car connections and train tonnage closely matched horsepower along with network fluidity allowed us to reduce 2.5% of our daily starts in the quarter and start to store active locomotives.  Among other things, this coming quarter, we'll be performing full territory reviews with our team that will further improve our customer service and continue to identify opportunities to better align asset use. And of course, we'll be working right along with Kevin and his sales and marketing team to deliver this great service and grow with our customers.  During closing, during my four months on the property, I continue to learn more about this network and especially the women and men that make up this tremendous ONE CSX team. I'm extremely excited about our potential to deliver our customers better service with greater safety, efficiency and teamwork.  I'm excited to do this together as one group of great railroaders. So thanks for the time. Over to you, Kevin. Sorry. I was just going to finish up. Look, overall asset use, whether it's locomotives, trains we run, how productive all of us are, they're front and center for what we look at. And so for me, it's really, I'd say out of a scale out 1 to 10, I'm about a 4 in terms of where I am in understanding our network and understanding our people. However, we're really starting to focus in on the things that aren't working right. They aren't working against what we think we can do with the franchise, with the network we have. So whether it's size of trains, the state of the train, the use of the technology we have to get the most out of the locomotive. It's just, right now, it's blocking and tackling, and it's everybody coming together. So we're learning, we're teaching we're sharing best practices. We're doing the things that, in that fourth quarter was really the last couple of months that we really started to see the things we could do because, first of all, we had the head count. We had the reliability and the fluidity of the network.  And so we're just going to keep grinding that stone. But as I said in my remarks, we're going to really get deep into the operating plans over every corridor over the next few quarters. And I'll leave that charge, but I tell you what, I've got a lot of people that are that are out there ready to go and they're very qualified to do this. So I see, to Sean's point, we got further efficiency ahead of us, but never at the expense of safety and never at the expense of customer service. So our hope is that we continue to provide this great product and the customers are going to come. And that's how we'll also get the efficiency that we need. Hey, Brandon, I hope you're well. Look, I'm not going to say at this stage that we can add incremental volume without headcount. It depends on what it is and where it's at. But I'm very comfortable with the results we had in a run rate of more train size. And that obviously reduces the impact on the headcount. We've got areas that we just haven't got to in my time yet. And I think the -- and this isn't just about trade and size, but we really, we have a very customer-intensive network. And so we have a lot of yards and locals and first of all, we're looking to button down and make the service reliable.  And with the head count we have right now, we see that we're able to do it. So that leads us to know that we can do better. And so I see the opportunities really in the touches of the cars that we do today. So I see further incremental improvement. I see the ability with the capacity we're creating with the locomotives that we've got added to the storage count to the capacity we created online by having less movements. I see us being able to handle incremental volume with what we have in many cases. But again, there are those key areas we want to make sure that we have the right head count for. Yeah, thanks, Ken. It just goes back to what I'm talking about in our yards and our terminal performance, and that's where our focus will be. Again, I've been getting the folks to really focus on connecting cars, increasing train size. So we're going through some growth periods in that sense. Yeah, it's affecting the on-time performance. But at the end of the day, we're counting on making sure we fulfill the trip plan of the customer, and in some cases, it's going to change the way we design our network and the time the trains go.  So I'm not concerned about that at this stage. It certainly isn't anything to do with congestion or poor performance. These are the growing, the growth what I call, growth observations of a network that's starting to change and really look to more maximize the assets that we have out there to create capacity. So it's not a cause of concern at this moment. Trust me, we look at it in a lot, measured at the minute. So this isn't, it's not like we've got trains that are late, late, late. These are fractions of hours. And so that's fine. We know we have to operate on time. But at the end of the day, it's the delivery to the customer. It's their first mile, last miles, their pain points that we're focused on. And at the same time, we're driving efficiency through running a more condensed network. Yeah. And just on top of that, too, Chris. Staying with locomotives, where we still have opportunity to use the locomotives we have out there working, use them harder. And so that's a big focus for us, whether it's dwell, whether it's connection, whether it's what they're pulling, I believe we have the capacity to grow just of what we have out there right now."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Third Quarter 2023 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Mr. Matt Korn, Head of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.\nMatt Korn: Thank you, Krista. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2, followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3. And with that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. Over this last year, CSX mission and message have remained clear and consistent. We have seen great progress with our ONE CSX initiatives, which are helping to build a focused, collaborative culture that enables all of our employees to feel engaged, energized and focused on working better together. At the same time, our service levels continue to lead the industry. These successes go hand in hand. And as our customers see that CSX is truly dedicated to providing consistent, reliable service over the long term, they're responding positively. As we look forward to all the opportunities ahead, we are confident that these efforts we are making will drive clear, sustainable, profitable growth. And we took another step forward on this path this quarter. Thanks to the hard work put in by our ONE CSX team, our railroad is running well. Our merchandise business remained steady, and our coal shipments were very strong. Our domestic intermodal volumes are growing well compared to last year. Our international intermodal business, though down year-over-year, has stabilized. Overall, our network continues to perform, and I am pleased with how the team has succeeded in managing the things that we can control. I continue to be very excited about all the potential ahead for CSX. Now, let's turn to Slide 5 to review the highlights for the third quarter. First, we moved over 1.5 million carloads this quarter, which was down just slightly from a year ago, with flat year-over-year performance in merchandise and 9% growth in coal. Our operating ratio ticked up into the low 60% as we faced challenges that we have been talking about all year, with lower fuel recovery, reduced intermodal storage revenue, lower export coal prices, and higher costs of inflation, most notably with our labor contract. As in previous quarters, our margin does include the impact of the Quality Carriers trucking business. Second, we generated $3.6 billion in revenue, which was 8% lower than the previous year. The last year we benefited from high diesel prices and record export coal benchmarks that were both much lower this quarter. Third, even with the year-over-year changes we faced, charges -- changes we faced, operating income still came in at $1.3 billion for the quarter compared to a little under $1.6 billion last year. And our earnings per share were $0.42, down from $0.52. I am proud of what we accomplished this quarter given all the challenges. None of us here are satisfied with these results. We're not sitting back and simply waiting for markets to turn. We're looking throughout the entire network to see where we can operate more efficiently. We continue to work closely with our customers to build our business pipeline and drive more volume onto the railroad. And we're emphasizing the importance of cost discipline to every team in every one of our locations. One of the reasons I am so confident about what is ahead for CSX is the great leadership team that we have in place. As you all saw last month, we are very pleased to announce that Mike Cory has joined our railroad as Chief Operating Officer. Mike brings great experience and a thorough understanding of schedule railroading, and he also shares our deep dedication and appreciation for customer service and the employees who provide that service day in and day out. Mike arrived in Jacksonville a few weeks ago and is now here joining us on this call. And so, I will now turn it over to Mike to say a few words and cover our operational performance over the quarter.\nMike Cory: Well, thank you very much, Joe. And I truly appreciate the words. And I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity to work with such a committed team of people with so much potential to lead this industry with great customer service. Safety, service, efficiency, and along with engagement with each other, customers and stakeholders, is how we're going to leverage this great franchise to be best in class. And I've been here a short time, pretty much less than a month, but I've been really busy. I've visited major yards, coal export facilities, and I've spent time in headquarters meeting with an array of people from different functions of the railroad. Well, in person, I've listened to and I've spoken with employees from all across the company; from people on the ground executing the plan, from people developing the plan, to sales and marketing, finance, field and network ops, IT facilities, and the list goes on. But what really resonates with me is their collective desire to be the best they can be for our ONE CSX team and our customers. And we've got great talent in all our functions, and our job is to connect the talent and maximize the value of their efforts. We're doing this in order for our team to be the best at providing what our customers need in the safest and most efficient way. We're doing this because decision-making, acting on what they see and know, must be quick and done as close to where the opportunity is taking place. That said, I see opportunities, one of which, and to me, the most important at this stage, is to create and share a robust and visible flow of information that will derive improvement through the continuation of the lean principles that define schedule railroad. We all need to see the effects of our collective decisions as fast as possible, be more nimble and responsive to our customers' needs. As well, collectively we'll learn and share best practices throughout the organization from this and other available data as it gives us a platform to learn as it happens. This will create the speed and the trust that we need to move together as one team. So, let's go over to the slides and we'll start looking at our safety metrics. Our third quarter injury and accident rates increased as we saw track-caused and human factor incidents trend upward. These aren't acceptable outcomes for us. And we're taking action to continuously improve the environment our employees operate in, as well as the overall safety culture. Human factor incidents, especially with newly hired employees, is one of the trends this year that have driven the increase. In Q3, the team added additional time for initial training for our new conductors at our REDI Center in Atlanta. We also looked at the length of training when new hires graduate from Atlanta and report back to their home terminals and increase the length of that training as well. Increased training gives us more time to develop skills with our new hires, but we also determined we needed to place resources to spend that time with them. So, we train unionized mentors and now we have them across the property with the new hires. These mentors are available to teach and answer questions, reinforcing the ONE CSX culture by being part of developing and coaching their newly hired peers. Lastly, on safety, we're not taking our focus off life-changing events. We've partnered with DEKRA, a speciality risk management group, to rollout training to help employees self-identify risk in an ever-changing environment. Now traditionally, railroads train on operating rules, but we can't write a rule for everything or test our way to a positive safety culture. Both identification of risk and eliminating that risk when possible is one of our major goals moving into Q4 and beyond. So, let's go over to the next slide on our operating highlights. Our end-to-end train velocity averaged 17.6 miles an hour in the third quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but still up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.6 hours, an improvement of nearly 20% compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance was 94% and increased by 4 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance was 82% and improved by 25 percentage points. Our service performance remains fluid. And though we did see a slight seasonal dip during the middle of the quarter during peak vacation and holiday season, our metrics are rebounding into the fourth quarter. We all know and we will -- we all know we will and we're all working together to improve these results. Our ability to leverage this great franchise by connecting the people and the vast talent they bring will allow us to improve all key aspects of our business, with a strong focus on those lean management principles that drive reliable, consistent service. I'm really confident that connecting all of these dots together is going to result in a strong team now, and, more importantly, bench strength for the future. This is really our ONE CSX goal. And so, with that, over to you, Kevin.\nKevin Boone: Thank you. Mike and I have been spending a lot of time together and it is really great to have you on the team. To start, I'm pleased to say that our improving service levels are a key differentiator in the marketplace. I can't thank the entire team enough for all the hard work. These improvements are being recognized by our customers and are leading to new initiatives and discussions around how CSX can partner with our customers for growth. Our ability to grow profitably requires us to be proactive, quickly adapt to changing markets, and think differently. I'm proud of how well we have been able to coordinate with operations to drive both growth and efficiencies. With Mike in his role, we have only seen these efforts accelerate. It's no surprise that overall economic conditions remain uncertain, but it has been encouraging to see gradually improving sequential trends across several of our end markets over this past quarter. We see many, many reasons to be optimistic as we continue to build our business pipeline with an eye toward 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 10 to look at our merchandise performance for the quarter. Our revenues were down modestly compared to last year on flat volumes, as solid core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge and negative mix effects in certain markets. Our automotive business continued to show strength with higher production and business wins driving a 19% increase in volume year-over-year. Minerals continues to perform very well, sustained by infrastructure activity that is supporting new cement facilities and healthy demand for aggregates. Metals performance has also benefited from our service levels, leading to competitive wins and solid demand. Our chemical franchise, while challenged, has begun to stabilize and even showed some promising improvement in domestic plastics over the quarter. Fertilizer revenue growth was strong in the quarter, despite volumes that were impacted by weaker short-haul movements with production challenges in Florida. As we expected, the strong Southeastern corn crop meant less rail volume for grain, and forest products remains one of the most challenged areas with many mills still taking meaningful downtime. As we start the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the early October volume trends with most markets showing sequential momentum. We anticipate a strong rebound for ag and food as a strong Midwest harvest kicks in. And across other markets, we expect our service improvements to drive opportunities to win in the marketplace as we focus on modal conversion. Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter coal revenue declined 5%, even though volumes were very strong, growing 9% compared to last year. Export demand continued to be a major volume driver, growing 26%, with the hot summer also supporting solid domestic demand. Strong coal volumes minimize the effects of lower international benchmark prices, which were setting all-time records this time last year. The key difference was met coal pricing where global benchmarks were much lower than in the same period last year. Sequentially, our coal RPU declined 11% compared to our guidance of mid-teens decline, with stronger-than-expected shipments to longer length of haul Southern utility customers driving the moderate outperformance. Looking ahead to the last quarter of the year, we expect export markets to remain strong and are pleased with the increases in international benchmarks that we've seen over the last several weeks. On the domestic side, we have seen stockpiles normalize and demand in the 2024 will be driven by winter weather and related demand needs. The increase in global benchmark prices should benefit our cold yields next quarter. So, I would remind you that we have a diverse portfolio of met customers and we have seen U.S.-based met coal benchmarks and those in other regions lag spot prices in Australia. Turning to intermodal on Slide 12. As a whole, the business remained challenged with revenue declining by 14% and total volume decreasing by 7%. Overall, RPU declined by 8% year-over-year with the impact of lower fuel surcharge accounting for the decline, partially offset by positive price. That said, we are seeing encouraging trends from our domestic business. Our volume turned positive on a year-over-year basis early in the summer, and that's continued to improve since then. We offer a diverse mix of transportation solutions within domestic intermodal, and we've seen great results from our strong channel partnerships and our direct relationships with major retailers. Our team has been successful in converting traffic off the highway in a market facing plentiful truck capacity, which is a testament to the team in the market-leading service product. Meanwhile, international intermodal activity has stabilized but remains weak. We haven't seen any clear signs of a positive inflection yet. Retailers remain concerned about the health of the consumer. And though de-stocking may have slowed, we haven't seen this turn into sustained increases in order rates or imports. For the rest of the year, we expect trends to largely continue as they were over the third quarter, with domestic gradually strengthening, supported by our team strong sales efforts. While we prepare for the turning point for international, recall that we saw meaningful drop offs in our intermodal volume in the back half of the fourth quarter in 2022, as markets slowed substantially, which will benefit our reported growth rate for the current quarter. Slide 13 provides a clear illustration of the encouraging signs we're seeing within our intermodal business. On a year-over-year basis, domestic intermodal has shown a favorable trend since the beginning of 2023, turning positive around mid-year and steadily improving since. While international volumes remain lower compared to 2022, we've seen stability in the past few months. Altogether, across all of our businesses, our team continues to push forward across multiple initiatives, aimed at winning wallet share, converting truck traffic and bringing new customers to the railroad. We remain confident that our leading service performance will continue to provide opportunities to win business. And we know that we have the resources and capacity in place to deliver growth when the market environment inflects. I'm proud of what the collective CSX team has accomplished this quarter. I'm excited about all the potential ahead. Now, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss financials.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. The third quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was lower by 18% or $284 million. These results include nearly $350 million of year-over-year impacts from lower intermodal storage revenue, export coal benchmark prices, and fuel recovery, partly offset by $42 million of favorability related to last year's labor agreement adjustment. Suffice it to say this quarter should represent the peak year-over-year impact from these discrete items. Revenue fell by 8% or $323 million despite strong pricing across many merchandise portfolio along with positive volume trends across many merchandise markets, as well as domestic intermodal. The operating team also worked tirelessly to meet customer needs and deliver a 9% increase in coal volume. Across merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery increased 2% in the quarter and was up mid-single digits, excluding the impacts of coal RPU headwinds. Expenses were lower by 2%, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $13 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $32 million as the impact of lower pre-tax earnings more than offset a prior year favorable state tax item. And this quarter's effective tax rate came in at 24.9%. As a result, earnings per share fell by $0.10, including nearly $0.12 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total third quarter expense decreased by $39 million. Lower fuel prices and cycling the prior year labor true-up were mostly offset by the impacts of inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense decreased $7 million as the prior year union labor adjustment was largely offset by inflation and increased headcount. Heightened attention to overtime benefited cost per employee, particularly in our mechanical workforce where overtime ratios are now running at multi-year lows. Purchased services and other expense increased $25 million versus last year, including $16 million associated with higher casualty expense. Turning to sequential performance versus Q2 on the right-hand side of the page, network performance and numerous cost control initiatives in the quarter drove a nearly $20 million reduction in PS&O across our operating departments. We expect these savings to remain in the fourth quarter aside from normal seasonality. Depreciation was up $21 million as a result of last year's equipment study, as well as a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $89 million, mostly driven by a lower gallon price. This was partially offset by higher consumption, including approximately 2.5 million gallons recognized from prior periods. Adjusting for this, fuel efficiency was still unfavorable versus the prior year. And Mike has brought an increased focus on this critical measure. While seasonality will impact fuel efficiency in Q4, we fully expect to get back on trend. Equipment and rents was $10 million favorable, driven by faster freight car cycle times across all markets. These benefits were partly offset by costs related to higher automotive volumes. Finally, property gains were $21 million unfavorable in the quarter. As a reminder, we are cycling over $50 million of prior year gains in Q4 and expect sales this year to be minimal. Now turning to cashflow and distributions on Slide 17. Reflecting the discrete factors I discussed earlier, free cashflow is down from the prior year, but remains strong, supporting investments in the safety and reliability of our network, as well as an increased level of high return strategic investments. Robust cashflow has also supported over $3.5 billion in shareholder returns so far this year, including $2.9 billion in share repurchases and over $650 million of dividends. Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings, is about $160 million lower year-to-date, impacted again by intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing. Nevertheless, the focus on economic profit is helping to incent a pipeline of high return initiatives that will deliver growth and ongoing efficiency gains. Now with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Sean. Now as shown on Slide 19, we will finish with some updated comments on our outlook as we approach the final quarter of 2023. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in revenue ton-miles for the full year, supported by our consistent performance in merchandise and export coal. Automotive and minerals remain important growth areas. So, obviously, we're watching developments with the [Detroit Three] (ph) automakers and the UAW very closely. As Kevin mentioned, we also look for a substantial rebound in our ag and food business over the fourth quarter. Export coal volumes remain strong as global demand stays high for U.S. met and thermal coal. For domestic coal, we anticipate some slowdown from the third quarter, which benefited from hot summer weather, though so far this quarter we continue to be pleased with our shipment levels. For intermodal, as we mentioned, we expect domestic activity to keep gaining modest momentum through the fourth quarter. While for now, our international business looks largely stable. Overall, our volume growth rate in intermodal will reflect favorable year-over-year comparisons. As we've said all year, the pricing environment remains supportive, and we have been encouraged by the agreements that you've already reached for 2024. Note that with the slowdown in intermodal storage revenue that we have seen over the course of this year, we are now expecting supplemental revenue, excluding trucking, to decline by $325 million for the full year. Our commitment to efficiency and cost control remains in place as we keep our eye on service performance, not just in the near term, but also as we look ahead to improve market conditions and greater demand for rail capacity. Finally, our estimate of $2.3 billion in capital expenditures remains unchanged, along with our strong focus on innovation and growth. I will close by saying that I'm very proud of what we've accomplished as ONE CSX team as I finished my first year with CSX. When I spoke to all of you last fall, we talked about our belief that CSX could accomplish great things and create so much value by working better together as one team to serve our customers. We have made very good progress. And all of us know that there remains so much more we can do. I'm even more enthusiastic about our opportunities than I was last year. We all appreciate your support and interest in our company and we keep -- as we keep moving forward. All right, thank you. And Matthew, we're now ready for questions.\nMatt Korn: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. Now, in the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one question. Krista, we're ready to start the process.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Maybe Joe or Mike, kind of wanted to start with your sense of where you are in terms of resources and services relative to the volume environment. So, headcount moved up again. Maybe give us -- if you can give us a sense of where you think you need to take that or if you're at reasonable staffing levels? And maybe how we think about, like I said, that resource base relative to the volume environment? Do you have the ability to do more at these current levels, or are we still in a little bit of the recovery phase?\nMike Cory: Hey, Chris, it's Mike. Look, and again, I'm going to preface every -- probably most of my answers with, I've been here less than a month, but we still have the training pipeline. We still have people that we need to get into position that I spoke of earlier. But overall, I'm comfortable that we have enough to improve the size of train, the amount of trains, the velocity with the people we have. But however, there are areas where we're probably getting affected somewhat on the flow of the goods. And so, it's constant. We're working -- not just Kevin and I, but our teams together. So they really get the ground floor view of what we can do. And not having been here for that long, I haven't really stretched the opportunities out there yet. So, I'd say, to answer your question, we're where we need to be. We have people that are being trained that are going to be positioned. And remember, we have attrition, whether its retirement or whatever the case. So, we're filling that. And with the people we have. We're in good shape. We have to get in better shape, and a lot of that's going to come from self-help and how we utilize the assets.\nJoe Hinrichs: Yeah. Chris, just the last thing I'll add is, as Mike mentioned, we're still hiring in a few key locations. That's down to a little more than a handful. And largely, we're in pretty good shape in most other spots. And with the natural attrition we have, we're still hiring to replace some of that because we are still -- our merchandise volume is up this year. So, we're still seeing some growth in volume. But we feel pretty good about our ability to manage that. And Mike has really challenged the team to come with a new set of -- fresh new set of eyes to look at how we can do some self-help to free up some of our crews to help us even be more efficient. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, thanks for taking the question. And Mike, welcome back to the industry. Congrats. Just wanted to ask more about the -- excuse me, on the service side, maybe for Kevin. You're seeing some conversion that you mentioned of areas that have excess truck capacity. So, is the stuff that you thought you lost before and was going to come back, or has the service been so good for so long that people actually going to convert and stay there? Just trying to get a sense of the stickiness of that. And then, Sean, if you can just give us some comments on the cost per employee for the fourth quarter? It looks like overtime is coming down quite a bit. There's always mix and trainees involved. So, any color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Yeah. I would say on the truck conversion side, we're really, really early into this thing. The good news is customers are willing to start to have those conversations that quite frankly we just couldn't have a year ago, given where we were. And so, we're building momentum. I expect this to build on itself into next year. The great thing is, I think as an industry, we're starting to become aligned in terms of going after growth, going after some of the opportunities that exist out there collectively as an industry, and I think that's very encouraging as well. But it's a mixture. It's a mixture of going after new customers. Clearly, you pointed out, the trucking market is not very supportive right now. But even in this market, we're finding customers that, with ESG and with other things, are wanting to have that discussion. There's still value that we can drive. But I only expect as that trucking market firms up in the next year and the years ahead that this will accelerate on itself and see a lot of momentum coming.\nSean Pelkey: Brian, on your follow-up question around cost per employee, we did -- made a lot of progress on the overtime front in the third quarter. That's an area that Mike has been focused on right from the very beginning, trying to figure out ways we can restructure the work and eliminate waste in certain locations. So that's going to help. I will say though sequentially Q3 to Q4, you probably will see still an uptick in cost per employee like we normally do. That's driven by some capital work labor that will go over to OE in the fourth quarter. We also have some seasonal vacation and some accruals that will hit in the fourth quarter. So I would say, sequentially Q3 to Q4, you'll probably see comp per employee up a few percent.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good evening, and thanks for taking my question. And Mike, welcome back as well. And I guess, Mike, can I just ask you, the U.S. roads historically just haven't had a great track record of organic growth and we know it seems like coal have been a long-term headwind. But what have you seen in your first month or so that you like to see at the CSX plan or changes you want to make that will help with this idea that CSX can outgrow the market looking ahead?\nMike Cory: Hey, Brandon. Thank you. Wow. I mentioned in my remarks, the visibility of information and it just -- it creates this connection where people see -- we have people that manage terminals, that manage the dispatch on the road, we have people that manage people from a crew management perspective, we manage -- look, we do all these things individually and to see that altogether and then again back to being understanding of what it is you can do, whether it's from a capacity or service perspective, but then cutting in with Kevin's team, we can get sticky because we can really understand all the work we're doing is really to get that business is to keep that business. And I see that here -- the opportunity here is -- look, the railway I came from, you got the business, you went 1,200, 1,500 miles and then there was more business here, it's everywhere. And it's not -- it's competitive, but there's lots of that. And Kevin -- we're not talking so much about the truck. Obviously, we're going to grow with the market and what it gives us, but I just -- I think the opportunity here when we connect our people, we are everywhere. We service, what is it, two-thirds of the U.S. market. And that's just opportunity in itself is. So, I don't know if I'm answering your question. Again, I've been here a month. But I see that, that's really what our goal is. We want to grow properly. We wanted to be ratable. We want to make sure that we're in position for it. And we're going to make sure that we rid ourselves of waste. So, we're not getting rid of the assets that we need when it does come.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Mike, I kind of want to build on that and you kind of brought up your former role as well. You transitioned there from a PSR railroad to a growth railroad, and maybe that didn't go as smoothly as you would have hoped. So, you're not joining a fixer-upper here. CSX's service metrics have improved vastly over the last year or two, and now you're pivoting the growth. So, what are some of the lessons that you've learned from that transition at the last role on some of the dangers to avoid? And how you manage capacity as you're trying to fill the network without clogging up the network and causing service issues?\nMike Cory: Thanks, Jonathan. One of the wounds just opened up. Look, it's no different. We have to be really aligned. First of all, we have to understand what our assets and our people can do for us and expand on that, obviously. But I just don't see the market, the commodities we move being the same as the growth is where I came from. And so, again, I have a long way to go to understand the market and I'm working extremely hard with Kevin to understand it. But look, the principles are the same. We sell a service, we deliver a service. And how fast we recover from any service disruptions is key to keeping the customer knowing that our goal is to be the reliable provider for them. So, I don't see any difference. And you can go back and take a look at the hockey stick recovery and all that great history, but I'm looking forward. And I don't think anything changes in my view as to how we approach this. We know what we can do, and we continue to really stay close. And again, the teams being together from the ground floor up, there shouldn't be surprises. And if there are, we're going to build our resiliency so that we can attack it again and again be reliable for the customer. So, I don't see that big of a difference in terms of the model that we have here or where we have -- wherever we have, what we had -- what I had before. It's sell the service, deliver the service. And Kevin is really working hard with his team on ratability. So, there shouldn't be surprises.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe Kevin, any -- just any color on how much of a uptick in the coal yield we should expect in Q4 and into Q1? And then maybe just Sean, just help us think about some of the puts and takes for Q4. It just sounds like better volume, less of a fuel headwind, maybe some met uplift, but maybe some continued cost pressure. So, you put it altogether, that's -- you think operating ratio gets better or worse from Q3? Any directional color you want to give us?\nKevin Boone: Yeah. Scott, there can be a lot of mix issues within our coal business. When you think about Southern utilities, longer length of haul, higher RPU versus Northern utilities. Export coal, very, very good business, can be shorter haul, so can sometimes be a little bit lower RPU as well. But [indiscernible] given some of the benchmark strength that we've seen, I would look for something in the low-single digits, maybe mid-single digits depending on mix.\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. And Scott, on your question around Q4, I think you did a good job of kind of summarizing the factors. We're off to a good start in terms of the volume, and that's obviously one of the most important factors in terms of not only seeing OR stay stable to improve, but also more importantly growing our earnings. As you mentioned, fuel should be a little bit less of a negative here in Q4 than it was in Q3. We'll see what the direction of fuel prices is, but we have $30 million lag in the third quarter that we don't expect to repeat. And then in terms of the cost, seasonally, we typically do see higher costs in Q4 than Q3. So, if you were to look over the last five years, each and every one of those years, the OR has been worse in Q4 than Q3, and everything except for 2020, the COVID year, operating income has been down sequentially from the third quarter. Now, we're off to a good start like I said, and we've got our eyes fixed on places that we can eliminate waste and control costs. So I think we've got a good shot of bucking that seasonal trend and doing a little bit better than that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long from Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks, and good afternoon. Kevin, it sounds like you've recently had some early success with market share gains both truck and rail. But could you expand a little bit more on the commodity groups where you're seeing the most meaningful tailwinds on that front? And as we move into 2024, where you see the most opportunity to keep that momentum going?\nKevin Boone: Yeah. I think it's really within our merchandise portfolio and it's broad-based. There's different initiatives across the board from our metals side of the business which I highlighted. Automotive has been a good strength for us. And it's all on the back of service that's differentiated in the market, and we've really been able to capitalize on that with the customer. The customers are looking for reliable service, and I think we've been a standout in the market here year-to-date, and our team has been selling it, and it's been incredibly helpful on that side. I will say we're going to start to see some benefits of the industrial development side, more in probably the '25, '26, but you'll start to see that layer in, in late '24 and got a lot of momentum there. And again, it goes back to the service product that we've been able to deliver and getting the confidence as these industries build new plants that are locating on our railroad. So, I actually just sat down with Christina this afternoon, and we were going through all the industrial projects that have been taking place throughout the U.S. And it's interesting, you look at a map holistically throughout the U.S. and it's almost focused on the East and that's all railroad. That's where we operate and that's where our team is really going after it today. And I'm very, very optimistic on what's happening in that side. So, a lot of opportunities. They are mixed across different industries, and every industry is created a little bit different, but we are being able to lean into those conversations, quite different environment than what was occurring last year, but very, very optimistic here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Thanks a lot. Hi, everyone. Sean, I wanted to just follow up on that question around 3Q to 4Q, but maybe ask it as it relates to 2024. I mean, obviously we're moving from a very inflationary environment to a less inflationary environment. You've got a little bit of labor -- another uptick in labor in the middle of next year. But then I also look at like PS&O, is that -- 19% of revenue, several years ago was as low as 14%, 15% of revenue. But there's obviously some opportunity to get more leverage on the cost structure, especially on that big PS&O item. So, I don't know if you can kind of help us enter your brain a little bit and think what is the cost structure look like in '24? Because, obviously, we're still in an inflationary environment, but you still got maybe these chunky, idiosyncratic opportunities to kind of leverage some parts of the cost structure.\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. Amit, obviously, we're still in the planning phases for 2024. So, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here. But you know the story on labor and just to make sure everybody understands and to level set, we're going to have a 4.5% wage increase mid-year next year, that's the last year of the contract with the union employees. That's a step up from the 4% increase that we had mid-year this year. In terms of PS&O, at least on the inflationary side, it's early, but I think it's fair to say that we'll start to see some normalization of the inflationary pressures from this year. So, we had mid-single digit inflation this year. It'll probably be a little bit less than that, but certainly higher than the five-year average as some of those outside service contracts are based on lagging indicators or labor indices that are going to reset. So, suffice it to say, I do think we've got fewer headwinds overall going into next year than we did going into this year. And that sets us up well. We've got cost and efficiency opportunities, but I think more importantly, Kevin and the team are building a really nice pipeline of growth that really stems from the way that we've been serving the customer over the last year. And that sustained service level as well as some of the initiatives the team has been working on, that's really what's going to drive growth as we get into next year and beyond.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz from UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good afternoon. Wanted to see, I guess, it's kind of staying in the same topic, Sean, but if you think about 2024 and volume sensitivity in terms of how the OR performs, do you think that there's a chance that you could see improvement in the OR if you don't see volume growth? And perhaps related to that, from a pricing perspective, I think sometimes people think that there is a time delay on some of the pricing with multi-year contracts and there might be catch-up on pricing related to inflation. So, I guess, it's kind of two things within that, just OR sensitivity to volume and also potential catch-up on pricing. Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Yeah, Tom. So, I mean, our plan is going to be to grow volume ahead of the economy, that's what we're going to shoot for, that's what we're going to plan for. So I think if we were to have no growth next year, I think it would be tough to improve the OR with the continued inflationary pressures that we're seeing. You're cycling. We had that insurance settlement earlier in the year. So, there's a few things there. Depreciation will continue to go up, things like that. So, we need growth. That's what the model requires and that's what we're building into the plan. Kevin, I don't know if you want to address the price piece.\nKevin Boone: Yeah. On the pricing, roughly 60% of our business reprices every year and 30% of that is kind of carryover of what we've already touched this year. So, we'll touch the other half going into next year and the environment is still supportive and it certainly helps when the service product is vastly improved. And we'll continue to price to our service levels, and those are up. And so, it's a conversation that customers expect. Our labor inflation is very visible to the world. We have those discussions. They're not unexpected from the customer.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just want to go back to the domestic intermodal side. You're starting to see some conversion from truck here. When you're talking to customers, what's really starting -- holding them back from converting at this point? Is there something in the service product that you have to evolve, or is it just simply building that trust with the reliability that you guys have had over the past few months? Just any thoughts there?\nJoe Hinrichs: Yeah, to reflect on the pandemic and that's -- the domestic intermodal and our intermodal franchise performed very, very well. It really was outshined the industry in a lot of ways. What minimized our growth opportunity was really the chassis and some of the equipment limitations that existed. So, obviously, we're in a very, very different world today. And so those limitations don't exist on a year-over-year basis. And we're really seeing the team able to capitalize on that. And the strength of our service product is really coming through. When you see what we talked about in the chart that we mentioned previously is, I think all those things are coming together. Service leading in the East, and then allowing our customers to grow with us with our service product.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good afternoon. Mike, welcome back to the sector and happy to have you here. Joe or Mike, I guess, just operations seem pretty solid, right, in terms of how well you're operating and obviously you still want to improve. And maybe Mike, just talk about what -- I know you've been there for a month, but what do you see as, I don't know, if it's low-hanging fruit or opportunities on operations? It sounds like Sean saying or Kevin saying, you need the volumes in order to get that operating leverage, but are there things you can do on the cost side from what you see that can aid that leverage opportunity?\nMike Cory: Yeah, I can, thanks. Look, visibility of waste and getting it and collating that information so that I can -- what I do is I try to teach and learn, learn and teach. That's really what it's about. So, we have a good group of people, many of them younger, haven't been experienced in the positions they're in. So that's really where I've been focusing, first of all, to get a temperature read, but really start to share with them how to go about getting at that waste. And it's not easy in a network like this. And it's something that we will do as a team, but I'm not big on the next day looking at a report. I want it visible right away so they see their actions. And so, I see great opportunity in that. They're hungry to do it. They're more than motivated. And it's up to me to teach them and help them get there. And I have all the confidence in the world that's where we'll get. But we'll see just through the waste exercise at first, and then it starts to allow you to get into understanding how to devise the network to Kevin's point, to keep and even get better service and get the businesses out there.\nJoe Hinrichs: Yeah, Ken, I just want to add a little thing. I think the timing of Mike joining us is perfect, because we've had a year of taking advantage of the operating model that we have, engaging with our employees, do a lot of things around culture and our ONE CSX. We've made tremendous progress, especially on the service metrics, as you've seen, and we have close industry-leading metrics across the board on the operating side. Now we have Mike coming in with his experience, fresh set of eyes, and all the opportunities that can now allow us to now step back and say, \"Okay, we've come this far, great work. Proud of the team's work. Now, here's the opportunity that we have to advance even further.\" And so, the timing is perfect, I think, for us. Works out very nicely. Our team is excited and motivated. You've seen now, as Kevin has highlighted many times in his comments tonight, regarding the customers have acknowledged and they acknowledge that with me all the time, the service levels that we've sustained, almost reliably now and repeatedly for 12 months. And now we have the opportunity to get more efficient and to get even better. And Mike has come in with a great attitude and excited about how we can take it to the next level and still focus, of course, on improving our service metrics, but also teaching our team, which is a relatively young team, to understand what it takes now to take a next step forward. So, we're excited about it. I'm excited about it, and I think we can continue to outpace the industry when it comes to progress on our efficiency metrics.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Thank you. To follow up on that earlier question, can you roll that out a little bit further, not just on the service side, but Mike, your role from -- in the mandate you've been given to focus on culture, sales, the integration of Kevin's department with yours, what we, like, see different from CSX over the next three to five years versus what we've seen over the last three to five? Thank you.\nMike Cory: That's a tough one, Bascome. I'm still out there trying to learn. And that's important to me because I don't want to block anybody or make them feel they can't come forward with an idea. That's number one. But going forward, I want to share the experience I have so that they're incorporating that into the things they do today. And to me, we'll see improvements in all our metrics. A bigger focus on -- when I say velocity, I'm talking both trains and cars, but fluidity. And we run a pretty condensed network here. Everything is really close. We don't have, in many cases, a lot of time to recover. So, it's the plan we put into effect and the discipline about executing it. And so, what I'm trying to share with them is the availability of data and how to use it. It hasn't -- I don't see that they've had enough time. They've gone through a pretty tough period here over the last couple of years. They've rebounded extremely nicely. And to Joe's point, this is to get to the next level, so where they're self-sufficient. And I know they can be, they know they can be, but I'm here to show them that way. And maybe Kevin, if you have something to add.\nKevin Boone: Yeah, I would just -- I would highlight that the teams, Mike's team and my team, they coordinate daily. They're speaking better than they ever have to each other. It's important from a sales and marketing perspective. You talked about can we handle an upsurge in volume demand. Well, it's up to us to communicate that real time so the team can work, make sure we're prepared for that volume, communicate with a customer, and make sure it's rateable and that we have the people in place to handle it. I think a lot of the discussions we're having right now are around that. I don't think it's rocket science to figure out where things could come back very, very quickly. We're having those discussions around creating resiliency in this network. And we're going to get together in a couple of weeks, our teams again, go through it market by market. What do we see for next year? What do we see over the next three years? And how are we going to prepare for that? And those conversations are better than they ever have been.\nMike Cory: Yeah, and I'll just finish up. Bascome, like -- I've been, like I said, pretty much to -- well, not pretty much everywhere, but a lot of locations. And I really focus on bringing everybody that has a role in servicing the customer. I was up in Baltimore, Curtis Bay, everybody from facilities to Kevin and his marketing team, to the people that run the plant, to our engineering, mechanical, everybody has a role to play. And when they see their actions actually doing it together, they become more than customer advocates. They know and can respond to the customer much faster because they know exactly what they can offer. And so, going forward, this is not operations and marketing. No, this is CSX. This is how we approach this. This is how we build the business and keep it and drive it even better for the customer. That's what I see in three to five years.\nJoe Hinrichs: You guys can't see it, but Mike has the shirt on, it's ONE CSX. That's what we're talking about here. And that's the vision that our teams are seamless enough that people see CSX as one entity, not a bunch of different functions and silos, all focused on, of course, safety first of our employees and the communities we live in and serve, but ultimately the service we provide our customers, which leads to the growth potential that we've all talked about. And it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out in this business what incremental margins come with growth in this business. But from my year-plus experience here now, we will realize the most potential when we have operations and marketing sales as described by both Kevin and Mike as one team, looking at every opportunity together with a can do, let's find a way to make sure it's profitable, let's find a way to be able to serve the customer and do it efficiently. And that's the spirit of ONE CSX, focus on how on teaching and training our employees to be part of that team and to get excited by that opportunity and do it in a way that we're proud of how we work together in service of the customer. That's ONE CSX is what everyone's talking about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Joe and team, good afternoon. Mike, welcome back. It must be pretty exciting coming, hitting the ground running and railroad showing improving service numbers. So, we look forward to seeing what you could do in 2024. My question actually is going to be to Kevin. Kevin, you had some comments. You said you had many, many reasons to be optimistic. So, I noted the two manys there. You sort of touched on domestic plastics improving. I'd like to get some meat on the bone there with those commentaries. And then, you talked a little bit about some industrial development projects with Christina. Can you give us some numbers on what you're seeing now in terms of total projects and maybe what you had a year ago and maybe pre-pandemic?\nKevin Boone: Yeah. We're exposed to a lot of cyclical businesses and we're talking about \u2013 everybody is talking about a looming recession. Well, in my opinion, a lot of the businesses we touched have been in recession for the last year and many of them are at cyclical lows. And maybe we went beyond that with the de-stocking that occurred. So, when we talk about some of the plastics and we talk about forest products and some of these other markets, there's significant de-stocking headwinds that we've been dealing with for the past three, four quarters. And so just based on that, obviously, the comparisons get much easier from here as we look into 2024. And hopefully in a world where demand is relatively stable, that would implies, hopefully, some growth beyond just having the economy snap back a bit here. So that gives me a little bit of optimism. Obviously, if you turn the TV on right now, it can make you a little bit hesitant to be bullish. But the things that we can control, as I mentioned before, that pipeline has never been bigger. I don't think -- I've only been here for about six, seven years, but talking to the -- my colleagues that have been around a lot longer, the things that we're doing from an industrial development side, the things we're doing, working with other Class Is, the things -- you have the Western Class Is going after the Mexico business, we can participate in that. We're really happy to work with them. There's a lot of things, a lot of momentum just around us all working together to create opportunities for ourselves where I think for decades we've been pushing volume quite frankly off the railroad, on the truck. And now, we're all going to work collectively to really change that trend. And that's exciting. Forgot the second part of that question. The industrial projects, we did highlight a number of those. I think we'll put a fighter. We'll come back probably at the end of -- as we look into next year and kind of put up more numbers around that, but the activity levels are just tremendous. And then we haven't seen any slowdown. And like I said before, the biggest challenge is to create the inventory of readily available industrial sites that are shovel ready tomorrow, basically. As these companies, as we're seeing more on-shoring, we're seeing more industrial development. They want to go quickly and we've got to be ready to serve their needs. So that's the focus of this team is how can create more opportunities throughout our network to react to where they need to go and create a service so they can reach their customers. But we'll put some more numbers around that as we develop it, but the team has done a great job and we got a lot of momentum there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah, hi. I was wondering if you could maybe give some color or thoughts around the auto sector. Obviously, it's been an area of a lot of strength, the strikes, work stoppages are going on. How much cushion do you guys have relative to the inventory that's out there versus how long this drags on before it really starts to impact carloads? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Yeah, I mean, obviously, we want a quick resolution. The quicker the better. As you're probably aware of the industry as a whole has been short on car supplies. So, to some degree that's probably helping us or helping the industry to a certain degree. There're certainly some impacts to us. We're seeing strong demand in other areas where we have a diverse portfolio. So we're able to probably supply more cars to those customers that have been wanting more cars here recently and diverting some of those as we've seen some impact. But my boss here knows that industry more than anybody else and I keep on asking him every day what his thoughts are. But we'll manage through it. I think more of this is deferred revenue. And we think the demand still remains out there. So, as we move into next year, we expect to capture all the demand that exists.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, good afternoon, guys. So, Kevin, I wanted to ask you about the drivers of that domestic intermodal growth from a channel perspective. The numbers sort of turned around in week 17 and it's been pretty straightened up to the right. Is this just general stuff you're getting through traditional IMCs or is it a parcel company that's doing a little bit more over the rails? Is it a retailer that you've got a direct relationship with? Is there any one single driver of what's looking like a pretty big divergence from industry intermodal performance that we should be thinking about there in domestic intermodal?\nKevin Boone: Well, I think it's not -- there's not one single driver. It's the teams working together on the operating side and the sales and marketing side. They're going after every opportunity there is. And they're -- whether it's identifying new lanes, other things that are profitable, we're going after it right now, really being able to lean in. And I have to commend the team for their creativity, their ability to work with the -- our partners in operations and really go after things and adapt quickly and react quickly to market demand out there. So, we still have a significant value proposition even with the truck as weak as it is today. And that will only accelerate once the truck firms up a little bit here in the next year. But we're really, really proud of what they've been able to accomplish and we've got a lot of momentum around it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJames McGarragle: Hey, this is James McGarragle. I'm on for Walter today. Thanks for having me on. I wanted to ask a question on U.S. port share ship toward the U.S. East Coast and away from the U.S. West Coast over the past number of years. Given the agreements with the unions on the West Coast, do you expect this share ship to trend to -- toward the East Coast to continue? And any early indication you can share from your conversations with the shipping lines and your strategy to capitalize on these trends longer term? Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: I think you've heard it over and over again the West Coast are challenged in terms of being able to add capacity. And so there's been tremendous investments that continue to be made on the East Coast and we're the beneficiary of that. So, we'll continue to work with our East Coast ports and expect that trend to continue going forward. You also see a migration out of China and other markets. And that's also helpful for what we're seeing in terms of imports coming off from new locations that can go, that are more likely to go to the East Coast than maybe the West Coast previously. So, a lot of good momentum, a lot of significant investments being made. We're making investments alongside of them to make sure we're prepared for the growth, but it's been a great story that I don't see any reason that that won't continue going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Just a couple of questions here, one follow-up. Sorry if I missed this, but I was a little surprised to see the headwind on the accessorials get a little bit worse because it felt like you guys had a pretty good handle on that. Can you just kind of unpack that for us and kind of if that's now a final number? And also maybe for Joe, bigger picture, I know the rails are all trying to pivot very heavily towards growth, which has historically been challenging to come by. What do you think about inorganic growth potential opportunities maybe short-lanes, maybe trucking, like it -- is that something you guys looking at as well?\nSean Pelkey: Ravi, this is Sean. I'll start with the question around the accessorial. So, it's been trending down all year long. I would say we took our kind of last sequential step down from Q2 to Q3. It's a little bit more than we expected, but it wasn't just intermodal storage. There were some other components of other revenue that were down slightly. There's a lot of different things in there from subsidiary revenue to switching charges to lots of different factors. So, this is probably a good run rate to use going forward. It is also impacted by volume to a degree. So, it'll trend to a little bit higher when the intermodal volumes recover likely. But the level that we're at right now, we do think is kind of the bottom. And that's why we just didn't want to -- we wanted to make sure everybody understood where we were headed for the fourth quarter on that line.\nJoe Hinrichs: Thanks, Sean. And Ravi, just a couple of other comments from your second part of your question. I mean, at the highest level, I wouldn't think that trucking is where we would see growth. We're proud of the acquisition of Quality Carriers and how that's progressed with us at CSX. But that was very specialized to serve our chemical customers where very strong franchise and very important business to us. We'll always be opportunistic, but I wouldn't say that trucking is where the growth comes from. But just a couple of areas to highlight that we haven't been highlighted so far tonight. And first and foremost, I'll start with the fact that, I think you get the sense from this team that we firmly believe that the best way to provide opportunity for growth is to continue to provide class -- best industry-leading service to our customers. And when we do that, it gives us more and more opportunities to win business with customers. So that is the foundation of where we see growth. But you have to remember, we've been investing in the New England region, which is the old Pan Am network that we purchased. And that's going to be an opportunity for growth. We're excited about that. We're going to start a new interchange point with CPKC in Myrtlewood, Alabama. We're very excited about that opportunity. And Kevin referenced it, but I want to highlight it, in order for this industry to see significant growth, we have to work better together to be motivated to serve customers in new and better ways. And we're starting to have some of those good conversations with other Class I railroads to be able to talk and think differently about how do we serve the customer and how do we get excited about that opportunity? So, there are a number of incremental steps we can take to grow the business beyond just getting better and all the work that we're doing and the cynical nature of our business, which will be some things that should help us going into '24, as both Kevin and Sean mentioned. But those are some incremental areas that we have opportunities. And then, as our intermodal product continues to get better and we continue to be in the 95%-plus trip plan compliance reliably, repeatedly, and get to the high 90%, as the truck market starts to rebound and as costs continue to increase there, we can be even more competitive versus truck and get some more business off the road there. So, a lot of opportunity for us. We have to continue down the path we're on of continuing to provide that reliable service. But there's some exciting developments going on in addition to all the projects that are going on industrial development side, as Kevin referenced earlier, we'll provide more guidance -- maybe some more information on that, not guidance, but information on the context of that. But there are hundreds and hundreds of projects in the works in that space. So, a lot to be excited about, and really excited about the capability of our network to take advantage of that.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Hinrichs",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call today. Over this last year, CSX mission and message have remained clear and consistent. We have seen great progress with our ONE CSX initiatives, which are helping to build a focused, collaborative culture that enables all of our employees to feel engaged, energized and focused on working better together. At the same time, our service levels continue to lead the industry. These successes go hand in hand. And as our customers see that CSX is truly dedicated to providing consistent, reliable service over the long term, they're responding positively. As we look forward to all the opportunities ahead, we are confident that these efforts we are making will drive clear, sustainable, profitable growth. And we took another step forward on this path this quarter. Thanks to the hard work put in by our ONE CSX team, our railroad is running well. Our merchandise business remained steady, and our coal shipments were very strong. Our domestic intermodal volumes are growing well compared to last year. Our international intermodal business, though down year-over-year, has stabilized. Overall, our network continues to perform, and I am pleased with how the team has succeeded in managing the things that we can control. I continue to be very excited about all the potential ahead for CSX. Now, let's turn to Slide 5 to review the highlights for the third quarter. First, we moved over 1.5 million carloads this quarter, which was down just slightly from a year ago, with flat year-over-year performance in merchandise and 9% growth in coal. Our operating ratio ticked up into the low 60% as we faced challenges that we have been talking about all year, with lower fuel recovery, reduced intermodal storage revenue, lower export coal prices, and higher costs of inflation, most notably with our labor contract. As in previous quarters, our margin does include the impact of the Quality Carriers trucking business. Second, we generated $3.6 billion in revenue, which was 8% lower than the previous year. The last year we benefited from high diesel prices and record export coal benchmarks that were both much lower this quarter. Third, even with the year-over-year changes we faced, charges -- changes we faced, operating income still came in at $1.3 billion for the quarter compared to a little under $1.6 billion last year. And our earnings per share were $0.42, down from $0.52. I am proud of what we accomplished this quarter given all the challenges. None of us here are satisfied with these results. We're not sitting back and simply waiting for markets to turn. We're looking throughout the entire network to see where we can operate more efficiently. We continue to work closely with our customers to build our business pipeline and drive more volume onto the railroad. And we're emphasizing the importance of cost discipline to every team in every one of our locations. One of the reasons I am so confident about what is ahead for CSX is the great leadership team that we have in place. As you all saw last month, we are very pleased to announce that Mike Cory has joined our railroad as Chief Operating Officer. Mike brings great experience and a thorough understanding of schedule railroading, and he also shares our deep dedication and appreciation for customer service and the employees who provide that service day in and day out. Mike arrived in Jacksonville a few weeks ago and is now here joining us on this call. And so, I will now turn it over to Mike to say a few words and cover our operational performance over the quarter. All right. Thank you, Sean. Now as shown on Slide 19, we will finish with some updated comments on our outlook as we approach the final quarter of 2023. We continue to expect low single-digit growth in revenue ton-miles for the full year, supported by our consistent performance in merchandise and export coal. Automotive and minerals remain important growth areas. So, obviously, we're watching developments with the [Detroit Three] (ph) automakers and the UAW very closely. As Kevin mentioned, we also look for a substantial rebound in our ag and food business over the fourth quarter. Export coal volumes remain strong as global demand stays high for U.S. met and thermal coal. For domestic coal, we anticipate some slowdown from the third quarter, which benefited from hot summer weather, though so far this quarter we continue to be pleased with our shipment levels. For intermodal, as we mentioned, we expect domestic activity to keep gaining modest momentum through the fourth quarter. While for now, our international business looks largely stable. Overall, our volume growth rate in intermodal will reflect favorable year-over-year comparisons. As we've said all year, the pricing environment remains supportive, and we have been encouraged by the agreements that you've already reached for 2024. Note that with the slowdown in intermodal storage revenue that we have seen over the course of this year, we are now expecting supplemental revenue, excluding trucking, to decline by $325 million for the full year. Our commitment to efficiency and cost control remains in place as we keep our eye on service performance, not just in the near term, but also as we look ahead to improve market conditions and greater demand for rail capacity. Finally, our estimate of $2.3 billion in capital expenditures remains unchanged, along with our strong focus on innovation and growth. I will close by saying that I'm very proud of what we've accomplished as ONE CSX team as I finished my first year with CSX. When I spoke to all of you last fall, we talked about our belief that CSX could accomplish great things and create so much value by working better together as one team to serve our customers. We have made very good progress. And all of us know that there remains so much more we can do. I'm even more enthusiastic about our opportunities than I was last year. We all appreciate your support and interest in our company and we keep -- as we keep moving forward. All right, thank you. And Matthew, we're now ready for questions. Yeah. Chris, just the last thing I'll add is, as Mike mentioned, we're still hiring in a few key locations. That's down to a little more than a handful. And largely, we're in pretty good shape in most other spots. And with the natural attrition we have, we're still hiring to replace some of that because we are still -- our merchandise volume is up this year. So, we're still seeing some growth in volume. But we feel pretty good about our ability to manage that. And Mike has really challenged the team to come with a new set of -- fresh new set of eyes to look at how we can do some self-help to free up some of our crews to help us even be more efficient. Thanks. Yeah, to reflect on the pandemic and that's -- the domestic intermodal and our intermodal franchise performed very, very well. It really was outshined the industry in a lot of ways. What minimized our growth opportunity was really the chassis and some of the equipment limitations that existed. So, obviously, we're in a very, very different world today. And so those limitations don't exist on a year-over-year basis. And we're really seeing the team able to capitalize on that. And the strength of our service product is really coming through. When you see what we talked about in the chart that we mentioned previously is, I think all those things are coming together. Service leading in the East, and then allowing our customers to grow with us with our service product. Yeah, Ken, I just want to add a little thing. I think the timing of Mike joining us is perfect, because we've had a year of taking advantage of the operating model that we have, engaging with our employees, do a lot of things around culture and our ONE CSX. We've made tremendous progress, especially on the service metrics, as you've seen, and we have close industry-leading metrics across the board on the operating side. Now we have Mike coming in with his experience, fresh set of eyes, and all the opportunities that can now allow us to now step back and say, \"Okay, we've come this far, great work. Proud of the team's work. Now, here's the opportunity that we have to advance even further.\" And so, the timing is perfect, I think, for us. Works out very nicely. Our team is excited and motivated. You've seen now, as Kevin has highlighted many times in his comments tonight, regarding the customers have acknowledged and they acknowledge that with me all the time, the service levels that we've sustained, almost reliably now and repeatedly for 12 months. And now we have the opportunity to get more efficient and to get even better. And Mike has come in with a great attitude and excited about how we can take it to the next level and still focus, of course, on improving our service metrics, but also teaching our team, which is a relatively young team, to understand what it takes now to take a next step forward. So, we're excited about it. I'm excited about it, and I think we can continue to outpace the industry when it comes to progress on our efficiency metrics. You guys can't see it, but Mike has the shirt on, it's ONE CSX. That's what we're talking about here.

And that's the spirit of ONE CSX, focus on how on teaching and training our employees to be part of that team and to get excited by that opportunity and do it in a way that we're proud of how we work together in service of the customer. That's ONE CSX is what everyone's talking about. Thanks, Sean. And Ravi, just a couple of other comments from your second part of your question.

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you. Mike and I have been spending a lot of time together and it is really great to have you on the team. To start, I'm pleased to say that our improving service levels are a key differentiator in the marketplace. I can't thank the entire team enough for all the hard work. These improvements are being recognized by our customers and are leading to new initiatives and discussions around how CSX can partner with our customers for growth. Our ability to grow profitably requires us to be proactive, quickly adapt to changing markets, and think differently. I'm proud of how well we have been able to coordinate with operations to drive both growth and efficiencies. With Mike in his role, we have only seen these efforts accelerate. It's no surprise that overall economic conditions remain uncertain, but it has been encouraging to see gradually improving sequential trends across several of our end markets over this past quarter. We see many, many reasons to be optimistic as we continue to build our business pipeline with an eye toward 2024 and beyond. Turning to Slide 10 to look at our merchandise performance for the quarter. Our revenues were down modestly compared to last year on flat volumes, as solid core pricing gains were offset by lower fuel surcharge and negative mix effects in certain markets. Our automotive business continued to show strength with higher production and business wins driving a 19% increase in volume year-over-year. Minerals continues to perform very well, sustained by infrastructure activity that is supporting new cement facilities and healthy demand for aggregates. Metals performance has also benefited from our service levels, leading to competitive wins and solid demand. Our chemical franchise, while challenged, has begun to stabilize and even showed some promising improvement in domestic plastics over the quarter. Fertilizer revenue growth was strong in the quarter, despite volumes that were impacted by weaker short-haul movements with production challenges in Florida. As we expected, the strong Southeastern corn crop meant less rail volume for grain, and forest products remains one of the most challenged areas with many mills still taking meaningful downtime. As we start the fourth quarter, we are encouraged by the early October volume trends with most markets showing sequential momentum. We anticipate a strong rebound for ag and food as a strong Midwest harvest kicks in. And across other markets, we expect our service improvements to drive opportunities to win in the marketplace as we focus on modal conversion. Turning to Slide 11. Third quarter coal revenue declined 5%, even though volumes were very strong, growing 9% compared to last year. Export demand continued to be a major volume driver, growing 26%, with the hot summer also supporting solid domestic demand. Strong coal volumes minimize the effects of lower international benchmark prices, which were setting all-time records this time last year. The key difference was met coal pricing where global benchmarks were much lower than in the same period last year. Sequentially, our coal RPU declined 11% compared to our guidance of mid-teens decline, with stronger-than-expected shipments to longer length of haul Southern utility customers driving the moderate outperformance. Looking ahead to the last quarter of the year, we expect export markets to remain strong and are pleased with the increases in international benchmarks that we've seen over the last several weeks. On the domestic side, we have seen stockpiles normalize and demand in the 2024 will be driven by winter weather and related demand needs. The increase in global benchmark prices should benefit our cold yields next quarter. So, I would remind you that we have a diverse portfolio of met customers and we have seen U.S.-based met coal benchmarks and those in other regions lag spot prices in Australia. Turning to intermodal on Slide 12. As a whole, the business remained challenged with revenue declining by 14% and total volume decreasing by 7%. Overall, RPU declined by 8% year-over-year with the impact of lower fuel surcharge accounting for the decline, partially offset by positive price. That said, we are seeing encouraging trends from our domestic business. Our volume turned positive on a year-over-year basis early in the summer, and that's continued to improve since then. We offer a diverse mix of transportation solutions within domestic intermodal, and we've seen great results from our strong channel partnerships and our direct relationships with major retailers. Our team has been successful in converting traffic off the highway in a market facing plentiful truck capacity, which is a testament to the team in the market-leading service product. Meanwhile, international intermodal activity has stabilized but remains weak. We haven't seen any clear signs of a positive inflection yet. Retailers remain concerned about the health of the consumer. And though de-stocking may have slowed, we haven't seen this turn into sustained increases in order rates or imports. For the rest of the year, we expect trends to largely continue as they were over the third quarter, with domestic gradually strengthening, supported by our team strong sales efforts. While we prepare for the turning point for international, recall that we saw meaningful drop offs in our intermodal volume in the back half of the fourth quarter in 2022, as markets slowed substantially, which will benefit our reported growth rate for the current quarter. Slide 13 provides a clear illustration of the encouraging signs we're seeing within our intermodal business. On a year-over-year basis, domestic intermodal has shown a favorable trend since the beginning of 2023, turning positive around mid-year and steadily improving since. While international volumes remain lower compared to 2022, we've seen stability in the past few months. Altogether, across all of our businesses, our team continues to push forward across multiple initiatives, aimed at winning wallet share, converting truck traffic and bringing new customers to the railroad. We remain confident that our leading service performance will continue to provide opportunities to win business. And we know that we have the resources and capacity in place to deliver growth when the market environment inflects. I'm proud of what the collective CSX team has accomplished this quarter. I'm excited about all the potential ahead. Now, I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss financials. Yeah. I would say on the truck conversion side, we're really, really early into this thing. The good news is customers are willing to start to have those conversations that quite frankly we just couldn't have a year ago, given where we were. And so, we're building momentum. I expect this to build on itself into next year. The great thing is, I think as an industry, we're starting to become aligned in terms of going after growth, going after some of the opportunities that exist out there collectively as an industry, and I think that's very encouraging as well. But it's a mixture. It's a mixture of going after new customers. Clearly, you pointed out, the trucking market is not very supportive right now. But even in this market, we're finding customers that, with ESG and with other things, are wanting to have that discussion. There's still value that we can drive. But I only expect as that trucking market firms up in the next year and the years ahead that this will accelerate on itself and see a lot of momentum coming. Yeah. Scott, there can be a lot of mix issues within our coal business. When you think about Southern utilities, longer length of haul, higher RPU versus Northern utilities. Export coal, very, very good business, can be shorter haul, so can sometimes be a little bit lower RPU as well. But [indiscernible] given some of the benchmark strength that we've seen, I would look for something in the low-single digits, maybe mid-single digits depending on mix. Yeah. I think it's really within our merchandise portfolio and it's broad-based. There's different initiatives across the board from our metals side of the business which I highlighted. Automotive has been a good strength for us. And it's all on the back of service that's differentiated in the market, and we've really been able to capitalize on that with the customer. The customers are looking for reliable service, and I think we've been a standout in the market here year-to-date, and our team has been selling it, and it's been incredibly helpful on that side. I will say we're going to start to see some benefits of the industrial development side, more in probably the '25, '26, but you'll start to see that layer in, in late '24 and got a lot of momentum there. And again, it goes back to the service product that we've been able to deliver and getting the confidence as these industries build new plants that are locating on our railroad. So, I actually just sat down with Christina this afternoon, and we were going through all the industrial projects that have been taking place throughout the U.S. And it's interesting, you look at a map holistically throughout the U.S. and it's almost focused on the East and that's all railroad. That's where we operate and that's where our team is really going after it today. And I'm very, very optimistic on what's happening in that side. So, a lot of opportunities. They are mixed across different industries, and every industry is created a little bit different, but we are being able to lean into those conversations, quite different environment than what was occurring last year, but very, very optimistic here. Yeah. On the pricing, roughly 60% of our business reprices every year and 30% of that is kind of carryover of what we've already touched this year. So, we'll touch the other half going into next year and the environment is still supportive and it certainly helps when the service product is vastly improved. And we'll continue to price to our service levels, and those are up. And so, it's a conversation that customers expect. Our labor inflation is very visible to the world. We have those discussions. They're not unexpected from the customer. Yeah, I would just -- I would highlight that the teams, Mike's team and my team, they coordinate daily. They're speaking better than they ever have to each other. It's important from a sales and marketing perspective. You talked about can we handle an upsurge in volume demand. Well, it's up to us to communicate that real time so the team can work, make sure we're prepared for that volume, communicate with a customer, and make sure it's rateable and that we have the people in place to handle it. I think a lot of the discussions we're having right now are around that. I don't think it's rocket science to figure out where things could come back very, very quickly. We're having those discussions around creating resiliency in this network. And we're going to get together in a couple of weeks, our teams again, go through it market by market. What do we see for next year? What do we see over the next three years? And how are we going to prepare for that? And those conversations are better than they ever have been. Yeah. We're exposed to a lot of cyclical businesses and we're talking about \u2013 everybody is talking about a looming recession. Well, in my opinion, a lot of the businesses we touched have been in recession for the last year and many of them are at cyclical lows. And maybe we went beyond that with the de-stocking that occurred. So, when we talk about some of the plastics and we talk about forest products and some of these other markets, there's significant de-stocking headwinds that we've been dealing with for the past three, four quarters. And so just based on that, obviously, the comparisons get much easier from here as we look into 2024. And hopefully in a world where demand is relatively stable, that would implies, hopefully, some growth beyond just having the economy snap back a bit here. So that gives me a little bit of optimism. Obviously, if you turn the TV on right now, it can make you a little bit hesitant to be bullish. But the things that we can control, as I mentioned before, that pipeline has never been bigger. I don't think -- I've only been here for about six, seven years, but talking to the -- my colleagues that have been around a lot longer, the things that we're doing from an industrial development side, the things we're doing, working with other Class Is, the things -- you have the Western Class Is going after the Mexico business, we can participate in that. We're really happy to work with them. There's a lot of things, a lot of momentum just around us all working together to create opportunities for ourselves where I think for decades we've been pushing volume quite frankly off the railroad, on the truck. And now, we're all going to work collectively to really change that trend. And that's exciting. Forgot the second part of that question. The industrial projects, we did highlight a number of those. I think we'll put a fighter. We'll come back probably at the end of -- as we look into next year and kind of put up more numbers around that, but the activity levels are just tremendous. And then we haven't seen any slowdown. And like I said before, the biggest challenge is to create the inventory of readily available industrial sites that are shovel ready tomorrow, basically. As these companies, as we're seeing more on-shoring, we're seeing more industrial development. They want to go quickly and we've got to be ready to serve their needs. So that's the focus of this team is how can create more opportunities throughout our network to react to where they need to go and create a service so they can reach their customers. But we'll put some more numbers around that as we develop it, but the team has done a great job and we got a lot of momentum there. Yeah, I mean, obviously, we want a quick resolution. The quicker the better. As you're probably aware of the industry as a whole has been short on car supplies. So, to some degree that's probably helping us or helping the industry to a certain degree. There're certainly some impacts to us. We're seeing strong demand in other areas where we have a diverse portfolio. So we're able to probably supply more cars to those customers that have been wanting more cars here recently and diverting some of those as we've seen some impact. But my boss here knows that industry more than anybody else and I keep on asking him every day what his thoughts are. But we'll manage through it. I think more of this is deferred revenue. And we think the demand still remains out there. So, as we move into next year, we expect to capture all the demand that exists. Well, I think it's not -- there's not one single driver. It's the teams working together on the operating side and the sales and marketing side. They're going after every opportunity there is. And they're -- whether it's identifying new lanes, other things that are profitable, we're going after it right now, really being able to lean in. And I have to commend the team for their creativity, their ability to work with the -- our partners in operations and really go after things and adapt quickly and react quickly to market demand out there. So, we still have a significant value proposition even with the truck as weak as it is today. And that will only accelerate once the truck firms up a little bit here in the next year. But we're really, really proud of what they've been able to accomplish and we've got a lot of momentum around it."

            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. The third quarter operating income of $1.3 billion was lower by 18% or $284 million. These results include nearly $350 million of year-over-year impacts from lower intermodal storage revenue, export coal benchmark prices, and fuel recovery, partly offset by $42 million of favorability related to last year's labor agreement adjustment. Suffice it to say this quarter should represent the peak year-over-year impact from these discrete items. Revenue fell by 8% or $323 million despite strong pricing across many merchandise portfolio along with positive volume trends across many merchandise markets, as well as domestic intermodal. The operating team also worked tirelessly to meet customer needs and deliver a 9% increase in coal volume. Across merchandise, coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery increased 2% in the quarter and was up mid-single digits, excluding the impacts of coal RPU headwinds. Expenses were lower by 2%, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $13 million higher compared to the prior year. Income tax expense decreased $32 million as the impact of lower pre-tax earnings more than offset a prior year favorable state tax item. And this quarter's effective tax rate came in at 24.9%. As a result, earnings per share fell by $0.10, including nearly $0.12 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total third quarter expense decreased by $39 million. Lower fuel prices and cycling the prior year labor true-up were mostly offset by the impacts of inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense decreased $7 million as the prior year union labor adjustment was largely offset by inflation and increased headcount. Heightened attention to overtime benefited cost per employee, particularly in our mechanical workforce where overtime ratios are now running at multi-year lows. Purchased services and other expense increased $25 million versus last year, including $16 million associated with higher casualty expense. Turning to sequential performance versus Q2 on the right-hand side of the page, network performance and numerous cost control initiatives in the quarter drove a nearly $20 million reduction in PS&O across our operating departments. We expect these savings to remain in the fourth quarter aside from normal seasonality. Depreciation was up $21 million as a result of last year's equipment study, as well as a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $89 million, mostly driven by a lower gallon price. This was partially offset by higher consumption, including approximately 2.5 million gallons recognized from prior periods. Adjusting for this, fuel efficiency was still unfavorable versus the prior year. And Mike has brought an increased focus on this critical measure. While seasonality will impact fuel efficiency in Q4, we fully expect to get back on trend. Equipment and rents was $10 million favorable, driven by faster freight car cycle times across all markets. These benefits were partly offset by costs related to higher automotive volumes. Finally, property gains were $21 million unfavorable in the quarter. As a reminder, we are cycling over $50 million of prior year gains in Q4 and expect sales this year to be minimal. Now turning to cashflow and distributions on Slide 17. Reflecting the discrete factors I discussed earlier, free cashflow is down from the prior year, but remains strong, supporting investments in the safety and reliability of our network, as well as an increased level of high return strategic investments. Robust cashflow has also supported over $3.5 billion in shareholder returns so far this year, including $2.9 billion in share repurchases and over $650 million of dividends. Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings, is about $160 million lower year-to-date, impacted again by intermodal storage revenue and export coal pricing. Nevertheless, the focus on economic profit is helping to incent a pipeline of high return initiatives that will deliver growth and ongoing efficiency gains. Now with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Brian, on your follow-up question around cost per employee, we did -- made a lot of progress on the overtime front in the third quarter. That's an area that Mike has been focused on right from the very beginning, trying to figure out ways we can restructure the work and eliminate waste in certain locations. So that's going to help. I will say though sequentially Q3 to Q4, you probably will see still an uptick in cost per employee like we normally do. That's driven by some capital work labor that will go over to OE in the fourth quarter. We also have some seasonal vacation and some accruals that will hit in the fourth quarter. So I would say, sequentially Q3 to Q4, you'll probably see comp per employee up a few percent. Yeah. And Scott, on your question around Q4, I think you did a good job of kind of summarizing the factors. We're off to a good start in terms of the volume, and that's obviously one of the most important factors in terms of not only seeing OR stay stable to improve, but also more importantly growing our earnings. As you mentioned, fuel should be a little bit less of a negative here in Q4 than it was in Q3. We'll see what the direction of fuel prices is, but we have $30 million lag in the third quarter that we don't expect to repeat. And then in terms of the cost, seasonally, we typically do see higher costs in Q4 than Q3. So, if you were to look over the last five years, each and every one of those years, the OR has been worse in Q4 than Q3, and everything except for 2020, the COVID year, operating income has been down sequentially from the third quarter. Now, we're off to a good start like I said, and we've got our eyes fixed on places that we can eliminate waste and control costs. So I think we've got a good shot of bucking that seasonal trend and doing a little bit better than that. Yeah. Amit, obviously, we're still in the planning phases for 2024. So, I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves here. But you know the story on labor and just to make sure everybody understands and to level set, we're going to have a 4.5% wage increase mid-year next year, that's the last year of the contract with the union employees. That's a step up from the 4% increase that we had mid-year this year. In terms of PS&O, at least on the inflationary side, it's early, but I think it's fair to say that we'll start to see some normalization of the inflationary pressures from this year. So, we had mid-single digit inflation this year. It'll probably be a little bit less than that, but certainly higher than the five-year average as some of those outside service contracts are based on lagging indicators or labor indices that are going to reset. So, suffice it to say, I do think we've got fewer headwinds overall going into next year than we did going into this year. And that sets us up well. We've got cost and efficiency opportunities, but I think more importantly, Kevin and the team are building a really nice pipeline of growth that really stems from the way that we've been serving the customer over the last year. And that sustained service level as well as some of the initiatives the team has been working on, that's really what's going to drive growth as we get into next year and beyond. Yeah, Tom. So, I mean, our plan is going to be to grow volume ahead of the economy, that's what we're going to shoot for, that's what we're going to plan for. So I think if we were to have no growth next year, I think it would be tough to improve the OR with the continued inflationary pressures that we're seeing. You're cycling. We had that insurance settlement earlier in the year. So, there's a few things there. Depreciation will continue to go up, things like that. So, we need growth. That's what the model requires and that's what we're building into the plan. Kevin, I don't know if you want to address the price piece. I think you've heard it over and over again the West Coast are challenged in terms of being able to add capacity. And so there's been tremendous investments that continue to be made on the East Coast and we're the beneficiary of that. So, we'll continue to work with our East Coast ports and expect that trend to continue going forward. You also see a migration out of China and other markets. And that's also helpful for what we're seeing in terms of imports coming off from new locations that can go, that are more likely to go to the East Coast than maybe the West Coast previously. So, a lot of good momentum, a lot of significant investments being made. We're making investments alongside of them to make sure we're prepared for the growth, but it's been a great story that I don't see any reason that that won't continue going forward. Ravi, this is Sean. I'll start with the question around the accessorial. So, it's been trending down all year long. I would say we took our kind of last sequential step down from Q2 to Q3. It's a little bit more than we expected, but it wasn't just intermodal storage. There were some other components of other revenue that were down slightly. There's a lot of different things in there from subsidiary revenue to switching charges to lots of different factors. So, this is probably a good run rate to use going forward. It is also impacted by volume to a degree. So, it'll trend to a little bit higher when the intermodal volumes recover likely. But the level that we're at right now, we do think is kind of the bottom. And that's why we just didn't want to -- we wanted to make sure everybody understood where we were headed for the fourth quarter on that line."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Mike Cory",
            "content": "Well, thank you very much, Joe. And I truly appreciate the words. And I'm extremely thankful for the opportunity to work with such a committed team of people with so much potential to lead this industry with great customer service. Safety, service, efficiency, and along with engagement with each other, customers and stakeholders, is how we're going to leverage this great franchise to be best in class. And I've been here a short time, pretty much less than a month, but I've been really busy. I've visited major yards, coal export facilities, and I've spent time in headquarters meeting with an array of people from different functions of the railroad. Well, in person, I've listened to and I've spoken with employees from all across the company; from people on the ground executing the plan, from people developing the plan, to sales and marketing, finance, field and network ops, IT facilities, and the list goes on. But what really resonates with me is their collective desire to be the best they can be for our ONE CSX team and our customers. And we've got great talent in all our functions, and our job is to connect the talent and maximize the value of their efforts. We're doing this in order for our team to be the best at providing what our customers need in the safest and most efficient way. We're doing this because decision-making, acting on what they see and know, must be quick and done as close to where the opportunity is taking place. That said, I see opportunities, one of which, and to me, the most important at this stage, is to create and share a robust and visible flow of information that will derive improvement through the continuation of the lean principles that define schedule railroad. We all need to see the effects of our collective decisions as fast as possible, be more nimble and responsive to our customers' needs. As well, collectively we'll learn and share best practices throughout the organization from this and other available data as it gives us a platform to learn as it happens. This will create the speed and the trust that we need to move together as one team. So, let's go over to the slides and we'll start looking at our safety metrics. Our third quarter injury and accident rates increased as we saw track-caused and human factor incidents trend upward. These aren't acceptable outcomes for us. And we're taking action to continuously improve the environment our employees operate in, as well as the overall safety culture. Human factor incidents, especially with newly hired employees, is one of the trends this year that have driven the increase. In Q3, the team added additional time for initial training for our new conductors at our REDI Center in Atlanta. We also looked at the length of training when new hires graduate from Atlanta and report back to their home terminals and increase the length of that training as well. Increased training gives us more time to develop skills with our new hires, but we also determined we needed to place resources to spend that time with them. So, we train unionized mentors and now we have them across the property with the new hires. These mentors are available to teach and answer questions, reinforcing the ONE CSX culture by being part of developing and coaching their newly hired peers. Lastly, on safety, we're not taking our focus off life-changing events. We've partnered with DEKRA, a speciality risk management group, to rollout training to help employees self-identify risk in an ever-changing environment. Now traditionally, railroads train on operating rules, but we can't write a rule for everything or test our way to a positive safety culture. Both identification of risk and eliminating that risk when possible is one of our major goals moving into Q4 and beyond. So, let's go over to the next slide on our operating highlights. Our end-to-end train velocity averaged 17.6 miles an hour in the third quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but still up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.6 hours, an improvement of nearly 20% compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance was 94% and increased by 4 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance was 82% and improved by 25 percentage points. Our service performance remains fluid. And though we did see a slight seasonal dip during the middle of the quarter during peak vacation and holiday season, our metrics are rebounding into the fourth quarter. We all know and we will -- we all know we will and we're all working together to improve these results. Our ability to leverage this great franchise by connecting the people and the vast talent they bring will allow us to improve all key aspects of our business, with a strong focus on those lean management principles that drive reliable, consistent service. I'm really confident that connecting all of these dots together is going to result in a strong team now, and, more importantly, bench strength for the future. This is really our ONE CSX goal. And so, with that, over to you, Kevin. Hey, Chris, it's Mike. Look, and again, I'm going to preface every -- probably most of my answers with, I've been here less than a month, but we still have the training pipeline. We still have people that we need to get into position that I spoke of earlier. But overall, I'm comfortable that we have enough to improve the size of train, the amount of trains, the velocity with the people we have. But however, there are areas where we're probably getting affected somewhat on the flow of the goods. And so, it's constant. We're working -- not just Kevin and I, but our teams together. So they really get the ground floor view of what we can do. And not having been here for that long, I haven't really stretched the opportunities out there yet. So, I'd say, to answer your question, we're where we need to be. We have people that are being trained that are going to be positioned. And remember, we have attrition, whether its retirement or whatever the case. So, we're filling that. And with the people we have. We're in good shape. We have to get in better shape, and a lot of that's going to come from self-help and how we utilize the assets. Hey, Brandon. Thank you. Wow. I mentioned in my remarks, the visibility of information and it just -- it creates this connection where people see -- we have people that manage terminals, that manage the dispatch on the road, we have people that manage people from a crew management perspective, we manage -- look, we do all these things individually and to see that altogether and then again back to being understanding of what it is you can do, whether it's from a capacity or service perspective, but then cutting in with Kevin's team, we can get sticky because we can really understand all the work we're doing is really to get that business is to keep that business. And I see that here -- the opportunity here is -- look, the railway I came from, you got the business, you went 1,200, 1,500 miles and then there was more business here, it's everywhere. And it's not -- it's competitive, but there's lots of that. And Kevin -- we're not talking so much about the truck. Obviously, we're going to grow with the market and what it gives us, but I just -- I think the opportunity here when we connect our people, we are everywhere. We service, what is it, two-thirds of the U.S. market. And that's just opportunity in itself is. So, I don't know if I'm answering your question. Again, I've been here a month. But I see that, that's really what our goal is. We want to grow properly. We wanted to be ratable. We want to make sure that we're in position for it. And we're going to make sure that we rid ourselves of waste. So, we're not getting rid of the assets that we need when it does come. Thanks, Jonathan. One of the wounds just opened up. Look, it's no different. We have to be really aligned. First of all, we have to understand what our assets and our people can do for us and expand on that, obviously. But I just don't see the market, the commodities we move being the same as the growth is where I came from. And so, again, I have a long way to go to understand the market and I'm working extremely hard with Kevin to understand it. But look, the principles are the same. We sell a service, we deliver a service. And how fast we recover from any service disruptions is key to keeping the customer knowing that our goal is to be the reliable provider for them. So, I don't see any difference. And you can go back and take a look at the hockey stick recovery and all that great history, but I'm looking forward. And I don't think anything changes in my view as to how we approach this. We know what we can do, and we continue to really stay close. And again, the teams being together from the ground floor up, there shouldn't be surprises. And if there are, we're going to build our resiliency so that we can attack it again and again be reliable for the customer. So, I don't see that big of a difference in terms of the model that we have here or where we have -- wherever we have, what we had -- what I had before. It's sell the service, deliver the service. And Kevin is really working hard with his team on ratability. So, there shouldn't be surprises. Yeah, I can, thanks. Look, visibility of waste and getting it and collating that information so that I can -- what I do is I try to teach and learn, learn and teach. That's really what it's about. So, we have a good group of people, many of them younger, haven't been experienced in the positions they're in. So that's really where I've been focusing, first of all, to get a temperature read, but really start to share with them how to go about getting at that waste. And it's not easy in a network like this. And it's something that we will do as a team, but I'm not big on the next day looking at a report. I want it visible right away so they see their actions. And so, I see great opportunity in that. They're hungry to do it. They're more than motivated. And it's up to me to teach them and help them get there. And I have all the confidence in the world that's where we'll get. But we'll see just through the waste exercise at first, and then it starts to allow you to get into understanding how to devise the network to Kevin's point, to keep and even get better service and get the businesses out there. That's a tough one, Bascome. I'm still out there trying to learn. And that's important to me because I don't want to block anybody or make them feel they can't come forward with an idea. That's number one. But going forward, I want to share the experience I have so that they're incorporating that into the things they do today. And to me, we'll see improvements in all our metrics. A bigger focus on -- when I say velocity, I'm talking both trains and cars, but fluidity. And we run a pretty condensed network here. Everything is really close. We don't have, in many cases, a lot of time to recover. So, it's the plan we put into effect and the discipline about executing it. And so, what I'm trying to share with them is the availability of data and how to use it. It hasn't -- I don't see that they've had enough time. They've gone through a pretty tough period here over the last couple of years. They've rebounded extremely nicely. And to Joe's point, this is to get to the next level, so where they're self-sufficient. And I know they can be, they know they can be, but I'm here to show them that way. And maybe Kevin, if you have something to add. Yeah, and I'll just finish up. Bascome, like -- I've been, like I said, pretty much to -- well, not pretty much everywhere, but a lot of locations. And I really focus on bringing everybody that has a role in servicing the customer. I was up in Baltimore, Curtis Bay, everybody from facilities to Kevin and his marketing team, to the people that run the plant, to our engineering, mechanical, everybody has a role to play. And when they see their actions actually doing it together, they become more than customer advocates. They know and can respond to the customer much faster because they know exactly what they can offer. And so, going forward, this is not operations and marketing. No, this is CSX. This is how we approach this. This is how we build the business and keep it and drive it even better for the customer. That's what I see in three to five years."

I will now turn the call over to today\u2019s speaker Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on slide two followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on slide three. And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\nJoe Hinrichs: Thank you, Matthew, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call. Our performance over the second quarter met our expectations led by the strong results of our merchandise business. As we had indicated at year-end and again last quarter, we knew that we would have to manage through lower intermodal storage revenue and normalizing export coal prices. We expect the intermodal volume to be soft as imports slowed and destocking activity continued. That said, we also knew that we were gaining momentum with our customers, led by our improved service performance and in our own workplace as our ONE CSX efforts took hold. Our network continues to run well, and our company's initiatives combined with our employees' hard work and commitment to making a big difference and helping to set our railroad apart. There was much more to do, but our results this quarter show signs of the progress we are making as we lay the groundwork for long-term growth and value-creation. Turning to slide five. Let's review the highlights for the second quarter. We moved over 1.5 million carloads in the second quarter, led by a 3% volume growth in merchandise and 4% growth in coal, and our margins remained strong with an operating ratio below 60%, including the impact of the Quality Carriers' trucking business. We generated $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 3% lower than the previous year and flat from the first quarter. Operating income decreased 13% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and our earnings per share decreased by 9% to $0.49. When making comparisons to last year, it's important to remember that our second quarter 2022 results included a $122 million gain, representing $0.04 per share of EPS related to the Commonwealth of Virginia property sale. All in, this was a solid performance highlighted by great results in our core business. The fact that our team was able to drive 3% merchandise volume growth in such an uncertain macroeconomic market is a testament to what we are able to do when we work together. Now moving on to slide six. Earlier this month, CSX released its new 2022 ESG report, which highlights the tremendous progress that our team has made in moving our company forward. Since I started here last fall, you've heard me talk about ONE CSX, about building a supportive and positive culture and about the need to consider all of our stakeholders who are measuring our success as a company. Many of you have asked me, what this really means in practice. What does the railroad look like where its people feel valued and included, where its customers feel appreciated, and where the communities in which it operates you are respected? I think the picture and the highlight that you see here offer a small view into how we're making this happen here at CSX. To us, incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations into the priorities of our company goes hand-in-hand with our ONE CSX focus. Adding to the greater sense of purpose that we all share. These are real, authentic actions that we're taking today. We talk often about our environmental leadership and our clear advantage here over trucks as a core part of our value proposition to our customers and our shareholders. By expanding our use of technology, conducting practical testing of alternative fuels and offering support and encouragement to our suppliers, we continue to make progress. As we reported in our press release last week, we are testing biodiesel blends in locomotives in revenue service. Last month, you heard that we are in talks with CPKC to form a joint venture for the development of hydrogen-powered locomotives, which offer encouraging promise as a low emissions fuel solution. What we probably do not talk enough about are all the incredible efforts made by our railroaders, to build up the places in which we live and work. It's been a priority of ours to increase our company's positive cultural impact. And I am proud of how quickly the people in CSX have responded. As you see here, our volunteer hours are up substantially. Our CSX-sponsored community events have multiplied. And the number of people who we have been able to help and support has been incredible. I look forward to much more to come. There's one last item I'd like to mention. At CSX, safety is our top priority, and that's why we focus so much on our reported injury and accident rates. Our fundamental goal is to make sure that every one of our employees gets home safely every day. When that does not happen and we lose one of our colleagues as we lost Derek Little last month, it affects us deeply. As a reminder, why we make so much effort on safety and how much more work we need to do. Now let me turn it over to the team.\nJamie Boychuk: Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joe just said, we continue to make every effort to enhance our company's safety performance. As slide eight shows, we made good progress this quarter with both our FRA injury frequency and FRA train accident rate improving sequentially. Our injury rate also improved year-over-year and was the lowest rate for a second quarter that we've seen since 2015. Our focus is to ensure that every employee, including new hires who are less familiar, understands and appreciates their part to reinforce our safety-focused culture. Turning to slide nine. Our operating performance held up well over the second quarter and continues to lead the industry. Thanks to the hard work of our railroaders, who execute the operating plan every day. I've seen firsthand the positive response to the efforts being made by our employees to strengthen our culture. Our men and women in the field are valued, included, respected, appreciated and listen to, which helps them feel even more pride in the service they are delivering to our customers. Because of them, we're able to show how well our scheduled railroading model works, and I am excited as there are more opportunities ahead. Velocity averaged 17.7 miles per hour in the second quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.3 hours, an improvement of over 20%, compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance of 96%, increased by 6 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance of 84% improved by 25 percentage points. I'm pleased with the compliments and support we have received from our customers, regulators, and shareholders on our service improvements. Our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can continue to sustain this over time so we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss our sales and marketing performance.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jamie. As Joe noted, despite headwinds across many of our markets, the team was able to capitalize on strong year-over-year improvement in service. Importantly, as service has improved, there\u2019s opening up opportunities to discuss new business with our customers where we are seeing in our year-to-date pipeline up 30%. I'm proud of the team and the progress we have made. There remains a lot of work ahead of us as we focus on building our pipeline of growth opportunities. Initiatives including whiteboarding sessions with customers, increasing direct engagement with small and medium-sized shippers, bringing new technology tools to better serve our customers and finally, expanding our reach by leveraging our transload network and collaborating with both with our short-line and Class 1 partners are just a few of the focus areas for the team as we move into the back half of the year. Turning to slide 11. Our strong merchandise performance continued into the second quarter, with revenue increasing 5% even as our fuel surcharge declined substantially on lower diesel prices. This growth was driven by 3% higher volume, compared to last year and a 1% all-in increase in revenue per unit. As we saw in the first quarter, our customers are seeing improved service levels, which is opening up opportunities and encouraging them to bring more of their business to our network. For the quarter, we saw many of the market trends continue from the start of the year. In automotive, we are seeing more consistent production and we've seen our improved service lead to new opportunities and business wins. Minerals benefited from strong construction demand for aggregates in our improving cycle times. And our metals and equipment business continues to be a bright spot, with volumes up across steel, scrap, and equipment. We've been successful in expanding our commercial relationships and translating our service product and to convert new business wins. I'm also pleased that our fertilizer business delivered higher volumes year-over-year, supported by strong domestic shipments of potash and nitrogen. On the other side, chemicals continues to be soft as demand remains challenged across our broad book of business. Forest products. [Technical Difficulty] products faces headwinds in paper and pulpboard. We've also seen some slowdown in export grains for ag and food. For the second-half of the year, we expect to build on the successes we've had to win more wallet share of our existing customers, while continuing our efforts to attract new customers away from truck. We expect auto, minerals, and metals markets to remain supportive and will be important contributors to volume growth over the remainder of 2023. We look for destocking activity to wind down in many of the markets we serve including chemicals, so timing there remains uncertain. What's most important is that our team is not sitting back and waiting for markets to turn. We are pushing forward with our own initiatives. Our business development group has been making great progress with our Select Site program and expanding our pipeline of partner projects. And we're strategically investing in developing new locations, providing additional transloading capabilities and investing in railcars to drive more business to CSX. Turning to slide 12. Second quarter coal revenue decreased 2% as a 4% volume gain was more than offset by a 6% decline in revenue per unit, driven by lower export coal benchmarks. We saw continued growth in export volumes due to beneficial cycle times, good performance at our Curtis Bay terminal and a push among our coal customers to move more tonnage into the overseas markets. Domestic utility shipments declined as we expected, as low natural gas prices weighed on coal burn. Though demand in Southern utilities remained favorable. We expect momentum in the export markets to continue over the second-half of the year, with CSX volume supported by new mine capacity and coal producers making opportunistic shipments into the international markets. On the domestic side, we see tougher comparisons versus a strong second-half last year. But the hot summer is providing a helpful tailwind early in this quarter and just recently we are seeing a few customers looking for additional sets. Of course, as international pricing benchmarks have eased from last year's record highs, we will see an impact on our revenue per unit into the third quarter. Most of our exports are met coal with the benchmark around $225 per metric ton. We anticipate our third quarter all-in coal RPU will sequentially decline by a mid-teens percentage. Current international benchmark prices remained very healthy and supportive of strong production into the back half of the year. Now turning to slide 13. Second quarter revenue decreased by 18% due to a 10% decline in volume and a 9% reduction in revenue per unit, reflecting the effect of lower fuel surcharge. As in the first quarter, international intermodal drove most of the volume decrease with the business seeing headwinds from declining imports and inventory destocking. Volumes in the domestic business showed a much more modest decline [Technical Difficulty] by the good progress we continue to make with rail conversions and the team's efforts to identify new markets and lanes. Our best-in-class Eastern service product continues to position us for truck conversion in the quarters and years ahead. Looking forward, while we and our customers are still looking for a rebound in the international business, pressing ahead with our own initiatives, we brought on a new shipper late in the quarter that recognize the value of our strong service product. And we're seeing other opportunities in new lanes, growing activity at inland ports. Domestically, we're encouraged by many opportunities to work more closely with all of our Class 1 partners to target truck conversion. Just one example of this is the agreement we reached with CPKC just a few weeks ago to create a new interchange in Alabama that will link our customers across the Southeast with key markets in Texas and Mexico. We think there's much more opportunities for new creative partnerships that can help bring even more business to all of the railroads. And we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the second quarter results, revenue was lower by 3% or $116 million, declines in fuel recovery, other revenue, and benchmark-based export coal pricing [Technical Difficulty] benefits from strong merchandise pricing, as well as volume growth across merchandise and export coal. Operating income was down 13% to $1.5 billion, reflecting a $122 million headwind from cycling a gain on the Virginia property transaction. I'll discuss the expense line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $25 million higher compared to the prior year, and income tax expense decreased by $64 million on lower pre-tax earnings. As a result, EPS fell by $0.05, reflecting a $0.04 impact of lower property gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total second quarter expense increased $105 million. Lower fuel price was largely offset by the prior year Virginia gain. While network efficiency improvements resulted in over $20 million of cost savings across labor, PS&O, and rents, it was not enough to overcome more than $100 million of headwinds from inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $57 million, impacted by inflation and increased headcount. Importantly, service improvements are helping us get more employees home sooner, with overtime ratios down nearly 10% and a significant reduction in the number of employees tuck away from home over 24 hours. As a reminder mid-year union wage rates stepped-up by 4% on July 1, and will be reflected in our second half cost per employee. PS&O expense increased $37 million with inflation and higher repair and maintenance expense, partly offset by savings in intermodal operations and cycling of costs related to the Pan Am acquisition. While we are overhauling and rebuilding more engines than last year, locomotive efficiency was 4% improved in the quarter. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study, as well as a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $134 million driven by lower gallon price. Equipment and rents was $5 million favorable, reflecting strong improvement in car cycle times with merchandise cycles 13% better than last year. These efficiency gains more than offset costs from inflation and higher volume, particularly in the automotive market. Finally, as discussed, property gains were $117 million unfavorable in the quarter. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on slide 17. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX has generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. This has supported $2.4 billion in shareholder returns, including over $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $450 million of dividends. We were encouraged to receive recent news of a credit ratings upgrade. This move reflects the strong core cash-generating power of CSX through economic cycles, which supports our ongoing commitment to investing in the business and our balanced opportunistic approach to capital return. Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings, is up over $80 million year-to-date. While intermodal storage revenue declines in export coal headwinds we\u2019ll have a more significant year-over-year impact in the second-half, we remain committed to cultivating and investing in return-seeking projects that see the pipeline of mid and long-term growth and efficiency gains. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoe Hinrichs: Alright. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023 as shown on slide 19. First, we reiterate our expectation that revenue ton miles will grow in the low-single digits for the full-year. We remain very happy with the performance of our merchandise business through the first-half of the year and we look for volumes to be supported by continued strength in automotive, minerals and metals and the successes we've had in the marketplace. We expect full-year coal volumes to be higher, driven by strong demand for export coal. As we noted last quarter, domestic coal shipments will likely soften as demand is impacted by low natural gas prices. For intermodal, as Kevin said earlier, we have seen modest signs of improvement for domestic intermodal activity starting late in the second quarter, but there are no signs yet of a near-term recovery for the international business. We're still benefiting from a favorable pricing environment, though our expectation for $300 million decline in supplemental revenues is unchanged, with most of that year-over-year reduction occurring in the second-half of the year. Lower international met coal benchmark prices will also impact our coal revenue per unit over the remainder of the year. As before, we are making our best efforts to drive efficiency and control costs to offset real inflationary pressures, and we are committed to staying focused on improving service to our customers. And finally, we still estimate capital expenditures at $2.3 billion with a strong focus on innovation and growth. To sum up, I am proud of the progress that the ONE CSX team continues to make. There is no doubt that we face some mixed economic conditions in the near-term. However, there are so many opportunities opening up for us to win share, expand our markets and achieve profitable growth if we remain focused on safety, service, execution and working together. I am very excited about what is ahead for CSX. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone has an opportunity, we ask you to all please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Emma, we're ready to start the process.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nChris Wetherbee: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Joe, I guess maybe wanted to start with some thoughts on how you -- the second-half of the year I guess, and in particular, how you think about matching resources to the volume and revenue environment that we're in right now, as you noted you have coal, and you have other revenue headwinds that are greater on a year-over-year basis as we move into the back half of the year. Certainly, volume is still like it's a little bit uncertain, Joe, as you mentioned around the economic outlook. So how do we think about sort of managing the resources? I know service is coming back. Is it time that headcount starts to decelerate on a sequential basis? Do you think that there is more work to be done there? And conceptually, how you think about that fits in and what it may be means to profitability in the back half of the year?\nJoe Hinrichs: Thanks, Chris. It's Joe. I think at a high level, we've noted some of the things that won't repeat from last year's second-half as you referenced. So we're really focused on getting our manpower levels up to continue to sustain the improved customer service levels that we've been delivering. And Jamie highlighted the trip plan compliance in the second quarter around 84%. We've been in the 80s now pretty regularly since November of last year and that's really resonating with our customers. We're watching very carefully what's happening with the volume. And we have a mixed kind of market out there. And Kevin highlighted, we've seen growth in metals and automotive and other parts of our business. Intermodal has been softer as we highlighted. And chemicals, you know, little down, you know, we'll see when that turns. But generally speaking, our volume has been holding up on the merchandise side. We've been growing merchandise business. So we're watching the volumes very carefully and making sure that we have the staffing levels to support sustained high levels of customer service. And the reason why it's so important is that, Kevin and his team have really started to have some really good conversations with our customers. We gained share in the first-half of the year and that picked up momentum in the second quarter. And we're having very good conversations with our customers now that we're sustaining these high levels -- higher levels of service, and as Jamie noted, we want to continue to improve. But our focus is really on making sure we have the manpower to be able to sustain that. And also, at the same time, of course, if we see volume reductions further than what we're seeing right now it will respond accordingly. But right now, the volumes that we're seeing are supporting this merchandise volume growth and our high levels of service.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jon Chappell with Evercore. Your line is now open.\nJon Chappell: Thank you. Good afternoon. Sean, I wanted to ask you about the productivity improvements. In the first quarter, you said $15 million to $20 million. You said more than $20 million in the second quarter. I think the plan was to eventually get to $30 million. So I guess the question is essentially, do you get to $30 million by the back half of this year as a quarterly run rate? And kind of along the lines of Chris' question, if the volume environment is a bit softer than you had anticipated six months ago, could that $30 million even become greater as you think about 2H \u201823?\nSean Pelkey: Thanks, Jon, for your question. Yes, your recollection is right in terms of what we said first quarter. So yes, we are building some momentum with $20 million, a little over $20 million of what I would call sort of fluidity-related savings year-over-year. Now just to be clear, we aren't really counting, sort of, changes in volume in that number up or down if there's costs related to that. This is sort of independent of that. This is things like cycling the cars faster and reducing costs related to that, reducing overtime, things along those lines. We do have line of sight to that number continuing to increase over the balance of the year, and we should be in that $30 million to $40 million range in the second-half of the year is our plan, especially as we get out of summer here and labor availability starts to pick up, we get some more employees out of training. We feel pretty good about what that's going to set us up for in the second half of the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I was wondering if you could follow-up on the commentary around merchandise pricing reflecting service and a higher inflationary environment, but maybe contrasting that with the loss coal revenue and intermodal surcharges, if you could?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean when you look at our coal market, and particularly the export market, it moves with the benchmark prices. So that's something that as a swing producer keeps the producers here in the U.S. in the market, and it's worked very, very well and it's a great mechanism. We participate, obviously, when the pricing is very good. I mean it remains very, very supportive. We just had extraordinary prices last year that nobody expected would continue. But again, we participated in that. When you look across our -- the rest of our portfolio, particularly on the merchandise side, it remains supportive of the inflationary environment out there. And our customers are getting price in the market and they're not surprised that our ability to go and have those discussions are similar to what they're having with their customers. So the alignment is there. Certainly, I think the market would be -- people are looking for inflation to come down a little bit, and we'll see how the market continues. But market from a pricing perspective, both in merchandise and maybe a little bit less so in the spot market on the intermodal side, obviously, that's been a little bit softer, but still very, very healthy and will carry forward into next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon, guys. Sorry about my voice. Hopefully, you can hear me. So the coal RPU guidance was helpful. How should we think about the fuel impact in the third quarter? What are the other puts and takes as I think about operating ratio, profit Q2 to Q3? And then just like bigger picture, it feels like there's still a pretty good gap between underlying pricing and some really elevated inflation. Like, when does that normalize in your mind?\nSean Pelkey: Scott, it's Sean. Yes, so in terms of Q3 versus Q2, I mean I think step back just a minute and think about what are we ultimately trying to achieve here. We've got a service product that's -- it's well in excess of where it's been and certainly one of the best, if not the best in the industry. That's ultimately going to translate into the ability to win business off the highway and we're seeing those. We're seeing a number of those opportunities present themselves. Over time, that's going to have a really positive impact not just on margins, but also on obviously being able to grow the top and bottom line of the company. When we look at the third quarter specifically relative to the second, we've got the headwinds that Kevin talked about on coal pricing. We've had positive fuel lag all year long. We're seeing fuel prices settle a little bit here so that could be a little bit of a headwind into the third quarter. And then as I mentioned, we've got the union wage rate increases of 4%. So that will add some costs. In terms of the second-half of your question, the gap between pricing and inflation. We're seeing mid-single-digit inflation across both labor and fringe and purchase services and other. That's going to persist here for the balance of the year. We've got a clean line of sight into the labor line. And most of the PS&O is essentially set for the year from a rate perspective. I would also say, and Kevin can chime in if there's additional info, but I think most of the pricing for the year has been done. We'll start to get into pricing for next year as we get towards the end of the year. And so far, conversations have been -- continue to be very supportive.\nKevin Boone: Yeah, I think that's right. We've seen the pricing reflect the inflationary environment. And there's multiyear contracts that we'll still have to touch at the back half of this year that probably need a little bit of catch-up. But beyond that, I think it's well in line with what the inflationary market is out there, particularly on the merchandise business today.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Hey. Great. Good afternoon. So just to understand this environment, Joe or maybe Kevin, as you move into the third quarter, you're targeting -- still targeting low-single-digit revenue ton-mile growth. I guess you're running about 2% or so year-to-date. So do you think that moves negative based on the current weak volumes that we're seeing so far right now? And then if we do get that weak environment that we're talking about, can you still improve operating ratio as we move into the third quarter if you're looking at revenue stay above cost of inflation? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think, Ken, you'll remember, I think as you move into the back half of the year and as you enter into the fourth quarter, we're also going to lap a lot of easier comps, whether it's the international intermodal market or some of the markets that we saw. Some order softness begin in September and really carry through the fourth quarter. So I would say things will probably trend positively through the quarter, which will be helpful from a revenue -- RTM growth perspective. Coal is a dynamic market right now. Look, two weeks, three weeks ago before this hot summer started probably a little bit lower outlook for domestic coal business. But just recently, we're getting a lot more interest and a lot more inbounds on what we can do given some of the heatwaves we're having. In fact, I think we got a heat warning here in Jacksonville this afternoon. So things have been hot. Obviously, that's supportive of that market. And so things can change -- are very dynamic and can change quickly. The destocking, I think, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. We've seen destocking for a while in some of these markets. I don't -- I can't call the month or the quarter of when that stops, but there's many markets right now where we're underrunning I think, the demand that's out there in the business. So once that normalizes to the underlying demand in the economy, I think that's an opportunity for us, too. And I'm hopeful that as we move into the fourth quarter, we'll see some of those dynamics play out. And then as Joe pointed out, there's -- the team has been doing a fantastic job. And some of the efforts and some of the collaboration that we've had with Jamie and his team on the operations side is resulting in wins and those start to layer in as we move through the year and into next year, and you'll start to see that in our business as well.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. And Ken, just on the second part of your question, I think the commentary you heard from Kevin suggests we're not calling a pullback in volumes. But to the extent that the macro presents something like that, there's things that we can do, there's levers that we can pull. And certainly, we would look to do that but not to jeopardize the ability to continue to gain momentum and gain share off of the truck, which is the ultimate goal here to kind of grow the pie and grow our profitability.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So maybe just on the topic of truckload conversion, it's been mentioned several times on the call. Obviously, it's a big opportunity. But can you give us any context in terms of the wins you're getting or you have line of sight to? Would you be able to quantify that at some point in time because clearly, making the long-term decision to go after that and sounds like you're getting some -- but it's hard to say what relative size that could be? And then, Sean, if you could just clarify cost per employee that we should expect for the next quarter? I know payments go up or the wages go up another 4%, but you got mix over time, a few other things in there as well. So it would be helpful if you can clarify that, too. Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think in terms of numbers, we'll probably put a finer point on the truck conversion opportunity over the next three years at some time in the future. There's a huge focus by the team to really look at our pipeline and measure it and focus on those customers where there's an opportunity. And some customers have a lot more opportunities than others and making sure we have the resources up against those customers to really drive that conversion. So a lot of activity. We have a lot of new tools internally that we're focused on in terms of measuring that. So our data is getting better and better every day, and there's a lot of momentum. And as I mentioned, our pipeline, as we measure it on a year-over-year basis, is up significantly, up 30%. On a dollar volume perspective, it's up even more than that. So a lot of momentum building. Obviously, the trucking market is not the most receptive market to compete against right now. Hopefully, there's some optimism that's firming up here, and that will even drive more opportunities as we work with customers over the next few months to drive more opportunities. And we're upwards of 25 whiteboarding sessions year-to-date, and those are driving a lot of opportunities. They don't necessarily come to fruition tomorrow. But over the next couple of quarters, we think those are going to translate into a lot of opportunities to shift share from truck as well. So we're -- teams are very, very excited. I don't think we've had this much of momentum in terms of the things that we can control going forward. It's just some of these markets obviously are against us right now. Over to you, Sean.\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. Thanks. And in terms of cost per employee, it should be fairly stable other than the 4% wage increase on the union piece. I think there are some opportunities to drive some efficiencies there. So we hope to do better than a 4% increase from the first-half to the second-half, but we'll certainly feel the impact of higher wages.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Your line is open.\nJustin Long: Thanks. I wanted to ask about intermodal, because there's a big divergence between the domestic intermodal and international intermodal volume trends. And I was wondering if you could share how those numbers compared in the second quarter. And looking into the back half, around your comment about the domestic intermodal market gaining momentum. Is that a function of demand getting better or your expectation for business wins starting to kick in? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think when you look at the second quarter, think about the international market being down in that high-teens range. We probably, from a bottom perspective, peak that down in that mid-20s, and it's improved slightly from there. So our exit rate is a little bit better than what we saw middle of the quarter. What we saw through the quarter on the domestic side is sequential improvement month-over-month or on a year-over-year basis each month as we get to move through the quarter. So that gives us optimism there. The team has done, quite frankly, a fantastic job of introducing some new lanes, working with some of our Class 1 partners to do that and identify new business. And some of those things are really playing out. Some of our partners have done really, really well in the market despite some of the, obviously, headwinds there. So working with them, identifying markets where we have some opportunities. And in these kind of markets, it gives you more flexibility to go out there and look at things, look at your network, identify opportunities, try things out that work -- may work and really go after it. So that's what the team has been using the softness in the market to go and do and set us up for growth as the market rebounds. And I think you're starting to see that in the numbers here.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Your line is now open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Great. Good afternoon. Appreciate it. I know you've got a lot of questions, Kevin, on volume. And maybe there's not -- it's tough not to have a clear crystal ball in this type of environment. But I guess, how do you think about the kind of -- you've got good momentum with the service, good discussions with customers. You're talking about the pipeline is good. If we see some improvement get beyond inventory reduction, just see a bit of improvement in demand, do you think you're going to see maybe a bigger cyclical swing up and maybe more evidence of some of that truck conversion coming through? Or, I guess I'm just trying to think about -- we know it's a tough rate backdrop, but what is -- how do these things translate when you see some improvement in markets? Is it mid-single digit volumes higher? How do you think about that potential framework maybe looking at a little ways?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I probably won't put numbers around it, but there's a reason we're hiring. There's -- we see all the things that we can control internally, setting us up nicely for when the markets rebound. And yes, I think the combination of markets returning at least to -- in some cases, just the current demand levels is going to create a lot of leverage in our business to do that. And I think you'll see some of these businesses where we're having discussions around truck conversion as the market firms up, more willing to move that freight back over to rail or move it to rail for the first time. So it's -- the pipeline takes a while to build up. It's been -- as Joe was pointing out earlier, it's been about nine months since we've seen that rail improvement. And the customers are reacting to it, some sooner than others. But yeah, that's the idea of all these investments, obviously, will help us participate when that cyclical upside starts to occur.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Fadi Chamoun with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nFadi Chamoun: Yes. Thank you. My question on the service level, like obviously, you have done a great job in rebuilding the service and doing the -- a comprehensive work on building the culture to sustain that longer term. But as we know, like some of the service issues we saw in the last two or three years were all rail related. You had obviously a lot of friction coming to you from outside of your own network. I'm just wondering, how are you kind of thinking about some of these problems that are affecting your service from outside your network. Some of these partnerships that Kevin talked about, try to kind of iron out some of these friction areas that you see in the supply chain? Or are there opportunities to kind of build the service level that can be sustained even as demand comes back, which historically has been a challenge to service levels?\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Joe. You're right. Over the last several years, supply chain across the globe was challenged, and we certainly felt the effects of some of that. We've got some benefits from that on the supplemental revenue side of things because things were going up in storage. But generally speaking, from a customer standpoint, it definitely impacted everyone. And as we've noted in the past, around 40% of what we moved on the carload side touches another rail provider. So interchanges are important and the overall service levels of the partners we have across the Class I rails is really important. If you think about going forward, the ports aren't congested as much as they were, and we don't have a lot of the network all gummed up in the intermodal facilities and et cetera. So we should be able to run more fluidly when the market comes back on the intermodal side especially. So I think from a customer perspective, the things that have calmed down help. And as our Class 1 rail partners continue to improve their service, the collective service that we give to the customer holistically will improve as well, which -- that's an opportunity for the whole industry going forward. That's the way we're thinking about it. We can control our piece of it, and we want to keep getting better and more repeatable and more predictable and also working with our Class I rail partners to do the same. At the same time, the other parts of the business have also freed up -- so as Kevin was alluding to, when that market comes back, we'll have the manpower levels, and we'll have the fluidity in our network and the system overall should be able to handle it in a better way, which should be better for the overall economy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nAmit Mehrotra: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Kevin, can you just talk about the direction of travel for non-coal yield? I just would have expected a little bit of a better performance in the second quarter sequentially. I know there was a few headwinds that's pretty severe incrementally, that fuel headwind kind of moderates in 3Q. So just wondering what the direction of travel on that is. And then Sean, you made some good progress on PS&O costs in the quarter relative to, I guess, that insurance gain adjusted first quarter. I know you've got some like leases that are expiring around intermodal container storage jars and things like that in the back half. What's the right way to think about PS&O coming down in the back half relative to what you did in the second quarter? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Yes. Obviously, putting coal aside, obviously, that we've talked about on the international side. When you look at yield broadly, there's always mix, right? And when you look at our merchandise business, in general, one of the markets we've highlighted is obviously under cyclical pressure right now is the chemical market, which typically has a higher RPU. So that's weighed on the overall benefit you've seen from the merchandise side, and there's a lot of moving parts within it. But if you look at what we were able to achieve within the individual markets is quite healthy I think despite some of the fuel surcharge headwinds that you saw. The intermodal market obviously is unique, given some of the challenges on the truck and what we have to do there, particularly on the spot market. But again, fuel surcharge is a much larger impact there. And absent that, you saw a flattish-type RPU, and that was mainly impacted by some of our longer-term contracts, obviously had positive rate. But on the flip side, some of the spot markets saw some significant downgrade along with the truck. But the market held in, obviously, a lot better than some of the trucking rates out there and what the markets do there. But overall, I was very pleased in some of the NPA results as we measure it or some of the highest results that we've seen in a long time, if you look broadly across the markets.\nSean Pelkey: And Amit, your question on PS&O, I'm always hesitant to predict that line, because there's a number of different puts and takes within it that can impact the quarter. I will say that we are very -- we're focused on cost control and we're making sure that we've got only the costs that are necessary in order to move the volume to the extent that intermodal volumes pick up a little bit, that will have an impact on PS&O costs. But outside of volume-related expenses, I would fully expect that we'd be able to, kind of, hold the line on the improvement that you saw in the second quarter in PS&O going forward. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis for the second-half, that means we'll probably be able to absorb most of the inflationary impact in the second half, notwithstanding any sort of volume-related impacts that we might see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open.\nDavid Vernon: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for the call and thanks for taking the question. So Kevin, just to kind of dig into the mid-teens guidance for RPU sequentially. Does that kind of bring us to mark-to-market for $225? And then how do we think about the sensitivity? Can we extrapolate that sensitivity going forward if we're going to expect sort of benchmark pricing to either go up or down? Is that a good way to think about the sensitivity on further price changes? Because $225 was still, call it, $75 above the long-run average in the prior decade.\nKevin Boone: Yes, I think that's fair. Obviously, there's bottoms, right, and there's -- we protect ourselves both on the bottom and then on the top end. We don't participate in some of the extreme stream cases, but I think that's fair. $225 is kind of embedded in what we're coming into the quarter. We've seen a little bit of positive uplift in that so even as recently as the last couple of days. So we'll see where that trends. But we've seen a lot of stability, if not a little slight uptick in that market here recently, and we'll see what the fourth quarter brings.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nPaul Stoddard: Hi. This is Paul Stoddard on for Jordan. I guess with the recent agreement on the West Coast for the Long shoremen, there's some anticipation that there could be some more freight being diverted back to the West Coast. I guess how are you thinking about that in terms of international intermodal long-term? And do you think that's going to be offset by domestic intermodal? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: I think the long-term trend, if you just go to Charleston, you go to Savannah and you look at all the investments being made, there's a long-term growth opportunity on the East Coast and you'll continue to see our growth in the East Coast, which we'll continue to serve and benefit from. Some stability on the West Coast is going to be helpful. As you know, a lot of our international business still comes across the West through Chicago and other interchange points. And unfortunately, a lot of that volume given some of the congestion on the West was either trucked, and we didn't see that volume. So as that -- we should benefit from a recovery there. So I don't see it as necessarily taking share away from what we're doing in the East, more as something that -- obviously, if the rails in the West begin to perform better on a year-over-year basis will benefit the Eastern network and some of that traffic coming to us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nAllison Poliniak: Hi, good evening. Just want to go back to Brian's question on modal conversion. When you talk to customers that aren't quite ready to convert yet, is it simply price that's holding them back? Or is there something from a service perspective that they're looking for you to provide that's just not quite there yet? Just any thoughts on that. Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Look, I think the most important thing for a customer is reliability, right? And in some customers' eyes, they want to see more of that reliability. They like what they see today. We've got to continue to perform and have those conversations. And sometimes it's lane-by-lane. It's carload-by-carload where we get that confidence from a customer. And so we're in the very early innings of this, and we feel the acceleration from first quarter to second quarter, and I expect those conversations to pick up even more in the third and fourth quarters as we continue to perform. Sharing what we're doing on the hiring side is incredibly helpful. Sharing with them what we plan to do to make our network more resilient, winning their confidence, but that's the number one issue. It's not price. 99% of the time, we have a pricing advantage versus our truck competitor. So that's the opportunity for us. We have the environmental advantages. So we have all these things, we've just got to get the reliability and prove that the reliability is sustainable.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin: Thanks very much, operator. I just wanted to shift focus from -- the pipeline looks really good, Kevin, and presumably that's merchandise base mainly. But looking into 2024 on some of your bulk areas and in particular, ag and coal, the EIA has just revised downward its forecast for next year by quite a bit? And then on the ag side, it looks like there's some severe drought conditions forming that's going to impact the current growing season. So looking into 2024, I mean that suggests that we could be bracing for some down double digit volume growth in those two categories. Is there any offsets there that you would flag for next year that would offset some of those fairly negative forecast for those two particular commodities?\nKevin Boone: Well, really hot summer certainly doesn't hurt and that's what we're in the middle of. Obviously, from a coal perspective and you're referencing mainly the domestic side, that's obviously dependent on the weather conditions and the weather I think is a surprise from a heat perspective to the upside here over the last few weeks. And we're seeing that with a lot of our customers running full out here and replenishing some of the inventory levels. And so we'll see how the winter plays out. I think it's really, really early in July to call 2024. That seems a bit premature to me. We see a very healthy export market as well. Obviously, that's driven by global macro conditions. But we have new supply coming online that will ramp up next year. That supply is going to land in the market. It's very competitive in the market, and we expect to participate in it. Many of the mines that we serve are going to be in the market almost no matter what conditions. So we see the volume there sustainable. On the ag side, again, I followed these markets for a long time. I think July is a little bit premature as well. It has been hot out there. We'll see how the market firms up here, but there's a lot of moving parts. We're seeing a little bit of weakness here in the third quarter, but we see some good indications into the fourth quarter. So we'll see how that trends, and we'll watch the crop conditions as you are to see how that moves into the back half of the year. Obviously, we don't have as large of a franchise on that side as some of the other railroads, particularly in the West from an export perspective. So a little less exposure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nElliot Alper: Great. Thank you. This is Elliot Alper on for Jason. On the international intermodal side, last quarter, you talked about how some of your larger customers were expecting a pickup in the back half of the year. So I guess, what have your customers said that has changed over the past three months that has resulted in no inflection yet? Maybe there's been any change in view into peak season? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: I don't -- I wouldn't read any of our comments that there's been any type of inflection down. We're just -- I don't think there's -- we're seeing in real-time an inflection up in the market. And I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we obviously start to lap a lot easier comps on a year-over-year basis. So I think from a overall growth perspective, fourth quarter will be a much easier comp than what we've seen throughout the year. And hopefully, that momentum will carry into next year. But there's no indications that the market is necessarily picking up. I don't -- I think we bottomed from that perspective. The question is how quickly the market recovers. And that will be heavily relying on the consumer and how that pans out into the holiday season going forward.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our Q&A session for today and today's conference call.

            "name": "Jamie Boychuk",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. As Joe just said, we continue to make every effort to enhance our company's safety performance. As slide eight shows, we made good progress this quarter with both our FRA injury frequency and FRA train accident rate improving sequentially. Our injury rate also improved year-over-year and was the lowest rate for a second quarter that we've seen since 2015. Our focus is to ensure that every employee, including new hires who are less familiar, understands and appreciates their part to reinforce our safety-focused culture. Turning to slide nine. Our operating performance held up well over the second quarter and continues to lead the industry. Thanks to the hard work of our railroaders, who execute the operating plan every day. I've seen firsthand the positive response to the efforts being made by our employees to strengthen our culture. Our men and women in the field are valued, included, respected, appreciated and listen to, which helps them feel even more pride in the service they are delivering to our customers. Because of them, we're able to show how well our scheduled railroading model works, and I am excited as there are more opportunities ahead. Velocity averaged 17.7 miles per hour in the second quarter, slightly lower than last quarter, but up substantially from the same period in 2022. Dwell averaged 9.3 hours, an improvement of over 20%, compared to the same period last year. Intermodal trip plan performance of 96%, increased by 6 percentage points year-over-year, while carload trip plan performance of 84% improved by 25 percentage points. I'm pleased with the compliments and support we have received from our customers, regulators, and shareholders on our service improvements. Our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can continue to sustain this over time so we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss our sales and marketing performance."

            "name": "Joe Hinrichs",
            "content": "Thank you, Matthew, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining our conference call. Our performance over the second quarter met our expectations led by the strong results of our merchandise business. As we had indicated at year-end and again last quarter, we knew that we would have to manage through lower intermodal storage revenue and normalizing export coal prices. We expect the intermodal volume to be soft as imports slowed and destocking activity continued. That said, we also knew that we were gaining momentum with our customers, led by our improved service performance and in our own workplace as our ONE CSX efforts took hold. Our network continues to run well, and our company's initiatives combined with our employees' hard work and commitment to making a big difference and helping to set our railroad apart. There was much more to do, but our results this quarter show signs of the progress we are making as we lay the groundwork for long-term growth and value-creation. Turning to slide five. Let's review the highlights for the second quarter. We moved over 1.5 million carloads in the second quarter, led by a 3% volume growth in merchandise and 4% growth in coal, and our margins remained strong with an operating ratio below 60%, including the impact of the Quality Carriers' trucking business. We generated $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 3% lower than the previous year and flat from the first quarter. Operating income decreased 13% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and our earnings per share decreased by 9% to $0.49. When making comparisons to last year, it's important to remember that our second quarter 2022 results included a $122 million gain, representing $0.04 per share of EPS related to the Commonwealth of Virginia property sale. All in, this was a solid performance highlighted by great results in our core business. The fact that our team was able to drive 3% merchandise volume growth in such an uncertain macroeconomic market is a testament to what we are able to do when we work together. Now moving on to slide six. Earlier this month, CSX released its new 2022 ESG report, which highlights the tremendous progress that our team has made in moving our company forward. Since I started here last fall, you've heard me talk about ONE CSX, about building a supportive and positive culture and about the need to consider all of our stakeholders who are measuring our success as a company. Many of you have asked me, what this really means in practice. What does the railroad look like where its people feel valued and included, where its customers feel appreciated, and where the communities in which it operates you are respected? I think the picture and the highlight that you see here offer a small view into how we're making this happen here at CSX. To us, incorporating environmental, social and governance considerations into the priorities of our company goes hand-in-hand with our ONE CSX focus. Adding to the greater sense of purpose that we all share. These are real, authentic actions that we're taking today. We talk often about our environmental leadership and our clear advantage here over trucks as a core part of our value proposition to our customers and our shareholders. By expanding our use of technology, conducting practical testing of alternative fuels and offering support and encouragement to our suppliers, we continue to make progress. As we reported in our press release last week, we are testing biodiesel blends in locomotives in revenue service. Last month, you heard that we are in talks with CPKC to form a joint venture for the development of hydrogen-powered locomotives, which offer encouraging promise as a low emissions fuel solution. What we probably do not talk enough about are all the incredible efforts made by our railroaders, to build up the places in which we live and work. It's been a priority of ours to increase our company's positive cultural impact. And I am proud of how quickly the people in CSX have responded. As you see here, our volunteer hours are up substantially. Our CSX-sponsored community events have multiplied. And the number of people who we have been able to help and support has been incredible. I look forward to much more to come. There's one last item I'd like to mention. At CSX, safety is our top priority, and that's why we focus so much on our reported injury and accident rates. Our fundamental goal is to make sure that every one of our employees gets home safely every day. When that does not happen and we lose one of our colleagues as we lost Derek Little last month, it affects us deeply. As a reminder, why we make so much effort on safety and how much more work we need to do. Now let me turn it over to the team. Alright. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023 as shown on slide 19. First, we reiterate our expectation that revenue ton miles will grow in the low-single digits for the full-year. We remain very happy with the performance of our merchandise business through the first-half of the year and we look for volumes to be supported by continued strength in automotive, minerals and metals and the successes we've had in the marketplace. We expect full-year coal volumes to be higher, driven by strong demand for export coal. As we noted last quarter, domestic coal shipments will likely soften as demand is impacted by low natural gas prices. For intermodal, as Kevin said earlier, we have seen modest signs of improvement for domestic intermodal activity starting late in the second quarter, but there are no signs yet of a near-term recovery for the international business. We're still benefiting from a favorable pricing environment, though our expectation for $300 million decline in supplemental revenues is unchanged, with most of that year-over-year reduction occurring in the second-half of the year. Lower international met coal benchmark prices will also impact our coal revenue per unit over the remainder of the year. As before, we are making our best efforts to drive efficiency and control costs to offset real inflationary pressures, and we are committed to staying focused on improving service to our customers. And finally, we still estimate capital expenditures at $2.3 billion with a strong focus on innovation and growth. To sum up, I am proud of the progress that the ONE CSX team continues to make. There is no doubt that we face some mixed economic conditions in the near-term. However, there are so many opportunities opening up for us to win share, expand our markets and achieve profitable growth if we remain focused on safety, service, execution and working together. I am very excited about what is ahead for CSX. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions. Thanks, Chris. It's Joe. I think at a high level, we've noted some of the things that won't repeat from last year's second-half as you referenced. So we're really focused on getting our manpower levels up to continue to sustain the improved customer service levels that we've been delivering. And Jamie highlighted the trip plan compliance in the second quarter around 84%. We've been in the 80s now pretty regularly since November of last year and that's really resonating with our customers. We're watching very carefully what's happening with the volume. And we have a mixed kind of market out there. And Kevin highlighted, we've seen growth in metals and automotive and other parts of our business. Intermodal has been softer as we highlighted. And chemicals, you know, little down, you know, we'll see when that turns. But generally speaking, our volume has been holding up on the merchandise side. We've been growing merchandise business. So we're watching the volumes very carefully and making sure that we have the staffing levels to support sustained high levels of customer service. And the reason why it's so important is that, Kevin and his team have really started to have some really good conversations with our customers. We gained share in the first-half of the year and that picked up momentum in the second quarter. And we're having very good conversations with our customers now that we're sustaining these high levels -- higher levels of service, and as Jamie noted, we want to continue to improve. But our focus is really on making sure we have the manpower to be able to sustain that. And also, at the same time, of course, if we see volume reductions further than what we're seeing right now it will respond accordingly. But right now, the volumes that we're seeing are supporting this merchandise volume growth and our high levels of service. Yes. Thanks for the question. This is Joe. You're right. Over the last several years, supply chain across the globe was challenged, and we certainly felt the effects of some of that. We've got some benefits from that on the supplemental revenue side of things because things were going up in storage. But generally speaking, from a customer standpoint, it definitely impacted everyone. And as we've noted in the past, around 40% of what we moved on the carload side touches another rail provider. So interchanges are important and the overall service levels of the partners we have across the Class I rails is really important. If you think about going forward, the ports aren't congested as much as they were, and we don't have a lot of the network all gummed up in the intermodal facilities and et cetera. So we should be able to run more fluidly when the market comes back on the intermodal side especially. So I think from a customer perspective, the things that have calmed down help. And as our Class 1 rail partners continue to improve their service, the collective service that we give to the customer holistically will improve as well, which -- that's an opportunity for the whole industry going forward. That's the way we're thinking about it. We can control our piece of it, and we want to keep getting better and more repeatable and more predictable and also working with our Class I rail partners to do the same. At the same time, the other parts of the business have also freed up -- so as Kevin was alluding to, when that market comes back, we'll have the manpower levels, and we'll have the fluidity in our network and the system overall should be able to handle it in a better way, which should be better for the overall economy."

            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. As Joe noted, despite headwinds across many of our markets, the team was able to capitalize on strong year-over-year improvement in service. Importantly, as service has improved, there's opening up opportunities to discuss new business with our customers where we are seeing in our year-to-date pipeline up 30%. I'm proud of the team and the progress we have made. There remains a lot of work ahead of us as we focus on building our pipeline of growth opportunities. Initiatives including whiteboarding sessions with customers, increasing direct engagement with small and medium-sized shippers, bringing new technology tools to better serve our customers and finally, expanding our reach by leveraging our transload network and collaborating with both with our short-line and Class 1 partners are just a few of the focus areas for the team as we move into the back half of the year. Turning to slide 11. Our strong merchandise performance continued into the second quarter, with revenue increasing 5% even as our fuel surcharge declined substantially on lower diesel prices. This growth was driven by 3% higher volume, compared to last year and a 1% all-in increase in revenue per unit. As we saw in the first quarter, our customers are seeing improved service levels, which is opening up opportunities and encouraging them to bring more of their business to our network. For the quarter, we saw many of the market trends continue from the start of the year. In automotive, we are seeing more consistent production and we've seen our improved service lead to new opportunities and business wins. Minerals benefited from strong construction demand for aggregates in our improving cycle times. And our metals and equipment business continues to be a bright spot, with volumes up across steel, scrap, and equipment. We've been successful in expanding our commercial relationships and translating our service product and to convert new business wins. I'm also pleased that our fertilizer business delivered higher volumes year-over-year, supported by strong domestic shipments of potash and nitrogen. On the other side, chemicals continues to be soft as demand remains challenged across our broad book of business. Forest products. [Technical Difficulty] products faces headwinds in paper and pulpboard. We've also seen some slowdown in export grains for ag and food. For the second-half of the year, we expect to build on the successes we've had to win more wallet share of our existing customers, while continuing our efforts to attract new customers away from truck. We expect auto, minerals, and metals markets to remain supportive and will be important contributors to volume growth over the remainder of 2023. We look for destocking activity to wind down in many of the markets we serve including chemicals, so timing there remains uncertain. What's most important is that our team is not sitting back and waiting for markets to turn. We are pushing forward with our own initiatives. Our business development group has been making great progress with our Select Site program and expanding our pipeline of partner projects. And we're strategically investing in developing new locations, providing additional transloading capabilities and investing in railcars to drive more business to CSX. Turning to slide 12. Second quarter coal revenue decreased 2% as a 4% volume gain was more than offset by a 6% decline in revenue per unit, driven by lower export coal benchmarks. We saw continued growth in export volumes due to beneficial cycle times, good performance at our Curtis Bay terminal and a push among our coal customers to move more tonnage into the overseas markets. Domestic utility shipments declined as we expected, as low natural gas prices weighed on coal burn. Though demand in Southern utilities remained favorable. We expect momentum in the export markets to continue over the second-half of the year, with CSX volume supported by new mine capacity and coal producers making opportunistic shipments into the international markets. On the domestic side, we see tougher comparisons versus a strong second-half last year. But the hot summer is providing a helpful tailwind early in this quarter and just recently we are seeing a few customers looking for additional sets. Of course, as international pricing benchmarks have eased from last year's record highs, we will see an impact on our revenue per unit into the third quarter. Most of our exports are met coal with the benchmark around $225 per metric ton. We anticipate our third quarter all-in coal RPU will sequentially decline by a mid-teens percentage. Current international benchmark prices remained very healthy and supportive of strong production into the back half of the year. Now turning to slide 13. Second quarter revenue decreased by 18% due to a 10% decline in volume and a 9% reduction in revenue per unit, reflecting the effect of lower fuel surcharge. As in the first quarter, international intermodal drove most of the volume decrease with the business seeing headwinds from declining imports and inventory destocking. Volumes in the domestic business showed a much more modest decline [Technical Difficulty] by the good progress we continue to make with rail conversions and the team's efforts to identify new markets and lanes. Our best-in-class Eastern service product continues to position us for truck conversion in the quarters and years ahead. Looking forward, while we and our customers are still looking for a rebound in the international business, pressing ahead with our own initiatives, we brought on a new shipper late in the quarter that recognize the value of our strong service product. And we're seeing other opportunities in new lanes, growing activity at inland ports. Domestically, we're encouraged by many opportunities to work more closely with all of our Class 1 partners to target truck conversion. Just one example of this is the agreement we reached with CPKC just a few weeks ago to create a new interchange in Alabama that will link our customers across the Southeast with key markets in Texas and Mexico. We think there's much more opportunities for new creative partnerships that can help bring even more business to all of the railroads. And we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead of us. Now I will turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials. Yes. I mean when you look at our coal market, and particularly the export market, it moves with the benchmark prices. So that's something that as a swing producer keeps the producers here in the U.S. in the market, and it's worked very, very well and it's a great mechanism. We participate, obviously, when the pricing is very good. I mean it remains very, very supportive. We just had extraordinary prices last year that nobody expected would continue. But again, we participated in that. When you look across our -- the rest of our portfolio, particularly on the merchandise side, it remains supportive of the inflationary environment out there. And our customers are getting price in the market and they're not surprised that our ability to go and have those discussions are similar to what they're having with their customers. So the alignment is there. Certainly, I think the market would be -- people are looking for inflation to come down a little bit, and we'll see how the market continues. But market from a pricing perspective, both in merchandise and maybe a little bit less so in the spot market on the intermodal side, obviously, that's been a little bit softer, but still very, very healthy and will carry forward into next year. Yeah, I think that's right. We've seen the pricing reflect the inflationary environment. And there's multiyear contracts that we'll still have to touch at the back half of this year that probably need a little bit of catch-up. But beyond that, I think it's well in line with what the inflationary market is out there, particularly on the merchandise business today. Yes. I think, Ken, you'll remember, I think as you move into the back half of the year and as you enter into the fourth quarter, we're also going to lap a lot of easier comps, whether it's the international intermodal market or some of the markets that we saw. Some order softness begin in September and really carry through the fourth quarter. So I would say things will probably trend positively through the quarter, which will be helpful from a revenue -- RTM growth perspective. Coal is a dynamic market right now. Look, two weeks, three weeks ago before this hot summer started probably a little bit lower outlook for domestic coal business. But just recently, we're getting a lot more interest and a lot more inbounds on what we can do given some of the heatwaves we're having. In fact, I think we got a heat warning here in Jacksonville this afternoon. So things have been hot. Obviously, that's supportive of that market. And so things can change -- are very dynamic and can change quickly. The destocking, I think, I mentioned it in my prepared remarks. We've seen destocking for a while in some of these markets. I don't -- I can't call the month or the quarter of when that stops, but there's many markets right now where we're underrunning I think, the demand that's out there in the business. So once that normalizes to the underlying demand in the economy, I think that's an opportunity for us, too. And I'm hopeful that as we move into the fourth quarter, we'll see some of those dynamics play out. And then as Joe pointed out, there's -- the team has been doing a fantastic job. And some of the efforts and some of the collaboration that we've had with Jamie and his team on the operations side is resulting in wins and those start to layer in as we move through the year and into next year, and you'll start to see that in our business as well. Yes. I think in terms of numbers, we'll probably put a finer point on the truck conversion opportunity over the next three years at some time in the future. There's a huge focus by the team to really look at our pipeline and measure it and focus on those customers where there's an opportunity. And some customers have a lot more opportunities than others and making sure we have the resources up against those customers to really drive that conversion. So a lot of activity. We have a lot of new tools internally that we're focused on in terms of measuring that. So our data is getting better and better every day, and there's a lot of momentum. And as I mentioned, our pipeline, as we measure it on a year-over-year basis, is up significantly, up 30%. On a dollar volume perspective, it's up even more than that. So a lot of momentum building. Obviously, the trucking market is not the most receptive market to compete against right now. Hopefully, there's some optimism that's firming up here, and that will even drive more opportunities as we work with customers over the next few months to drive more opportunities. And we're upwards of 25 whiteboarding sessions year-to-date, and those are driving a lot of opportunities. They don't necessarily come to fruition tomorrow. But over the next couple of quarters, we think those are going to translate into a lot of opportunities to shift share from truck as well. So we're -- teams are very, very excited. I don't think we've had this much of momentum in terms of the things that we can control going forward. It's just some of these markets obviously are against us right now. Over to you, Sean. Yes. I think when you look at the second quarter, think about the international market being down in that high-teens range. We probably, from a bottom perspective, peak that down in that mid-20s, and it's improved slightly from there. So our exit rate is a little bit better than what we saw middle of the quarter. What we saw through the quarter on the domestic side is sequential improvement month-over-month or on a year-over-year basis each month as we get to move through the quarter. So that gives us optimism there. The team has done, quite frankly, a fantastic job of introducing some new lanes, working with some of our Class 1 partners to do that and identify new business. And some of those things are really playing out. Some of our partners have done really, really well in the market despite some of the, obviously, headwinds there. So working with them, identifying markets where we have some opportunities. And in these kind of markets, it gives you more flexibility to go out there and look at things, look at your network, identify opportunities, try things out that work -- may work and really go after it. So that's what the team has been using the softness in the market to go and do and set us up for growth as the market rebounds. And I think you're starting to see that in the numbers here. Yes. I probably won't put numbers around it, but there's a reason we're hiring. There's -- we see all the things that we can control internally, setting us up nicely for when the markets rebound. And yes, I think the combination of markets returning at least to -- in some cases, just the current demand levels is going to create a lot of leverage in our business to do that. And I think you'll see some of these businesses where we're having discussions around truck conversion as the market firms up, more willing to move that freight back over to rail or move it to rail for the first time. So it's -- the pipeline takes a while to build up. It's been -- as Joe was pointing out earlier, it's been about nine months since we've seen that rail improvement. And the customers are reacting to it, some sooner than others. But yeah, that's the idea of all these investments, obviously, will help us participate when that cyclical upside starts to occur. Yes. Obviously, putting coal aside, obviously, that we've talked about on the international side. When you look at yield broadly, there's always mix, right? And when you look at our merchandise business, in general, one of the markets we've highlighted is obviously under cyclical pressure right now is the chemical market, which typically has a higher RPU. So that's weighed on the overall benefit you've seen from the merchandise side, and there's a lot of moving parts within it. But if you look at what we were able to achieve within the individual markets is quite healthy I think despite some of the fuel surcharge headwinds that you saw. The intermodal market obviously is unique, given some of the challenges on the truck and what we have to do there, particularly on the spot market. But again, fuel surcharge is a much larger impact there. And absent that, you saw a flattish-type RPU, and that was mainly impacted by some of our longer-term contracts, obviously had positive rate. But on the flip side, some of the spot markets saw some significant downgrade along with the truck. But the market held in, obviously, a lot better than some of the trucking rates out there and what the markets do there. But overall, I was very pleased in some of the NPA results as we measure it or some of the highest results that we've seen in a long time, if you look broadly across the markets. Yes, I think that's fair. Obviously, there's bottoms, right, and there's -- we protect ourselves both on the bottom and then on the top end. We don't participate in some of the extreme stream cases, but I think that's fair. $225 is kind of embedded in what we're coming into the quarter. We've seen a little bit of positive uplift in that so even as recently as the last couple of days. So we'll see where that trends. But we've seen a lot of stability, if not a little slight uptick in that market here recently, and we'll see what the fourth quarter brings. I think the long-term trend, if you just go to Charleston, you go to Savannah and you look at all the investments being made, there's a long-term growth opportunity on the East Coast and you'll continue to see our growth in the East Coast, which we'll continue to serve and benefit from. Some stability on the West Coast is going to be helpful. As you know, a lot of our international business still comes across the West through Chicago and other interchange points. And unfortunately, a lot of that volume given some of the congestion on the West was either trucked, and we didn't see that volume. So as that -- we should benefit from a recovery there. So I don't see it as necessarily taking share away from what we're doing in the East, more as something that -- obviously, if the rails in the West begin to perform better on a year-over-year basis will benefit the Eastern network and some of that traffic coming to us. Look, I think the most important thing for a customer is reliability, right? And in some customers' eyes, they want to see more of that reliability. They like what they see today. We've got to continue to perform and have those conversations. And sometimes it's lane-by-lane. It's carload-by-carload where we get that confidence from a customer. And so we're in the very early innings of this, and we feel the acceleration from first quarter to second quarter, and I expect those conversations to pick up even more in the third and fourth quarters as we continue to perform. Sharing what we're doing on the hiring side is incredibly helpful. Sharing with them what we plan to do to make our network more resilient, winning their confidence, but that's the number one issue. It's not price. 99% of the time, we have a pricing advantage versus our truck competitor. So that's the opportunity for us. We have the environmental advantages. So we have all these things, we've just got to get the reliability and prove that the reliability is sustainable. Well, really hot summer certainly doesn't hurt and that's what we're in the middle of. Obviously, from a coal perspective and you're referencing mainly the domestic side, that's obviously dependent on the weather conditions and the weather I think is a surprise from a heat perspective to the upside here over the last few weeks. And we're seeing that with a lot of our customers running full out here and replenishing some of the inventory levels. And so we'll see how the winter plays out. I think it's really, really early in July to call 2024. That seems a bit premature to me. We see a very healthy export market as well. Obviously, that's driven by global macro conditions. But we have new supply coming online that will ramp up next year. That supply is going to land in the market. It's very competitive in the market, and we expect to participate in it. Many of the mines that we serve are going to be in the market almost no matter what conditions. So we see the volume there sustainable. On the ag side, again, I followed these markets for a long time. I think July is a little bit premature as well. It has been hot out there. We'll see how the market firms up here, but there's a lot of moving parts. We're seeing a little bit of weakness here in the third quarter, but we see some good indications into the fourth quarter. So we'll see how that trends, and we'll watch the crop conditions as you are to see how that moves into the back half of the year. Obviously, we don't have as large of a franchise on that side as some of the other railroads, particularly in the West from an export perspective. So a little less exposure. I don't -- I wouldn't read any of our comments that there's been any type of inflection down. We're just -- I don't think there's -- we're seeing in real-time an inflection up in the market. And I mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we obviously start to lap a lot easier comps on a year-over-year basis. So I think from a overall growth perspective, fourth quarter will be a much easier comp than what we've seen throughout the year. And hopefully, that momentum will carry into next year. But there's no indications that the market is necessarily picking up. I don't -- I think we bottomed from that perspective. The question is how quickly the market recovers. And that will be heavily relying on the consumer and how that pans out into the holiday season going forward."

            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the second quarter results, revenue was lower by 3% or $116 million, declines in fuel recovery, other revenue, and benchmark-based export coal pricing [Technical Difficulty] benefits from strong merchandise pricing, as well as volume growth across merchandise and export coal. Operating income was down 13% to $1.5 billion, reflecting a $122 million headwind from cycling a gain on the Virginia property transaction. I'll discuss the expense line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $25 million higher compared to the prior year, and income tax expense decreased by $64 million on lower pre-tax earnings. As a result, EPS fell by $0.05, reflecting a $0.04 impact of lower property gains. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total second quarter expense increased $105 million. Lower fuel price was largely offset by the prior year Virginia gain. While network efficiency improvements resulted in over $20 million of cost savings across labor, PS&O, and rents, it was not enough to overcome more than $100 million of headwinds from inflation and higher depreciation. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $57 million, impacted by inflation and increased headcount. Importantly, service improvements are helping us get more employees home sooner, with overtime ratios down nearly 10% and a significant reduction in the number of employees tuck away from home over 24 hours. As a reminder mid-year union wage rates stepped-up by 4% on July 1, and will be reflected in our second half cost per employee. PS&O expense increased $37 million with inflation and higher repair and maintenance expense, partly offset by savings in intermodal operations and cycling of costs related to the Pan Am acquisition. While we are overhauling and rebuilding more engines than last year, locomotive efficiency was 4% improved in the quarter. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study, as well as a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $134 million driven by lower gallon price. Equipment and rents was $5 million favorable, reflecting strong improvement in car cycle times with merchandise cycles 13% better than last year. These efficiency gains more than offset costs from inflation and higher volume, particularly in the automotive market. Finally, as discussed, property gains were $117 million unfavorable in the quarter. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on slide 17. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX has generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow year-to-date. This has supported $2.4 billion in shareholder returns, including over $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $450 million of dividends. We were encouraged to receive recent news of a credit ratings upgrade. This move reflects the strong core cash-generating power of CSX through economic cycles, which supports our ongoing commitment to investing in the business and our balanced opportunistic approach to capital return. Economic profit, as measured by CSX cash earnings, is up over $80 million year-to-date. While intermodal storage revenue declines in export coal headwinds we'll have a more significant year-over-year impact in the second-half, we remain committed to cultivating and investing in return-seeking projects that see the pipeline of mid and long-term growth and efficiency gains. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Thanks, Jon, for your question. Yes, your recollection is right in terms of what we said first quarter. So yes, we are building some momentum with $20 million, a little over $20 million of what I would call sort of fluidity-related savings year-over-year. Now just to be clear, we aren't really counting, sort of, changes in volume in that number up or down if there's costs related to that. This is sort of independent of that. This is things like cycling the cars faster and reducing costs related to that, reducing overtime, things along those lines. We do have line of sight to that number continuing to increase over the balance of the year, and we should be in that $30 million to $40 million range in the second-half of the year is our plan, especially as we get out of summer here and labor availability starts to pick up, we get some more employees out of training. We feel pretty good about what that's going to set us up for in the second half of the year. Scott, it's Sean. Yes, so in terms of Q3 versus Q2, I mean I think step back just a minute and think about what are we ultimately trying to achieve here. We've got a service product that's -- it's well in excess of where it's been and certainly one of the best, if not the best in the industry. That's ultimately going to translate into the ability to win business off the highway and we're seeing those. We're seeing a number of those opportunities present themselves. Over time, that's going to have a really positive impact not just on margins, but also on obviously being able to grow the top and bottom line of the company. When we look at the third quarter specifically relative to the second, we've got the headwinds that Kevin talked about on coal pricing. We've had positive fuel lag all year long. We're seeing fuel prices settle a little bit here so that could be a little bit of a headwind into the third quarter. And then as I mentioned, we've got the union wage rate increases of 4%. So that will add some costs. In terms of the second-half of your question, the gap between pricing and inflation. We're seeing mid-single-digit inflation across both labor and fringe and purchase services and other. That's going to persist here for the balance of the year. We've got a clean line of sight into the labor line. And most of the PS&O is essentially set for the year from a rate perspective. I would also say, and Kevin can chime in if there's additional info, but I think most of the pricing for the year has been done. We'll start to get into pricing for next year as we get towards the end of the year. And so far, conversations have been -- continue to be very supportive. Yes. And Ken, just on the second part of your question, I think the commentary you heard from Kevin suggests we're not calling a pullback in volumes. But to the extent that the macro presents something like that, there's things that we can do, there's levers that we can pull. And certainly, we would look to do that but not to jeopardize the ability to continue to gain momentum and gain share off of the truck, which is the ultimate goal here to kind of grow the pie and grow our profitability. Yeah. Thanks. And in terms of cost per employee, it should be fairly stable other than the 4% wage increase on the union piece. I think there are some opportunities to drive some efficiencies there. So we hope to do better than a 4% increase from the first-half to the second-half, but we'll certainly feel the impact of higher wages. And Amit, your question on PS&O, I'm always hesitant to predict that line, because there's a number of different puts and takes within it that can impact the quarter. I will say that we are very -- we're focused on cost control and we're making sure that we've got only the costs that are necessary in order to move the volume to the extent that intermodal volumes pick up a little bit, that will have an impact on PS&O costs. But outside of volume-related expenses, I would fully expect that we'd be able to, kind of, hold the line on the improvement that you saw in the second quarter in PS&O going forward. And if you look at it on a year-over-year basis for the second-half, that means we'll probably be able to absorb most of the inflationary impact in the second half, notwithstanding any sort of volume-related impacts that we might see."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to the First Quarter 2023 CSX Corporation's Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Jamie Boychuk, Executive Vice President of Operations; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find our forward-looking disclosure on Slide 2 followed by our non-GAAP disclosure on Slide 3.  And with that, it's my pleasure to introduce our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\nJoseph Hinrichs: All right. Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you all for joining our conference call. Working together, the ONE CSX team delivered a strong first quarter, driven by solid pricing as well as volume growth in our merchandise and coal businesses. With sufficient resources in place, we are able to use the benefits of our scaled railroad model to deliver improvement in our customer service performance that are driving real tangible financial results. Our network is running well, and we intend to do even better and show that CSX can sustain reliable service over time, which is essential for us to profitably grow our railroad. 2023 has already proven to be a very active year. One of our top priorities after the national union agreements were finalized last December was to address the matter of Paid sick leave for our union employees. I am very pleased that CSX demonstrated important leadership here. Starting in February, we were the first U.S. class [Technical Difficulty] more details about the specific proactive steps we have been taking to make CSX safer. I have also been actively involved in discussions with our leaders in Washington and the across states our network about some of the legislation that has recently been proposed. They know that it's better for our economy, our environment and our communities for railroads to move a greater share of the nation's freight. They also know that CSX is eager to be part of solutions that are effective, data-driven and will make our whole industry safer. We do not want safety performance to be a competitive advantage for CSX, but wanting to be something our entire industry is proud of. We have been encouraged by our conversations with senior policy leaders and we'll continue to engage with them in the months ahead, sharing best practices and building on our common ground.  We are confident that the industry will emerge in this period stronger, more aligned and better at sharing safety best practices. Now let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights of the first quarter. We moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generate over $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 9% higher than the previous year. Operating income increased 14% year-over-year to $1.46 billion, and our operating ratio was 60.5%, which includes the OR impact of the quality carrier destruction business, as we've discussed in the past.  Finally, earnings per share increased 23% to $0.48. When I came to CSX last fall, we were very clear with our intention to build on this company's excellent operating model by strengthening our relationships with our employees and serving our customers better. It is still early but you will hear clear examples of how we are starting to achieve this as Kevin, Jamie and Sean talk about the details, what was a very strong quarter.  Now let me turn it over to our team.\nJamie Boychuk: Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Every quarter, you hear us emphasize the importance of safety on our network. This is a fundamental part of our culture and defines how we execute our operating plan. We didn't take shortcuts, we don't compromise, and we teach this mindset to every 1 of our new hires and continually reemphasize it to all of our employees.  In this slide, you will see some of the real proactive steps that we are taking to keep our network running safely. In 2023, we are installing 53 additional hot box detectors across our network. These added detectors will reduce the average spacing from 16.2 miles to 14.9 miles. At CSX, these detectors identify high-bearing temperatures, but also transmit real-time data for trend analysis. So we can not only tell when a bearing is hot and a train needs to stop, but we can also use the data to predict bearings and issues before they reach critical temperatures. We're also continuing to integrate newly hired employees into our safety culture, which begins on day 1. Newly hired employees attend extensive training at our railroad Education and Development Institute in Atlanta.  The robust classroom, combined with field-based training gives these new employees the tools they need to operate safely in their new roles. Autonomous track assessment cars, commonly called ATACs, are also used as part of our proactive safety plan. These look and run like regular box cars that are loaded with advanced technology. These cars operate on our regular trains and gather critical inspection data that allow us to closely monitor track conditions. Lastly, we are committed to being supportive partners in the communities in which we live and operate.  That is why we dedicate so much effort to developing relationships with first responders in those communities and teaching them how to properly respond to incidents, especially those with hazmat materials. We have a dedicated fleet of railcars, including 4 tank cars that are specifically designed and used to offer multi-day training sessions. This is a program we have run for many years. And in 2022, we trained nearly 4,000 first responders. Turning to the next slide. The FRA personal injury rate ticked down sequentially, while the FRA train accident rate increased slightly. However, both measures are up year-over-year.  It's important to consider that because of the success of our recent hiring efforts, we have a higher percentage of newer employees -- as they gain experience and learn from federal railroaders, we are confident that the frequency of these incidents will decline. Now turning to Slide 9. Operating performance has improved significantly. With the appropriate resources in place, we are doing what we do best, effectively executing our operating plan. The team's ability to deliver these operating results is a true testament to the tough and hard work that we are doing as an operating team and a plan that shows no other than what we can do here at CSX.  Most importantly, the dedication that's given by all of our railroaders. I cannot thank our operating employees enough for overcoming the resource challenges and delivering such solid performance for our customers. Carload trip performance of 86% reached an all-time record level this quarter. while intermodal trip plan performance of 96% matched a record high, while the team is pleased with these results, we'll keep improving. In fact, both measures have continued to improve sequentially into the second quarter. I'm happy with the compliments and support we have received from customers regulators and shareholders on our service improvement, but we are not done yet. As Joe said, our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can sustain this over time so that we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss the top line results.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Jamie. We are very pleased with our merchandise performance this quarter. Revenue increased 13%, benefiting from an 8% increase in revenue per unit and a 4% increase in volume. We are seeing some encouraging signs as customers start to respond to our improved service and reduced cycle times. The team is focused on combining best-in-class service with creative solutions to identify new growth opportunities and gain wallet share with existing customers. While we did see positive growth in automotive, customer production issues impacted volumes in the quarter.  On the positive side, we see production issues moderating and expect a strong outlook for automotive volumes through the remainder of the year. Minerals and Metals both outperformed, driven largely by very strong aggregates in steel demand. Pricing was up year-over-year as we benefited from favorable contract repricing and higher fuel surcharge. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to see benefits from a supportive pricing environment and improved rail service. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we continue to see positive momentum in many of our merchandise segments as the team focuses on the growth drivers that we can control.  It's still early but we are encouraged by our ability to convert improved service into new business wins in segments such as auto, minerals and food products. There remains a significant opportunity to win share from truck across our merchandise portfolio. Turning to Slide 12. First quarter coal revenue increased 19% on 19% higher volume and flat revenue per unit. Export volumes were strong as we leverage improved cycle times and improved production and performance at the origin mines. We also benefited as we lap the effects of reduced capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal.  Our domestic shipments also improved on utility restocking demand and improved rail capacity. International met coal benchmarks remained strong over the quarter and now sits just below $300 per metric ton, which continues to support strong production levels. Looking ahead, the international coal market continues to be supported by healthy commodity prices that should drive positive year-over-year volume growth through the remainder of the year. While the domestic market could face a more challenging backdrop should natural gas prices remain low.  Turning to intermodal on Slide 13. First quarter revenue decreased by 5% as a 9% decrease in volume more than offset a 5% increase in revenue per unit. Most of this volume decline was due to weakness in international intermodal markets, which, as we expected, have been heavily affected by slowing import activity as demand softened and retail inventories remained elevated. Looking forward, while the intermodal market currently remains challenged, we do expect second half year-over-year headwinds to moderate. The team has a number of initiatives underway to continue to drive truck conversion by introducing new lanes of service where there is market demand.  Now finally, turning to Slide 14. Many of you are aware of the major market shift developing over the last few years as more companies look to diversify their supply chain and bring capacity closer to their key end markets. We have been encouraged by the acceleration in activity with manufacturers of all times, announcing plans and committing capital to build capacity in the Eastern U.S.  For CSX, this represents a great opportunity. Our network connects the major population centers of the Northeast with the fast-growing areas of the Southeast that are highly attractive for companies looking to expand. The mission of our industrial development team is to partner with these companies and provide them with a rail serve location where they can leverage the benefits of the CSX network and industry-leading service. We continue to invest in our select site program that has expanded to include a wider range of rail serve site opportunities.  Combined with new technology enhancements, this will allow us to capture industrial projects of all sizes by offering shovel-ready development sites with access to CSX network. As you can see on the slide, we are excited about the success we are seeing. In 2022 alone, our customer partners brought nearly 90 new facilities online, representing $8.2 billion of total investment across our network and on our short line partners. The map shows how broadly these in-service projects stretch across our service area. Our pipeline remains robust with over 500 projects in process across our entire industrial development pipeline, and we're adding to this total each month.  Over time, we expect the new business that these projects represent to be a key driver to our growth algorithm as we help our partners bring in an increasing number of expansion projects onto our network, driving volumes and revenue higher. I would like to thank the entire team for all of their efforts across our growth initiatives. We're very excited about the momentum we are building and the engagement as we partner with our customers to grow together. Now I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the first quarter results, revenue increased 9% or $300 million on merchandise and coal volume growth, strong pricing and higher fuel recovery. Operating income was up 14% to $1.5 billion as top line growth outpaced several expense headwinds, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slide. Interest and other expense was $7 million higher compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $47 million on higher pretax earnings. Net earnings increased 15% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 23%. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses.  Total first quarter expense increased $111 million compared to the prior year. This includes about $65 million of inflation headwinds as well as an $85 million impact from higher fuel and depreciation combined with lower real estate gains. Now turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $31 million as the impacts of additional head count and inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. PS&O expense increased $13 million primarily due to inflation, the inclusion of Pan Am operations and scheduled locomotive overhauls.  These impacts were partially offset by a $46 million benefit due to an insurance recovery arising from a customer facility outage several years ago as well as lower intermodal costs as congestion eases. There were also several smaller line item impacts within PS&O that were greater than expected this quarter and should improve sequentially. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study as well as a larger asset base. And fuel expense also increased by $33 million due to a higher gallon price and a 3% increase in gross ton miles.  Equipment and rents improved by $18 million, benefiting from increased fluidity and faster car higher days per load across all markets. Property gains were $19 million unfavorable in the quarter due primarily to lapping prior year gains from the Virginia real estate transaction. Network and congestion related savings were evident within rents and across intermodal terminal expenses this quarter, and we expect sustained network performance to drive further efficiency savings through the year.  Now turning to cash flow on Slide 18. CSX generated over $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter. reflecting the impact of cash payments for retroactive wages and bonuses paid to union employees. Adding back these payments, free cash flow would have been up slightly versus last year despite higher investments in the business. You'll also recall that CSX has introduced a measure of economic profit called CSX Cash earnings, or CCE, within our long-term incentive compensation. It benefits both our shareholders and the general public when we grow profitably by encouraging the conversion of freight off the highway.  And CCE is aligned with this shared interest by encouraging disciplined high-return capital investments. The calculation can be seen in the appendix. And through Q1, CCE is up $165 million versus the prior year. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter, including close to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our approach to returning excess cash to our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoseph Hinrichs: Thank you. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023, as shown on Slide 20. First, as you heard Kevin describe, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen year-to-date from our merchandise business. Strong demand for grains, metals, Minerals and Automotive, combined with significant new customer wins give us increasing confidence that we will be able to deliver solid volume growth for the year in merchandise. We're also off to a strong start to the year for coal, and we expect continued benefit from healthy export demand, both thermal and met. Our merchandise and coal have met or exceeded our expectations. Intermodal volumes have been below what we anticipated.  We knew the intermodal -- sorry, we knew the international intermodal activity will be down substantially over the first half of the year. And though parts of our domestic business are doing very well, has not been enough to offset the effect of lower imports and elevated inventory.  Altogether, Intermodal contributes less than 1/3 of our revenues, but it does contribute roughly half of our volume and was a drag on our total volume over the quarter. The softer intermodal performance will make it difficult for our total CSX volume to meet our previous guidance and grow faster than GDP, especially as consensus GDP estimates for 2023 have moved up and are currently at 1.1%. That said, the effect on our business mix is favorable. Revenue ton miles grew by a solid 4% in the first quarter, driven by the strength in merchandise and export coal and we expect revenue ton miles to grow solidly in the low single digits for the full year. The rest of our outlook is consistent with what we told you at the beginning of the year.  We continue to benefit from the favorable pricing environment with customer negotiations supported by our transparency on costs and our improved service products. We still expect supplemental revenues to decline by roughly $300 million compared to last year, with much of that decline in run rate already in [indiscernible] in the first quarter. International met coal benchmarks remained very strong over the quarter and spot prices are just below $300 per tonne today, but year-over-year comparisons will get tougher from here. We will continue our efforts to drive higher efficiency and reduce excess costs to counter the inflationary effects in our labor and other operating costs as best we can. So -- the best way for us to support our margin performance will be to drive more merchandise volume and benefit from the powerful operating leverage potential of our network.  Lastly, we still estimate cash flow expenditures at $2.3 billion. In closing, I am very encouraged by what we accomplished in this quarter. I'm energized to see the ONE CSX culture start to take shape across this company. Every industry has challenges, but ours are addressable and solvable, and I am confident that they are far outweighed by the opportunities that we have ahead. As I said before, all of us here at every location across our network share a common goal of providing the safe, reliable service to our customers that drives profitable growth, and we are taking meaningful steps towards that goal. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Joe. [Operator Instructions]. And with that, operator, please open up the line for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Kevin, with the backdrop of improving service and bidding compliance at pretty strong levels. Can you just talk about the order rates, the fill rates across the network? You've heard some different comments and clearly, intermodal is suffering from poor bid compliance. But where do you see when you talk to your customers across the different networks, I guess, primarily within merchandise, where it might be a little more service and truck sensitive.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think you probably remember the discussion over the last few quarters where we said we weren't up against the order rates. I would say we're probably more in line with that, especially with our improved service levels. So we're meeting the customer demand currently, but we did see weakness kind of starting last year during the third quarter, fourth quarter period. So as we look through the back half of the year, in many of our markets, particularly on the merchandise side, we see -- we should see some easier comparisons based on the current economic activity that we're seeing. So that's what gives us kind of the confidence in the guidance as we move through the year.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.\nKenneth Hoexter: Great. If I could just follow on that thought there, Kevin. So it seems like something changed economically kind of mid-February, right, if we look at spot rates in trucking. Can you talk about -- I don't know, Joe, you seem to be talking about kind of intermodal being tougher, and that's why switching from a GDP plus to a kind of an RTM type of outlook. Is there something changing economically in the backdrop more recently? Or is that just the weakness in the truck market? Maybe just talk a little bit about on the intermodal side or just the economic background.\nKevin Boone: Yes, I think -- and we certainly expected a weak market on the international side, but it's safe to say that I think that market came in a bit weaker than what we had expected in the first quarter. But on the flip side, and I would probably make this trade off every time as we saw some strength in some of the merchandise markets that obviously have a much higher ARPU and revenue contribution. So -- that's kind of what we saw through the quarter. There are varying opinions on when the international market will recover. Some of our larger customers expect some kind of pickup in the second half. We have seen some stability over the last 2 to 3 weeks, which is encouraging, but we'll face difficult comparisons through the third quarter and then fourth quarter gets a lot easier.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jon Chappell with Evercore ISI.\nJonathan Chappell: Kevin, I'm going to stick with you. Given the slides that Jamie put up, particularly number 9, with all those service improvements, Trip plan performance, et cetera, do you feel like you're being appropriately compensated for your improved service, both on an absolute basis, but especially on a relative basis as you go through these contract renewals. And I guess another way to ask that is, how far are you through the contract renewals that actually exemplify some of the service improvements that you've done over the last couple of months?\nKevin Boone: Yes. Typically, when you look at our renewal rates, and we renew a little over half our business every year, and that's highly concentrated in the fourth and first quarters. And I would say, given the backdrop in inflation that we would certainly we're having those conversations with our customers to be able to cover our cost increases that are very visible to the market. As we continue to prove our service, customers continue to reiterate, they're willing to pay for the service and the reliability that we can provide. And the plan is, and we -- I think that's starting to occur as we believe we have a differentiated service in the market.  And so it's -- we're starting to see early success in our conversations with customers around more volume opportunities with them. And I can't reiterate enough in a market like this is where we should be taking share. Our customers are looking for ways to save money. Usually, rail is a cheaper option for them, and they're getting more and more confidence in our ability to deliver the service that we need to. So the team is very, very excited about some of the things that we've been able to do here over the last few months.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: And maybe this is for Joe or Jamie, but we've had, obviously, a lot of negative press on the railroads, unfortunately, in the last few months. And the PSR concept has kind of been dragged through the mud a bit. But can you guys compare and contrast because you are delivering just like the last question, very good service metrics here. So what's driving the difference between the rest of the industry? And I guess, how do you leverage that going forward. .\nJoseph Hinrichs: Yes, thanks. I'll start and let Jamie add some comments. As I've said many times in the past, I think the guiding principles of our operating model are long-standing and are sustainable, and that, of course, improves safety control costs. Improve asset utilization, improve the employee experience and then also improve customer service, and we are working hard at all 5 of those and keeping them in balance as far as how we prioritize for always safety first.  And I believe very strongly that the results that we're seeing throughout our network and being delivered by our great ONE CSX team is a result of that and focusing on our employees and the customer service specifically. And so I believe that the principles of [indiscernible] railroading are just as valid today as they were 5 years ago. Obviously, it's how you keep things in balance and how you prioritize and how you bring everyone along and we're trying to lead by example in that regard.\nJamie Boychuk: Well, Joe hit it really well. For -- when I think about -- and I hear people say PSR, what does that really mean? I don't know. I only know one way to railroad. And this is the way I was taught the railroad many years ago back when I was at CN. So we've been able to teach the great folks at CSX over the past 6 years how to do this. I've got an unbelievable operating team, some great bench strength and we are doing fantastic, and we've got the resources in place in order to now actually operate the plan. We struggled for years to do that through COVID, but we've come out of it the way we said we would.  And we're operating the plant and the team that's out there that's exercising that in the field, not just the network folks who put the plan together, but the field team who is executing it and the folks on the [indiscernible] line who are running the trains each and every day that are doing an unbelievable job are getting the trains from point A to Z the way we need them to and servicing the customers the way that we've committed to servicing them and giving Kevin and his team a product that gives them an opportunity to finally go out there and sell something that's different. So I don't know, call it what you want. I just call it railroading.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: Kevin, how should we be thinking about rev per carload in sequentially even from 1Q, 2Q. Just maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes. And then similar things, Sean, just 60.5% OR in Q1. I know there's the insurance recovery, but do you think we see sequential improvement from here the rest of the year.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think really the biggest driver from Q1 to Q2, we continue to, as I said, see strong pricing in the backdrop of higher inflation and that's not going to -- that's going to continue throughout the year as we obviously have contract renewals, and we'll have those discussions with customers.  The biggest swing factor, quite frankly, is fuel surcharge and where you see diesel prices head into the summer here. And on a year-over-year basis, where they sit right now, obviously, that's an optical headwind, but we know how quickly those can recover, and so we'll see where that trends. But other than that, you look at export coal and sequentially, probably ex fuel, you're probably looking at something that's flat to the first quarter on the coal RPU, which can swing around a little bit, and that's one that you usually ask about. But otherwise, positive momentum on the core price and then we'll just have to wait and see where the diesel prices shake out.\nSean Pelkey: And then, Scott, in terms of operating ratio, yes, I mean, 60.5% for the first quarter is obviously a great start for us. I think as you think about sequentially, you probably have to normalize that for both the insurance gain and then the favorable fuel lag benefit that we had in the quarter. So that gets you to around a 62.5%. We almost always do better in the second quarter from an OR perspective than the first, and that's primarily as a result of the fact that volumes typically seasonally increase in Q2 relative to Q1. We don't see any reason to believe that we'll see anything different this year.  Particularly with some of the issues we had in Q1 with auto production that should ease here, have eased and a strong demand for aggregate. So it's a good setup. I will say just one thing to caveat that with is other revenue was a little bit elevated in Q1 versus the run rate where it likely will be the rest of the year, that may be a little bit of a headwind, but on the flip side, we feel good about the cost momentum if service continues to be at these levels or even better, we should see more costs come out sequentially.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Fadi Chamoun with BMO.\nFadi Chamoun: Yes. You had the slide talking about the 19 new facilities coming online and obviously, a very strong pipeline that you've discussed in the past into '24 and '25. But I'm just curious when you talk to existing customers, your existing facilities, are you seeing growth in your share of wallet? If you could give us some examples, some tangible example to kind of appreciate that.\nKevin Boone: Yes, Fadi. I think that's directly tied to our service product. And we're in the very early innings of that. I think we've seen some customers more willing to have those conversations and others that are kind of wait and see and want to see more months or even quarters of good performance before they're willing to have that conversation. But we've seen some early success. One example that comes to mind is in our food products category where we've gone from roughly a 60% share with our customer now 90% share and doing some things operationally, thanks to Jamie and his team have provided a really, really good service to them, truck-like service that really benefits them from a cost perspective. And that's a direct truck conversion for us. But I see many, many more of those examples starting to happen.  We're working really diligently with Jamie's team and having [indiscernible] exercises with our customers. which is really thinking through the art of what's possible, putting our network against what their needs are and really figuring out if there's opportunities to grow and how we really convert the truck. I think the customer acceptance on these meetings has been the highest I've ever seen because they're looking for ways to save on costs given the uncertain backdrop on the market. But a lot of momentum -- the team is working really hard. We have a number of these set up over the next few weeks and quarters ahead. And I expect to have a lot of success.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz with UBS.\nMichael Triano: This is Mike Triano on for Tom. So Trip plan compliance and carload 86 seems to be a level where you can make some good progress on truck conversions. Do you think that there are enough crew resources on the network to maintain a strong service product? Or is there some additional hiring that you have to do from here?\nJamie Boychuk: Mike, we've got a good number with respect to our people. We're still working on a -- like to get another 150 to 200 folks as we try to get closer to a 7,400 number, in particular, for vacation peak. We're sitting around 70% to 80%, I think, today, close to 73%. So we want to push towards that. Now remember, attrition is 10%. We've got to continue to stay up against attrition, which also gives us another trigger if something goes the other way, where we could react, as Sean mentioned, with some costs along the way if we needed to. Resource-wise, we definitely have enough locomotives out there. As a matter of fact, the faster we get the more fluid we get, we need less locomotives.  So we'll continue to analyze those resources and pull them out where we need to, but keep them in a spot where we can use them as Kevin and his team brings more business on we're able to bring them back. And of course, everything that comes back earns its keep. So we'll continue to work those resources. But on the car side, that's a strategy we continue to look at as a team. working with customers. I know Kevin and his team and my team are working close to make sure we've got car supply as we need them as we work with customers and make sure that we have the right resources on that end. At this point in time, we feel good with where we are.  But you see the growth that's coming, and Kevin talked about some of those growth areas that are out there. Maybe he wants to touch a little bit on the car side and what he sees in his discussions with customers in those resources. But other than that, -- we're in good shape with everything.\nKevin Boone: I think, as Jamie mentioned, Joe got the team together, the sales and marketing team, along with the operations team and Sean's team and we had a lengthy discussion here recently just on what the needs are. And I'm very encouraged of we have a plan to make sure that we can meet the coming demand in some of these markets that we see great growth and whether it's aggregates some of the auto business, where we know that car supply is going to be a differentiating factor where we feel like we have a good plan in place.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Justin Long with Stephens.\nJustin Long: Sean, I think on prior calls, you talked about the elevated level of service-related costs that should moderate this year. During the call in January, I felt like you were suggesting this tailwind would be more second half weighted. But could you share any updated thoughts on the cadence of these cost savings? I'm curious if you saw this materialize in the first quarter and how you're expecting that number to trend in the quarters ahead?\nSean Pelkey: Yes. I think we're off to a good start. Like I said, we had about $15 million to $20 million of what I would call congestion related cost savings in the quarter. That was mostly -- you see that clearly on the rents line on a within PS&O related to intermodal terminals. So we are already seeing some of those costs come out, as I mentioned, sequentially into Q2. Our forecast is that we'll see that pick up a little bit. And then as we get to the second half, that's where we'll see the bulk of it, like you mentioned.  So -- and that's going to be in -- continue to be improvements in things like rents and intermodal terminals, locomotive maintenance related to the engine count that Jamie talked about, over time and other related crew costs. So -- and then on top of that, we've got other initiatives not just related to cycling some of the congestion issues from last year that we're working on. And of course, volume growth always helps in terms of productivity levels, both our crews and our assets.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup.\nChristian Wetherbee: Maybe a question on the headcount side. Jamie, you gave some good near-term color. I guess I'm curious in the context of sort of your progress towards that 7,400 goal. And then reflecting the fact that the volume environment is maybe a little bit more questionable than it was earlier in the year. Is there a point where maybe you hit the pause button on hire and kind of reassess the volume environment? And so after the second quarter, we could see that number potentially moderate depending on the economic conditions we're seeing.\nJamie Boychuk: Chris. No, I'm -- listen, we -- I wouldn't say we took the pause button at all. What we've done is this time, I'd say, last quarter when we were talking, we had 550 trainees out there. We're looking to keep ourselves around 350 to 400 trainees as we move forward on a constant basis. So we dropped that number a bit knowing that we don't need to ramp up the way we were. As I said, we look at 10% as our attrition rate. So we still need to ramp up that number a little bit. And then, of course, we'll review a little bit if we need to bring that down to maybe 300 or maybe that 350 is the sweet spot.  We're always looking to reduce our attrition rate. I think in the industry for many, many years, 10% has been that rate. But of course, we're working really hard with our initiatives to see what we can do to get people to stay at the railroad. And if we see those numbers come down, then we'd be looking at our hiring needs obviously drop with that. But we're in a good spot. We're at a much better spot than where we were in the past with those numbers. I feel comfortable. And that's on the T&E side. Of course, we are still doing locomotive engineer training as we move forward.  It's the right thing for us to do, so we don't get ourselves in a situation where we're short on engineers in the future, but we recycle conductors to make engineers. And we're always hiring on our engineering side of the house and mechanical side as we continue to look at that high end on the union side. So our numbers are at a pretty good point. I don't see any large jumps at all. If anything, it's more just maintaining where we're at. And if we need to look at if things really go in a different direction. We know that we've got that 10% attrition rate. We've committed to our T&E folks that we're going to keep them [indiscernible] employed as long as we can through whatever we need to weather any storms. We don't necessarily see any storms ahead of us, but we don't know what the markets show obviously. But if we need to, we can pull that trigger on hiring really quick.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank.\nAmit Mehrotra: Congrats on the results really impressive. One question I wanted to ask. So if I look at intermodal revenue as a percentage of the total enterprise, it was like 13.5%, which I mean I could be wrong, but I think that's the lowest number at least this decade over the last 10 years. And so I guess I'm trying to understand, you showed good cost leverage the mix was really positive in terms of where that -- where the revenue growth came from. And so I guess I'm just trying to understand what happens to cost ex fuel as some of the intermodal mix normalize as a percentage of revenue. I don't know if you think that's a fair question or not, but it just seems like maybe that has something to do with some of the strong cost leverage.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. I mean, Amit, we don't get into sort of specific margins within each line of business. To the extent that intermodal volumes were down, which, of course, they were. You're going to see savings at intermodal terminals. We'll be able to see some savings on our crew starts. We'll have some savings on fuel -- but did that disproportionately impact our margins this year? And would that disproportionately impact them if intermodal or I should say, when intermodal recovers I don't think that's our view. We've got strong incremental margins within every segment of the business. And I think as intermodal -- as those volumes normalize and begin to grow again, it's going to have a positive impact on our operating ratio.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ari Rosa with Credit Suisse.\nAriel Rosa: Congrats on a strong quarter here. Kevin, you laid out a pretty exciting pipeline of new business opportunities there. I was hoping you could maybe quantify the impact of that in terms of revenue or earnings and kind of what the time line might look like for realizing whether it's that 500 set of opportunities that you talked about, what that might look like over the next couple of years.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean when you look at a number of these projects, it's going to take a couple of years, if not 3 years, to really complete some of the auto facilities that we're seeing, some of the -- on the metal side as well. So really, I think the momentum builds into 2025. aspirationally, if you ask me, it's kind of 1 to 2 points of growth that we would aspire to on a gross basis. Now sometimes some of these can cannibalize a little bit of your business, but I would like to be able to gross up a point, if not a little bit more, just from the industrial development side, given all the activity that we have as we really start to hit our stride and these projects come online.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Ben Nolan with Stifel.\nBenjamin Nolan: Actually, Kevin, I might follow up there because it is -- it's a nice list, nice map. I'm curious, as you look at that and you're competing for those projects. How much of that is competing against another rail versus actual head-to-head against trucks? Or how should we think about where the competition lies for that growth?\nKevin Boone: Well, as you know, over the last 40, 50 years, the railroads haven't done a great job of attracting new industrial development to the railroad. So it's all about getting the word out. It's all getting investing in our team, making sure that companies understand the advantages particularly some of these new markets, when you think about battery production that is very, very new to the United States, and they need to -- they're not familiar with necessarily rail infrastructure and what we can offer. So A lot of the exciting emerging markets, that's where you have to be out in front of it and make sure that you have -- you offer the locations, the infrastructure, the energy resources that they need in order to move quickly.  And it's all about having shovel-ready opportunities that touch the railroad, which you can develop quickly. And the market is moving way quicker than it ever has. And so that's why it's key to have these industrial sites ready for those customers to go. We compete every day with our eastern peer as well. And certainly, we're learning -- leaning into the service that we can provide. We touch a lot of other good industrial companies that they want to reach. And so those all things are factors in our selling points to the customers as they make these decisions.\nOperator: Take our next question from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Andre filling in for Jordan. I just wanted to sort of follow up on the fuel piece. It looks like fuel surcharge revenue was up $121 million year-over-year, but fuel expense was only up $33 million. So the net of the 2 is an $88 million benefit to EBIT in the first quarter. I think that benefit was more like $63 million in the fourth quarter. So some acceleration here on the fuel benefit. Any expectation for, I guess, how that trends in terms of timing or magnitude, It just -- or it seems like based on the diesel strips, you might see some benefit in the second quarter still and maybe drop in the third quarter. You just sort of curious in your thoughts here and what offsets there might be.\nSean Pelkey: Thanks, Andre. This is Sean. Your math is correct. I think if you look into the second quarter and you're looking on a sequential basis, at least where fuel prices are and where the forward curve is, it will be a net drag. I would put it in the category of $50 million plus versus the first quarter on a net basis. That's the impact to both revenue and expense. But I think what you were talking about is relative to last year, in the second quarter, it will be likely a net benefit just simply because last year in the second quarter, fuel prices were going up, and we reported a negative lag in the fuel surcharge program. So we'll be cycling that, assuming no change to diesel prices versus where they are right now.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from David Vernon with Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: Sean, can you talk a little bit about expectations for average cost per hedge kind of on a year-over-year basis and add any color to how much the CTO that's been added into the benefit packages is impacting cost for full year '23?\nSean Pelkey: Absolutely, David. So on cost per employee, I think we came in right about where we expected. Maybe a little bit favorable just due to mix impact of employees with the driver count at quality, which are a little less in terms of dollars per employee -- as you go to Q2, I think it will be fairly stable versus Q1, maybe up a little bit depending on that employee mix. And then as we get into the second half of the year, you will see a step-up just due to the timing of the wage increases for the union employees, which is scheduled to be a 4% increase -- in terms of the cost of the , which we've now got agreements with about 10,000 of our union employees -- we are -- we have added those costs into the forecast.  The experience so far has been very positive. We are seeing the employees take advantage of the benefit, and we are seeing when that's needed. There's a little bit of additional overtime, but there are some benefits to it as well and certainly quality of life is 1 of those benefits. And on a net basis, I would say, a couple of million a quarter at this point.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Allison Poliniak with Wells Fargo.\nAllison Poliniak: Just going back to the share gain piece of it. Merchandise volume, you grew 4%. Is there any way to quantify or give us some perspective of what those share gains were this quarter, if any? And as we think about that spread over what the market is growing in those areas, is that 1% to 2% on top of that a pretty good guide. And would that be more of '24 for this? Or do you think you can get there in '23?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think a lot of the success that we had in -- particularly on the merchandise side is really the service improvement that we saw. And our ability to capture the orders that our customers have. And so that January, February were really good months, weather probably was a little bit favorable in those months as well that then certainly help us, but then Jamie would tell me, March was pretty challenging from a weather perspective. So I would say overall, normal weather through the quarter, probably a little better in January, February. But it really is about just a service recovery and our ability on a year-over-year basis to capture more of the demand that was out there even though we've seen a little bit of softness in some markets.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital.\nWalter Spracklin: So I want to turn it back to Sean for a moment here. And really just related back to Jamie and Joe's comments. I mean -- and even Kevin. So Jamie has a pretty good handle on operations here. The model is working very well. Kevin is translating it into business wins and good growth opportunities. And then Joe in his outlook mentioned that asset productivity is going to exceed or approach prior record levels. when I go back and look at prior record levels, that's the time when you were hitting kind of the low 58 OR. Is that a good -- I mean is that overly simplistic to say that when you're hitting those kind of record operating record asset productivity levels that you can't achieve those type of ORs in 2023? Or is it a little too simplistic, Sean, to look at it that way?\nSean Pelkey: Well, Walter, I think you think back to the 58 OR, the first thing you've got to recognize is the quality acquisitions since then. So that's about 250 basis points of headwind. And we've had a lot of inflation. We're paying employees more. The underlying cost of contractors and materials is higher. And so those are headwinds. That being said, as we continue to run the business well and we deliver good productivity, and we get great feedback from the customers. We've got this pipeline of wins that are setting up as well as delivering against customer expectations and demands. We're going to deliver that at strong incremental margins, and that's going to help out over the medium to long term on the OR. I can't give you a specific point destination. But as we go forward, we would expect improvement from where we are right now.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jason Seidl with Cowen.\nJason Seidl: Congrats on the good quarter. It's really nice to see the service doing so well here, and that was reflected, I think, in our survey that we did this quarter. I wanted to talk about your outlook and sort of what's baked in with an assumption on the West Coast ports sort of coming to a labor agreement. Are you looking for some of that East Coast volumes to shift back? And if so, how do you think it will affect operations?\nKevin Boone: From that perspective, I don't see a huge amount of shift. You're going to continue to see you a secular advantage of the East Coast, and there's a lot of investment going on, as you know, in Savannah and other ports on the network. Quite frankly, the challenges on the West Coast have heard our intermodal business, when you think of what wants to come across through California through Chicago onto our network. So I view that as probably an incremental positive for us that some of that freight will see through the interchange with some of our Western partners out there. So that's a positive outcome in my mind in terms of our growth opportunity as we move into the back half.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and good afternoon, everyone. Every quarter, you hear us emphasize the importance of safety on our network. This is a fundamental part of our culture and defines how we execute our operating plan. We didn't take shortcuts, we don't compromise, and we teach this mindset to every 1 of our new hires and continually reemphasize it to all of our employees.  In this slide, you will see some of the real proactive steps that we are taking to keep our network running safely. In 2023, we are installing 53 additional hot box detectors across our network. These added detectors will reduce the average spacing from 16.2 miles to 14.9 miles. At CSX, these detectors identify high-bearing temperatures, but also transmit real-time data for trend analysis. So we can not only tell when a bearing is hot and a train needs to stop, but we can also use the data to predict bearings and issues before they reach critical temperatures. We're also continuing to integrate newly hired employees into our safety culture, which begins on day 1. Newly hired employees attend extensive training at our railroad Education and Development Institute in Atlanta.  The robust classroom, combined with field-based training gives these new employees the tools they need to operate safely in their new roles. Autonomous track assessment cars, commonly called ATACs, are also used as part of our proactive safety plan. These look and run like regular box cars that are loaded with advanced technology. These cars operate on our regular trains and gather critical inspection data that allow us to closely monitor track conditions. Lastly, we are committed to being supportive partners in the communities in which we live and operate.  That is why we dedicate so much effort to developing relationships with first responders in those communities and teaching them how to properly respond to incidents, especially those with hazmat materials. We have a dedicated fleet of railcars, including 4 tank cars that are specifically designed and used to offer multi-day training sessions. This is a program we have run for many years. And in 2022, we trained nearly 4,000 first responders. Turning to the next slide. The FRA personal injury rate ticked down sequentially, while the FRA train accident rate increased slightly. However, both measures are up year-over-year.  It's important to consider that because of the success of our recent hiring efforts, we have a higher percentage of newer employees -- as they gain experience and learn from federal railroaders, we are confident that the frequency of these incidents will decline. Now turning to Slide 9. Operating performance has improved significantly. With the appropriate resources in place, we are doing what we do best, effectively executing our operating plan. The team's ability to deliver these operating results is a true testament to the tough and hard work that we are doing as an operating team and a plan that shows no other than what we can do here at CSX.  Most importantly, the dedication that's given by all of our railroaders. I cannot thank our operating employees enough for overcoming the resource challenges and delivering such solid performance for our customers. Carload trip performance of 86% reached an all-time record level this quarter. while intermodal trip plan performance of 96% matched a record high, while the team is pleased with these results, we'll keep improving. In fact, both measures have continued to improve sequentially into the second quarter. I'm happy with the compliments and support we have received from customers regulators and shareholders on our service improvement, but we are not done yet. As Joe said, our goal is to keep improving our service and show that we can sustain this over time so that we can drive long-term growth for CSX. With that, I will turn it over to Kevin to discuss the top line results. Well, Joe hit it really well. For -- when I think about -- and I hear people say PSR, what does that really mean? I don't know. I only know one way to railroad. And this is the way I was taught the railroad many years ago back when I was at CN. So we've been able to teach the great folks at CSX over the past 6 years how to do this. I've got an unbelievable operating team, some great bench strength and we are doing fantastic, and we've got the resources in place in order to now actually operate the plan. We struggled for years to do that through COVID, but we've come out of it the way we said we would.  And we're operating the plant and the team that's out there that's exercising that in the field, not just the network folks who put the plan together, but the field team who is executing it and the folks on the [indiscernible] line who are running the trains each and every day that are doing an unbelievable job are getting the trains from point A to Z the way we need them to and servicing the customers the way that we've committed to servicing them and giving Kevin and his team a product that gives them an opportunity to finally go out there and sell something that's different. So I don't know, call it what you want. I just call it railroading. Mike, we've got a good number with respect to our people. We're still working on a -- like to get another 150 to 200 folks as we try to get closer to a 7,400 number, in particular, for vacation peak. We're sitting around 70% to 80%, I think, today, close to 73%. So we want to push towards that. Now remember, attrition is 10%. We've got to continue to stay up against attrition, which also gives us another trigger if something goes the other way, where we could react, as Sean mentioned, with some costs along the way if we needed to. Resource-wise, we definitely have enough locomotives out there. As a matter of fact, the faster we get the more fluid we get, we need less locomotives.  So we'll continue to analyze those resources and pull them out where we need to, but keep them in a spot where we can use them as Kevin and his team brings more business on we're able to bring them back. And of course, everything that comes back earns its keep. So we'll continue to work those resources. But on the car side, that's a strategy we continue to look at as a team. working with customers. I know Kevin and his team and my team are working close to make sure we've got car supply as we need them as we work with customers and make sure that we have the right resources on that end. At this point in time, we feel good with where we are.  But you see the growth that's coming, and Kevin talked about some of those growth areas that are out there. Maybe he wants to touch a little bit on the car side and what he sees in his discussions with customers in those resources. But other than that, -- we're in good shape with everything. Chris. No, I'm -- listen, we -- I wouldn't say we took the pause button at all. What we've done is this time, I'd say, last quarter when we were talking, we had 550 trainees out there. We're looking to keep ourselves around 350 to 400 trainees as we move forward on a constant basis. So we dropped that number a bit knowing that we don't need to ramp up the way we were. As I said, we look at 10% as our attrition rate. So we still need to ramp up that number a little bit. And then, of course, we'll review a little bit if we need to bring that down to maybe 300 or maybe that 350 is the sweet spot.  We're always looking to reduce our attrition rate. I think in the industry for many, many years, 10% has been that rate. But of course, we're working really hard with our initiatives to see what we can do to get people to stay at the railroad. And if we see those numbers come down, then we'd be looking at our hiring needs obviously drop with that. But we're in a good spot. We're at a much better spot than where we were in the past with those numbers. I feel comfortable. And that's on the T&E side. Of course, we are still doing locomotive engineer training as we move forward.  It's the right thing for us to do, so we don't get ourselves in a situation where we're short on engineers in the future, but we recycle conductors to make engineers. And we're always hiring on our engineering side of the house and mechanical side as we continue to look at that high end on the union side. So our numbers are at a pretty good point. I don't see any large jumps at all. If anything, it's more just maintaining where we're at. And if we need to look at if things really go in a different direction. We know that we've got that 10% attrition rate. We've committed to our T&E folks that we're going to keep them [indiscernible] employed as long as we can through whatever we need to weather any storms. We don't necessarily see any storms ahead of us, but we don't know what the markets show obviously. But if we need to, we can pull that trigger on hiring really quick."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you, Jamie. We are very pleased with our merchandise performance this quarter. Revenue increased 13%, benefiting from an 8% increase in revenue per unit and a 4% increase in volume. We are seeing some encouraging signs as customers start to respond to our improved service and reduced cycle times. The team is focused on combining best-in-class service with creative solutions to identify new growth opportunities and gain wallet share with existing customers. While we did see positive growth in automotive, customer production issues impacted volumes in the quarter.  On the positive side, we see production issues moderating and expect a strong outlook for automotive volumes through the remainder of the year. Minerals and Metals both outperformed, driven largely by very strong aggregates in steel demand. Pricing was up year-over-year as we benefited from favorable contract repricing and higher fuel surcharge. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to see benefits from a supportive pricing environment and improved rail service. While the economic outlook remains uncertain, we continue to see positive momentum in many of our merchandise segments as the team focuses on the growth drivers that we can control.  It's still early but we are encouraged by our ability to convert improved service into new business wins in segments such as auto, minerals and food products. There remains a significant opportunity to win share from truck across our merchandise portfolio. Turning to Slide 12. First quarter coal revenue increased 19% on 19% higher volume and flat revenue per unit. Export volumes were strong as we leverage improved cycle times and improved production and performance at the origin mines. We also benefited as we lap the effects of reduced capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal.  Our domestic shipments also improved on utility restocking demand and improved rail capacity. International met coal benchmarks remained strong over the quarter and now sits just below $300 per metric ton, which continues to support strong production levels. Looking ahead, the international coal market continues to be supported by healthy commodity prices that should drive positive year-over-year volume growth through the remainder of the year. While the domestic market could face a more challenging backdrop should natural gas prices remain low.  Turning to intermodal on Slide 13. First quarter revenue decreased by 5% as a 9% decrease in volume more than offset a 5% increase in revenue per unit. Most of this volume decline was due to weakness in international intermodal markets, which, as we expected, have been heavily affected by slowing import activity as demand softened and retail inventories remained elevated. Looking forward, while the intermodal market currently remains challenged, we do expect second half year-over-year headwinds to moderate. The team has a number of initiatives underway to continue to drive truck conversion by introducing new lanes of service where there is market demand.  Now finally, turning to Slide 14. Many of you are aware of the major market shift developing over the last few years as more companies look to diversify their supply chain and bring capacity closer to their key end markets. We have been encouraged by the acceleration in activity with manufacturers of all times, announcing plans and committing capital to build capacity in the Eastern U.S.  For CSX, this represents a great opportunity. Our network connects the major population centers of the Northeast with the fast-growing areas of the Southeast that are highly attractive for companies looking to expand. The mission of our industrial development team is to partner with these companies and provide them with a rail serve location where they can leverage the benefits of the CSX network and industry-leading service. We continue to invest in our select site program that has expanded to include a wider range of rail serve site opportunities.  Combined with new technology enhancements, this will allow us to capture industrial projects of all sizes by offering shovel-ready development sites with access to CSX network. As you can see on the slide, we are excited about the success we are seeing. In 2022 alone, our customer partners brought nearly 90 new facilities online, representing $8.2 billion of total investment across our network and on our short line partners. The map shows how broadly these in-service projects stretch across our service area. Our pipeline remains robust with over 500 projects in process across our entire industrial development pipeline, and we're adding to this total each month.  Over time, we expect the new business that these projects represent to be a key driver to our growth algorithm as we help our partners bring in an increasing number of expansion projects onto our network, driving volumes and revenue higher. I would like to thank the entire team for all of their efforts across our growth initiatives. We're very excited about the momentum we are building and the engagement as we partner with our customers to grow together. Now I'll turn it over to Sean to discuss the financials. Yes. I think you probably remember the discussion over the last few quarters where we said we weren't up against the order rates. I would say we're probably more in line with that, especially with our improved service levels. So we're meeting the customer demand currently, but we did see weakness kind of starting last year during the third quarter, fourth quarter period. So as we look through the back half of the year, in many of our markets, particularly on the merchandise side, we see -- we should see some easier comparisons based on the current economic activity that we're seeing. So that's what gives us kind of the confidence in the guidance as we move through the year. Yes, I think -- and we certainly expected a weak market on the international side, but it's safe to say that I think that market came in a bit weaker than what we had expected in the first quarter. But on the flip side, and I would probably make this trade off every time as we saw some strength in some of the merchandise markets that obviously have a much higher ARPU and revenue contribution. So -- that's kind of what we saw through the quarter. There are varying opinions on when the international market will recover. Some of our larger customers expect some kind of pickup in the second half. We have seen some stability over the last 2 to 3 weeks, which is encouraging, but we'll face difficult comparisons through the third quarter and then fourth quarter gets a lot easier. Yes. Typically, when you look at our renewal rates, and we renew a little over half our business every year, and that's highly concentrated in the fourth and first quarters. And I would say, given the backdrop in inflation that we would certainly we're having those conversations with our customers to be able to cover our cost increases that are very visible to the market. As we continue to prove our service, customers continue to reiterate, they're willing to pay for the service and the reliability that we can provide. And the plan is, and we -- I think that's starting to occur as we believe we have a differentiated service in the market.  And so it's -- we're starting to see early success in our conversations with customers around more volume opportunities with them. And I can't reiterate enough in a market like this is where we should be taking share. Our customers are looking for ways to save money. Usually, rail is a cheaper option for them, and they're getting more and more confidence in our ability to deliver the service that we need to. So the team is very, very excited about some of the things that we've been able to do here over the last few months. Yes. I think really the biggest driver from Q1 to Q2, we continue to, as I said, see strong pricing in the backdrop of higher inflation and that's not going to -- that's going to continue throughout the year as we obviously have contract renewals, and we'll have those discussions with customers.  The biggest swing factor, quite frankly, is fuel surcharge and where you see diesel prices head into the summer here. And on a year-over-year basis, where they sit right now, obviously, that's an optical headwind, but we know how quickly those can recover, and so we'll see where that trends. But other than that, you look at export coal and sequentially, probably ex fuel, you're probably looking at something that's flat to the first quarter on the coal RPU, which can swing around a little bit, and that's one that you usually ask about. But otherwise, positive momentum on the core price and then we'll just have to wait and see where the diesel prices shake out. Yes, Fadi. I think that's directly tied to our service product. And we're in the very early innings of that. I think we've seen some customers more willing to have those conversations and others that are kind of wait and see and want to see more months or even quarters of good performance before they're willing to have that conversation. But we've seen some early success. One example that comes to mind is in our food products category where we've gone from roughly a 60% share with our customer now 90% share and doing some things operationally, thanks to Jamie and his team have provided a really, really good service to them, truck-like service that really benefits them from a cost perspective. And that's a direct truck conversion for us. But I see many, many more of those examples starting to happen.  We're working really diligently with Jamie's team and having [indiscernible] exercises with our customers. which is really thinking through the art of what's possible, putting our network against what their needs are and really figuring out if there's opportunities to grow and how we really convert the truck. I think the customer acceptance on these meetings has been the highest I've ever seen because they're looking for ways to save on costs given the uncertain backdrop on the market. But a lot of momentum -- the team is working really hard. We have a number of these set up over the next few weeks and quarters ahead. And I expect to have a lot of success. I think, as Jamie mentioned, Joe got the team together, the sales and marketing team, along with the operations team and Sean's team and we had a lengthy discussion here recently just on what the needs are. And I'm very encouraged of we have a plan to make sure that we can meet the coming demand in some of these markets that we see great growth and whether it's aggregates some of the auto business, where we know that car supply is going to be a differentiating factor where we feel like we have a good plan in place. Yes. I mean when you look at a number of these projects, it's going to take a couple of years, if not 3 years, to really complete some of the auto facilities that we're seeing, some of the -- on the metal side as well. So really, I think the momentum builds into 2025. aspirationally, if you ask me, it's kind of 1 to 2 points of growth that we would aspire to on a gross basis. Now sometimes some of these can cannibalize a little bit of your business, but I would like to be able to gross up a point, if not a little bit more, just from the industrial development side, given all the activity that we have as we really start to hit our stride and these projects come online. Well, as you know, over the last 40, 50 years, the railroads haven't done a great job of attracting new industrial development to the railroad. So it's all about getting the word out. It's all getting investing in our team, making sure that companies understand the advantages particularly some of these new markets, when you think about battery production that is very, very new to the United States, and they need to -- they're not familiar with necessarily rail infrastructure and what we can offer. So A lot of the exciting emerging markets, that's where you have to be out in front of it and make sure that you have -- you offer the locations, the infrastructure, the energy resources that they need in order to move quickly.  And it's all about having shovel-ready opportunities that touch the railroad, which you can develop quickly. And the market is moving way quicker than it ever has. And so that's why it's key to have these industrial sites ready for those customers to go. We compete every day with our eastern peer as well. And certainly, we're learning -- leaning into the service that we can provide. We touch a lot of other good industrial companies that they want to reach. And so those all things are factors in our selling points to the customers as they make these decisions. Yes. I think a lot of the success that we had in -- particularly on the merchandise side is really the service improvement that we saw. And our ability to capture the orders that our customers have. And so that January, February were really good months, weather probably was a little bit favorable in those months as well that then certainly help us, but then Jamie would tell me, March was pretty challenging from a weather perspective. So I would say overall, normal weather through the quarter, probably a little better in January, February. But it really is about just a service recovery and our ability on a year-over-year basis to capture more of the demand that was out there even though we've seen a little bit of softness in some markets. From that perspective, I don't see a huge amount of shift. You're going to continue to see you a secular advantage of the East Coast, and there's a lot of investment going on, as you know, in Savannah and other ports on the network. Quite frankly, the challenges on the West Coast have heard our intermodal business, when you think of what wants to come across through California through Chicago onto our network. So I view that as probably an incremental positive for us that some of that freight will see through the interchange with some of our Western partners out there. So that's a positive outcome in my mind in terms of our growth opportunity as we move into the back half."

            "content": "All right. Good evening, everyone. Thank you, Matthew, and thank you all for joining our conference call. Working together, the ONE CSX team delivered a strong first quarter, driven by solid pricing as well as volume growth in our merchandise and coal businesses. With sufficient resources in place, we are able to use the benefits of our scaled railroad model to deliver improvement in our customer service performance that are driving real tangible financial results. Our network is running well, and we intend to do even better and show that CSX can sustain reliable service over time, which is essential for us to profitably grow our railroad. 2023 has already proven to be a very active year. One of our top priorities after the national union agreements were finalized last December was to address the matter of Paid sick leave for our union employees. I am very pleased that CSX demonstrated important leadership here. Starting in February, we were the first U.S. class [Technical Difficulty] more details about the specific proactive steps we have been taking to make CSX safer. I have also been actively involved in discussions with our leaders in Washington and the across states our network about some of the legislation that has recently been proposed. They know that it's better for our economy, our environment and our communities for railroads to move a greater share of the nation's freight. They also know that CSX is eager to be part of solutions that are effective, data-driven and will make our whole industry safer. We do not want safety performance to be a competitive advantage for CSX, but wanting to be something our entire industry is proud of. We have been encouraged by our conversations with senior policy leaders and we'll continue to engage with them in the months ahead, sharing best practices and building on our common ground.  We are confident that the industry will emerge in this period stronger, more aligned and better at sharing safety best practices. Now let's turn to our presentation to review the highlights of the first quarter. We moved nearly 1.5 million carloads in the first quarter and generate over $3.7 billion in revenue, which was 9% higher than the previous year. Operating income increased 14% year-over-year to $1.46 billion, and our operating ratio was 60.5%, which includes the OR impact of the quality carrier destruction business, as we've discussed in the past.  Finally, earnings per share increased 23% to $0.48. When I came to CSX last fall, we were very clear with our intention to build on this company's excellent operating model by strengthening our relationships with our employees and serving our customers better. It is still early but you will hear clear examples of how we are starting to achieve this as Kevin, Jamie and Sean talk about the details, what was a very strong quarter.  Now let me turn it over to our team. Thank you. Thank you, Sean. Now let's conclude with some comments on our outlook for 2023, as shown on Slide 20. First, as you heard Kevin describe, we are very pleased with the performance we have seen year-to-date from our merchandise business. Strong demand for grains, metals, Minerals and Automotive, combined with significant new customer wins give us increasing confidence that we will be able to deliver solid volume growth for the year in merchandise. We're also off to a strong start to the year for coal, and we expect continued benefit from healthy export demand, both thermal and met. Our merchandise and coal have met or exceeded our expectations. Intermodal volumes have been below what we anticipated.  We knew the intermodal -- sorry, we knew the international intermodal activity will be down substantially over the first half of the year. And though parts of our domestic business are doing very well, has not been enough to offset the effect of lower imports and elevated inventory.  Altogether, Intermodal contributes less than 1/3 of our revenues, but it does contribute roughly half of our volume and was a drag on our total volume over the quarter. The softer intermodal performance will make it difficult for our total CSX volume to meet our previous guidance and grow faster than GDP, especially as consensus GDP estimates for 2023 have moved up and are currently at 1.1%. That said, the effect on our business mix is favorable. Revenue ton miles grew by a solid 4% in the first quarter, driven by the strength in merchandise and export coal and we expect revenue ton miles to grow solidly in the low single digits for the full year. The rest of our outlook is consistent with what we told you at the beginning of the year.  We continue to benefit from the favorable pricing environment with customer negotiations supported by our transparency on costs and our improved service products. We still expect supplemental revenues to decline by roughly $300 million compared to last year, with much of that decline in run rate already in [indiscernible] in the first quarter. International met coal benchmarks remained very strong over the quarter and spot prices are just below $300 per tonne today, but year-over-year comparisons will get tougher from here. We will continue our efforts to drive higher efficiency and reduce excess costs to counter the inflationary effects in our labor and other operating costs as best we can. So -- the best way for us to support our margin performance will be to drive more merchandise volume and benefit from the powerful operating leverage potential of our network.  Lastly, we still estimate cash flow expenditures at $2.3 billion. In closing, I am very encouraged by what we accomplished in this quarter. I'm energized to see the ONE CSX culture start to take shape across this company. Every industry has challenges, but ours are addressable and solvable, and I am confident that they are far outweighed by the opportunities that we have ahead. As I said before, all of us here at every location across our network share a common goal of providing the safe, reliable service to our customers that drives profitable growth, and we are taking meaningful steps towards that goal. Thank you, and we'll now take your questions. Yes, thanks. I'll start and let Jamie add some comments. As I've said many times in the past, I think the guiding principles of our operating model are long-standing and are sustainable, and that, of course, improves safety control costs. Improve asset utilization, improve the employee experience and then also improve customer service, and we are working hard at all 5 of those and keeping them in balance as far as how we prioritize for always safety first.  And I believe very strongly that the results that we're seeing throughout our network and being delivered by our great ONE CSX team is a result of that and focusing on our employees and the customer service specifically. And so I believe that the principles of [indiscernible] railroading are just as valid today as they were 5 years ago. Obviously, it's how you keep things in balance and how you prioritize and how you bring everyone along and we're trying to lead by example in that regard."

            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. Looking at the first quarter results, revenue increased 9% or $300 million on merchandise and coal volume growth, strong pricing and higher fuel recovery. Operating income was up 14% to $1.5 billion as top line growth outpaced several expense headwinds, which I'll discuss in more detail on the following slide. Interest and other expense was $7 million higher compared to the prior year and income tax expense increased by $47 million on higher pretax earnings. Net earnings increased 15% to $1 billion, while EPS grew 23%. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses.  Total first quarter expense increased $111 million compared to the prior year. This includes about $65 million of inflation headwinds as well as an $85 million impact from higher fuel and depreciation combined with lower real estate gains. Now turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe expense increased $31 million as the impacts of additional head count and inflation were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense. PS&O expense increased $13 million primarily due to inflation, the inclusion of Pan Am operations and scheduled locomotive overhauls.  These impacts were partially offset by a $46 million benefit due to an insurance recovery arising from a customer facility outage several years ago as well as lower intermodal costs as congestion eases. There were also several smaller line item impacts within PS&O that were greater than expected this quarter and should improve sequentially. Depreciation was up $33 million as a result of last year's equipment study as well as a larger asset base. And fuel expense also increased by $33 million due to a higher gallon price and a 3% increase in gross ton miles.  Equipment and rents improved by $18 million, benefiting from increased fluidity and faster car higher days per load across all markets. Property gains were $19 million unfavorable in the quarter due primarily to lapping prior year gains from the Virginia real estate transaction. Network and congestion related savings were evident within rents and across intermodal terminal expenses this quarter, and we expect sustained network performance to drive further efficiency savings through the year.  Now turning to cash flow on Slide 18. CSX generated over $800 million of free cash flow in the quarter. reflecting the impact of cash payments for retroactive wages and bonuses paid to union employees. Adding back these payments, free cash flow would have been up slightly versus last year despite higher investments in the business. You'll also recall that CSX has introduced a measure of economic profit called CSX Cash earnings, or CCE, within our long-term incentive compensation. It benefits both our shareholders and the general public when we grow profitably by encouraging the conversion of freight off the highway.  And CCE is aligned with this shared interest by encouraging disciplined high-return capital investments. The calculation can be seen in the appendix. And through Q1, CCE is up $165 million versus the prior year. After fully funding infrastructure investments and strategic projects, CSX returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the first quarter, including close to $1.1 billion of share repurchases and over $200 million in dividends. Looking forward, we will remain balanced and opportunistic in our approach to returning excess cash to our shareholders. And with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. And then, Scott, in terms of operating ratio, yes, I mean, 60.5% for the first quarter is obviously a great start for us. I think as you think about sequentially, you probably have to normalize that for both the insurance gain and then the favorable fuel lag benefit that we had in the quarter. So that gets you to around a 62.5%. We almost always do better in the second quarter from an OR perspective than the first, and that's primarily as a result of the fact that volumes typically seasonally increase in Q2 relative to Q1. We don't see any reason to believe that we'll see anything different this year.  Particularly with some of the issues we had in Q1 with auto production that should ease here, have eased and a strong demand for aggregate. So it's a good setup. I will say just one thing to caveat that with is other revenue was a little bit elevated in Q1 versus the run rate where it likely will be the rest of the year, that may be a little bit of a headwind, but on the flip side, we feel good about the cost momentum if service continues to be at these levels or even better, we should see more costs come out sequentially. Yes. I think we're off to a good start. Like I said, we had about $15 million to $20 million of what I would call congestion related cost savings in the quarter. That was mostly -- you see that clearly on the rents line on a within PS&O related to intermodal terminals. So we are already seeing some of those costs come out, as I mentioned, sequentially into Q2. Our forecast is that we'll see that pick up a little bit. And then as we get to the second half, that's where we'll see the bulk of it, like you mentioned.  So -- and that's going to be in -- continue to be improvements in things like rents and intermodal terminals, locomotive maintenance related to the engine count that Jamie talked about, over time and other related crew costs. So -- and then on top of that, we've got other initiatives not just related to cycling some of the congestion issues from last year that we're working on. And of course, volume growth always helps in terms of productivity levels, both our crews and our assets. Yes. I mean, Amit, we don't get into sort of specific margins within each line of business. To the extent that intermodal volumes were down, which, of course, they were. You're going to see savings at intermodal terminals. We'll be able to see some savings on our crew starts. We'll have some savings on fuel -- but did that disproportionately impact our margins this year? And would that disproportionately impact them if intermodal or I should say, when intermodal recovers I don't think that's our view. We've got strong incremental margins within every segment of the business. And I think as intermodal -- as those volumes normalize and begin to grow again, it's going to have a positive impact on our operating ratio. Thanks, Andre. This is Sean. Your math is correct. I think if you look into the second quarter and you're looking on a sequential basis, at least where fuel prices are and where the forward curve is, it will be a net drag. I would put it in the category of $50 million plus versus the first quarter on a net basis. That's the impact to both revenue and expense. But I think what you were talking about is relative to last year, in the second quarter, it will be likely a net benefit just simply because last year in the second quarter, fuel prices were going up, and we reported a negative lag in the fuel surcharge program. So we'll be cycling that, assuming no change to diesel prices versus where they are right now. Absolutely, David. So on cost per employee, I think we came in right about where we expected. Maybe a little bit favorable just due to mix impact of employees with the driver count at quality, which are a little less in terms of dollars per employee -- as you go to Q2, I think it will be fairly stable versus Q1, maybe up a little bit depending on that employee mix. And then as we get into the second half of the year, you will see a step-up just due to the timing of the wage increases for the union employees, which is scheduled to be a 4% increase -- in terms of the cost of the , which we've now got agreements with about 10,000 of our union employees -- we are -- we have added those costs into the forecast.  The experience so far has been very positive. We are seeing the employees take advantage of the benefit, and we are seeing when that's needed. There's a little bit of additional overtime, but there are some benefits to it as well and certainly quality of life is 1 of those benefits. And on a net basis, I would say, a couple of million a quarter at this point. Well, Walter, I think you think back to the 58 OR, the first thing you've got to recognize is the quality acquisitions since then. So that's about 250 basis points of headwind. And we've had a lot of inflation. We're paying employees more. The underlying cost of contractors and materials is higher. And so those are headwinds. That being said, as we continue to run the business well and we deliver good productivity, and we get great feedback from the customers. We've got this pipeline of wins that are setting up as well as delivering against customer expectations and demands. We're going to deliver that at strong incremental margins, and that's going to help out over the medium to long term on the OR. I can't give you a specific point destination. But as we go forward, we would expect improvement from where we are right now."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, operator. Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Welcome to our third quarter earnings call. Joining me on this call are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call and available on our website, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. With that, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter call today. First, I want to thank our entire ONE CSX team who've been tireless in helping our employees and their communities recover from the hardships caused by two hurricanes in a matter of weeks. Helene, in particular, had a big impact on our network, and we'll talk more about that today. We have largely recovered, and we have made sure that CSX has been able to support our railroaders who have needed the systems for themselves and their families. That said, there's more work that we will need to do to repair and replace some of the physical infrastructure that we lost, which Mike and Sean will discuss later on this call. Now stepping back and looking at this entire quarter, I am proud of what we accomplished. Our aim was to grow volume, revenue and operating margin compared to last year, and that is exactly what we delivered. Our merchandise franchise continues to grow at an impressive pace, benefiting from our service leadership and the numerous initiatives that Kevin and his team are pursuing to bring new business to CSX. Operationally, our efficiency and cost controls remain solid we're still only getting started with some of the ways that we are using valuable, real-time data to optimize our network. We have had our challenges. This quarter, we had to adapt and respond to significant weather events, equipment issues at our coal terminal and lower diesel prices. Throughout, we've kept our focus on our long-term goals to deliver consistent, sustainable, profitable growth over time. Now let's go over some of the highlights. On Slide 1, it shows our key results from our third quarter compared to last year. Despite the severe weather, we were still able to publish some very good results across the Company. Looking across the highlights listed on this top line. Total volume grew by 3% versus last year, where by strong performance in our core merchandise business where volume also grew by 3%. Merchandise revenue grew by impressive 6%, supported by 3% growth in volume and favorable pricing. Our operating margin reached 37.4%, inclusive of our trucking business and improved 180 basis points compared to last year, demonstrating strong year-over-year expansion as our guidance indicated. Now these charts summarize a solid quarter for CSX. Total revenue reached over $3.6 billion for the quarter, up 1% from the same period last year, even with lower fuel surcharge and coal prices. Operating income increased by 7% compared to last year as we delivered strong general margins from top line growth and cost control. Earnings per share grew by 12%, supported by solid results for the business and our commitment capital returns. Our results this quarter demonstrate strong execution that we build powerful momentum behind our proven operating model. We remain motivated as a team, keeping in mind that I've told you since I joined CSX over two years ago, talented people working together as ONE CSX team with a common goal can accomplish just about anything. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike to provide details around our operational performance.\nMike Cory: Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. So, here's a rundown on the operating activities in the quarter. Let me start first, though, by thanking our ONE CSX team for their extremely hard work and their teamwork to deliver solid results through a challenging quarter at times and specifically in certain locations. So, let's go to the first slide on safety. For FRA injuries, not much has changed since the last quarter in terms of metrics. Although we see a higher frequency than our desired target, we're finding the injury severity rate is lower. And as a result, we've seen a reduction in lost days of work for injured employees. For FRA train accidents, we continue to see a year-over-year decrease in incidents. Our biggest improvement has been driven by a reduction in human factor, yard train accidents. Through our safe CSX initiative, we are improving our ability to reduce workplace exposures, and this will continue to drive positive results across the network. We recorded our lowest number of human factor train accidents in September and human factor incidents are our leading cause. And that progress is really great, and it's a great achievement by our employees here at CSX. So looking at the next slide. Our rail road remains fluid, albeit we have had and still have some weather-related challenges. Our overall velocity considering the effects of the weather showed the resiliency of our network. Our ability to maintain our fluidity came directly from the effective response of our field forces and our ops teams and manage changes to our service plan to provide needed service to our customers in an efficient manner throughout this period. Collectively, we're able to ensure our strategy of safe restoration of service was accomplished without injury or accident. And while network speed is extremely important, our focus has been equally strong, ensuring our major engineering work gets accomplished according to the plan. With multiple weather constraints, we were able to stay on plan while maintaining our network velocity. While our dwell metric was affected by weather, we did see an increase of 3% more carloads and moved it with 2% less train starts. So, we continue to manage the inventories in our yards for our customers and always, always look for a more efficient way to move the cars. Whether aside, the team is focused on service and efficiency, and the lessons learned from our response and actions as a team will certainly help in the development of our operating leaders going forward. Over to the last slide, we continue to work with our sales and marketing team to align our operations with the needs of our customers. Excellent service and cost discipline are always at the forefront. Our metrics do reflect weather-related difficulties However, our field forces, as I mentioned earlier, worked extremely efficiently to get us back operating as fast as possible. But the big thing is we did this collectively as a team, with our service group staying close to our customers and communicating important two-way information throughout. Our vast network resilience and faster recovery over our network has allowed us to remain in line with our customers' needs throughout this weather. And I'm very proud of how well the entire team has come together and work to provide service throughout some challenging disruptions. Communication between our service network and field operations team is very strong and continues to strengthen. These last couple of months have provided plenty of opportunities to show what we can do with and for our customers. So, all in all, I'm very proud of the team, and I'm thankful for their efforts in this tough, but very good quarter. Thank you, and over to you, Kevin.\nKevin Boone: All right. Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, as Joe and Mike both mentioned, we were presented with a number of challenges from storms, a strike at our East Coast ports and another temporary outage at our Curtis Bay terminal. We are very proud of the level of communication throughout the CSX team and our focus on serving our customers through these challenges. This was highlighted by our most recent customer survey out just this week with our Net Promoter Score at the highest level since we started measuring. With major storms impacting our network, we are working with our customers on the rebuilding efforts to ensure CSX is able to deliver the building materials and other essential supplies to the areas where they are needed. There's been a lot to manage through even for a railroad with experience of CSX. But working together, we've been able to find creative solutions to keep freight flowing. At a high level, market conditions remain a bit mixed we are seeing continued strength in some of our merchandise markets. And while truck rates appear to have bottomed, there remains a soft market. Diesel and natural gas prices remain low and benchmark coal prices have moderated. All that said, we grew total volumes and revenue over the quarter as our service-led initiatives continue to bring new business to our railroad. The team has continued to build momentum by working with our customers as we're going to continue to push hard against the mixed economic backdrop. And I'm excited about our upcoming Investor Day, where you will hear more from our commercial leaders who are laying the foundation to deliver profitable growth for CSX. Let's first review our merchandise business, as shown on Slide 7. As a whole, merchandise continues to be a great contributor for us. As we anticipated, volume growth accelerated this quarter, supported by new business wins, truck conversions, and the ramp-up of industrial development projects. Revenue gained 6% compared to last year, driven by a 3% gain in volume and solid pricing. Note that with lower diesel prices, fuel surcharge was a drag on both total revenue and reported RPU. On a core basis, our same-store basis, our merchandise pricing remains solid. Chemicals continued its positive performance for the year, delivering a 9% volume increase year-over-year. We see consistent broad strength across plastics, industrial, industrial chemicals, LPGs and waste. And ag and food, the second half inflection has taken off as we had hoped with volume also up 9%, led by grain and feed ingredients that customers turn to the Midwest for supplies. Close collaboration with our operating team has ensured consistent service as the strong seasonal demand has kicked in. Those products also saw great year-over-year growth with healthy improvement in pulp board demand contributing to a 9% volume gain. Some of this new forest product business is shorter length of haul, which was a factor in 3Q reported RPU. Results in our Minerals business were mixed with volume up 1%. Cement is doing very well, supported by construction demand and the ramp up of new customer facilities, but wet rainy weather was a modest drag on aggregate shipments over the quarter. All that said, the underlying long-term trend remains very favorable. Other markets we serve are facing more near-term challenges. As we've highlighted through much of this year, the metals market, particularly steel, remains soft with sluggish demand, ample supply and low commodity prices. One reason for softer metals demand is a weaker-than-anticipated automotive market where conditions have deteriorated. Volumes inflected negatively for us this quarter and mix was also a modest headwind to auto RPU. As Joe mentioned at an investor conference last month, the industry has seen consumer demand diminish by high retail prices and interest rates which has led to higher dealer inventories and slower production. Our belief is that interest rate easing cycle will help these markets normalize. Lastly, total fertilizer volume continued to trend negatively in the third quarter. So, we were able to pick up some favorable spot moves. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see a carryover of solid year-over-year momentum in chemicals, ag and food, forest products and Minerals, while trains and metals continue to be challenged in the near term. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review the coal business. For the third quarter, total coal revenue declined 7%, a 2% decline in volume. As shown in our financial report, we saw export and domestic shipments move in opposite directions with export tonnage increasing by 10% year-over-year and domestic tonnage decreasing by 12%. Low natural gas prices continue to limit the utility burn. All-in coal RPU was down 5% compared to last year and 7.5% sequentially, in line with our guidance last quarter and largely driven by the declines in global benchmarks for metallurgical coal. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, market seem relatively stable. Utility stockpiles are sufficient and though natural gas prices recently approach the $3 mark, do not anticipate any near-term step-up in volumes. Export demand remains consistent, particularly from buyers in Asia and the Australian benchmark has stabilized around the $200 level toward the end of the last quarter. Given the lag in our export contracts, we anticipate a modest to low single-digit sequential decline of all-in coal RPU in the fourth quarter. Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Total revenue declined 2% year-over-year, while volume increased 3%. International shipments grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, while domestic shipments ended up effectively flat for the quarter. As we talked about in past calls, we did see a shift towards West Coast arrivals over the summer, which lifted our transcontinental interchange businesses to the East. We also opened up new business with several customer partners. Overall, we did see the domestic business gain modest momentum over the quarter but activity with some of our main channel partners remains relatively soft. Total intermodal RPU decreased 5%, largely due to lower fuel surcharge and a mix with international outgrowing the domestic business. We're pleased to see a relatively quick short-term solution for the ILA as we did see the effects on our volumes during the strike. The trucking backdrop has remained challenged through 2024, but we do see signs of market conditions bottoming and are well prepared to handle more volumes as the market continues to improve, and the team continues to find new business for the CSX intermodal network. Summing it up, the team performed very well this quarter, especially given the number of external challenges we faced. Still conditions for the fourth quarter are mixed, with certain markets continuing to show positive momentum while other markets remain challenged, including those markets more impacted by the current interest rate environment. We remain consistent throughout market cycles is our commitment to serving our customers and we remain confident that our creativity will continue to create opportunities next year and well into the future. We look forward to sharing more with you in November. Now I'll turn it over to Sean.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. I'd like to start by reiterating our appreciation for the tireless work of our fellow railroaders to help friends, communities and the network recover from the devastating impacts of the recent hurricanes. From a business standpoint, Helene impacted revenue by $10 million to $15 million at the end of the third quarter and drove a small amount of incremental expense. It appears the fourth quarter storm-related impacts will be larger than Q3 and with a current estimate of around $50 million. That includes storm recovery and rerouting costs near $20 million as well as roughly $30 million of net revenue impacts. Additionally, a significant rebuild process is already underway for miles of track and multiple bridges across our Blue Ridge subdivision. While we're still evaluating the scale and timing of these capital expenditures, our early read is that rebuild costs will likely exceed a total of $200 million, and the construction will take us into next year. Now to the discussion of the third quarter results. Capitalizing on powerful momentum generated over the last several quarters, the ONE CSX team delivered 7% operating income growth in the quarter, with EPS up double digits. Our proven operating model and increasingly collaborative approach with customers delivered profitable growth at strong incremental margins. In fact, combined merchandise and intermodal revenue, excluding fuel, has grown by at least 3% for seven consecutive quarters, including 5% growth in the most recent quarter. Total revenue increased by 1%, impacted by lower coal revenue as well as declines in fuel recovery, other revenue and trucking. Expense momentum continued as costs were down 2% with more detail to come on the next slide. Interest and other was stable compared to the prior year while income tax expense increased $16 million, with higher pretax earnings, partly offset by a lower effective rate. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total third quarter expense fell by $36 million. While lower fuel prices were a key driver, other costs were up just slightly as efficiency gains and other items mostly offset costs from inflation and 3% volume growth. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe was up $45 million due to inflation and higher total head count. The sequential cost increase from the second quarter was driven by the July 1 union wage increase along with higher incentive compensation. Employment levels have remained stable throughout this year with carload growth of 3% in excess of 2% head count growth in Q3. I would also note about half of the year-over-year head count increase is from quality trucking conversions of outside party drivers to company drivers. Adjusting for this head count would have been up just 1% versus the prior year. Purchased services and other expense decreased by $25 million driven by lower casualty expense and a favorable inventory adjustment in the quarter, with ongoing efficiency gains, mostly offsetting inflation. Depreciation was up $13 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel costs decreased $73 million driven by a lower gallon price and improved efficiency. The operating team delivered our best quarter of fuel efficiency in three years, benefiting from both tactical operating initiatives and increased utilization of fuel-saving technology. Equipment and rents decreased by $3 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $7 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13. Free cash flow continues to be strong at over $2.2 billion. Investing for the safety, reliability and long-term growth of our railroad continues to be our first priority use of capital. After fully funding these investments, we remain committed to our balanced and opportunistic approach to returning cash and have distributed over $1.9 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. Economic profit highlights our priority to grow operating income while maintaining capital discipline and pursuing high-return investments while lower year-to-date economic profit grew in the third quarter. We remain focused on increasing economic profit over the long term and are confident that focus aligns with the interest of our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Sean. Now I will finish our prepared remarks by going over the guidance updates for the remainder of the year. As I outlined at the beginning of the call, we are proud of what our ONE CSX team delivered in the third quarter. As planned, we grew volumes, revenue and operating margin. Now going into the fourth quarter, near-term conditions look modestly more challenging. As I mentioned at an investor conference last month, we knew that lowered diesel prices and the decline in global benchmarks for met coal will be a drag on revenue over the second half and the fourth quarter specifically. Since then, we've gone through two hurricanes in our service region, and have also seen volumes softened in a couple of key customer segments like metals and automotive, a bit more than we were expecting. Practically, this means that we expect modest volume growth in the fourth quarter supported by favorable markets like chemicals and ag as Kevin talked about, that continue to perform very well for us. Lower fuel and coal prices, together with that modest volume growth are leading us to expect a slight decrease in total revenue for the fourth quarter. As we show here, we estimate that lower fuel surcharge and the total effects of a slightly softer coal market will lead to roughly $200 million in revenue effects year-over-year just on their own. Our merchandise franchise continues to run very well, and our operations team is pushing ahead with efficiency measures that are having real benefits. However, slightly lower revenue combined with additional expenses as we reroute and rebuild after the hurricanes are going to limit our near-term margin gains. We are still aiming for $2.5 billion in total CapEx this year. As Sean described, we will likely see some additional capital needs for hurricane rebuilding, some of which will occur in 2024 calendar year. Finally, there is no change to our commitment to a balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns via buybacks and a growing dividend. Let me close with this. We give many updates today. There is some near-term uncertainty in the market, and we are rebuilding after two major hurricanes. So we have had to adjust our short-term assumptions in response. All that said, the bottom line is that CSX is running very well, and we are building momentum across the railroad. This continues across the second half of 2024, and we'll keep building into 2025. We are excited and just in a few weeks, we'll be hosting many of you at our Investor Day in Amelia Island, we are going to give you more detail on our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. We encourage you to bring your best questions for the whole team. For now, we're ready to answer your question about the quarter. Matthew, please start the Q&A process.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Joe. We will now proceed to our question-and-answer session. As you all can appreciate, to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to take part in the time that we have, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Operator, we're ready to start the process.\nOperator: The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Just wanted to ask a big picture question about price cost and your ability or how strongly you think you can get back to a positive spread in price cost next year. You have the labor negotiations that have already set a price for increase on the average comp side. So maybe you can give us a little bit of sense in terms of how those conversations are going with customers now that, that market is already being set in the market? And if there's anything on the other side you have to get out of those negotiations when you work towards more of the work rest tools?\nSean Pelkey: Brian, it's Sean. I'll start and then kind of kick it over to Kevin to talk about conversations with the customers. But just when you think about price cost, we've been consistent saying all year long, that spread between dollars of price and cost of inflation has been positive all year long and about as positive as we've seen in the last decade. So, we're not necessarily seeing anything negative in that regard and not seeing a turn in that either so that's very favorable. In terms of kind of the setup in the inflationary environment for next year, wage inflation. We expect north of 4% next year, these tentative agreements, some of which have already been ratified or at 4% midyear next year. We have 4.5%. We just increased here in July. So that will carry forward. That's 4.25% for next year for wages. Health and welfare expenses look like they may actually be lower than that. So, I think wage inflation, including health and welfare will actually be less than 4%. And then inflation across the rest of the book likely to kind of be in line with what you're seeing in terms of overall PPI, maybe call it, 2.5%, 2% to 3%, somewhere in that ballpark. So, it's not like the equation is extraordinarily challenging. And I think -- kick it over to Kevin to talk about conversations and how that's going with the customers.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think there's a couple of factors. Certainly, I think we've been highly successful this year and exceeded our plan coming into the year despite a trucking market that obviously has been more persistently down than what we had thought. So, I think that's probably an opportunity next year. So, it's a watch item, but probably more an opportunity than a risk. Hopefully, as we move through the year. And that's where we're competing today more and more versus that truck. And so that would be a helpful dynamic for us. But overall, we do expect inflation to come down over time, and that would be reflected in some of our price, but we still obviously look for ways to cover our costs and do those things in the right way, but really focus on delivering service. And if we deliver the right service and that service continues to improve, then customers see the value in that and we're able to price to that service.\nJoe Hinrichs: And Brian, it's Joe. One last thing. You mentioned work roles at the end there, three-part question. The reality is, Mike, myself, many of us believe that in order to have the real meaningful conversations with our union partners on safety and work rules, you have to get beyond the wages and the benefits conversation. And that's one of the reasons why we've been so fortunate to reach these type of agreements, and be able to get past that so that we can then spend the time over the next several years working together on improving our efficiency, improving our safety, but also listening to our employees on their needs for work rules for work-life balance, those kind of things we're scheduling. And we're excited about the opportunity to do that in partnership once we get past the kind of national bargaining type topics of general wage increases and benefits. And Sean mentioned that we're really excited about the fact that we're actually going to be able to reduce some of the health care-related costs associated with our union employees next year. So, a lot more to come on that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ari Rosa of Citi. Your line is open.\nAri Rosa: So, I'm curious, obviously, we're dealing with a loose trucking market. It's been that way for a while. In terms of upside to intermodal pricing for next year, maybe you could give us some indication on how those conversations are progressing with customers? And then obviously, 1% revenue growth is a little bit soft, is there anything you can do in terms of mix to maybe accelerate that beyond that kind of low single-digit type number, whether it's focusing more on the merchandise side or again, fixing that mix on the intermodal pricing?\nKevin Boone: Yes. Well, obviously, the success we've had in merchandise is a very good mix factor for our business. And you'll hear in November that there's a lot of exciting things that we see but within our merchandise markets and what we're doing and the teams that got a lot of great work, but I won't to preempt that today, and we'll share that in November. But when we think about intermodal pricing, there was an intermodal customer of ours that spoke yesterday, and they're certainly closer to the market dynamics on a day-to-day basis than maybe we are. But I think there is some hope that at least we brought them here and at some point next year, we would anticipate some increases because the truckers out there aren't very profitable right now, and they end up having to cover their costs at some point. So, we're seeing probably slower than people expected supply coming out of the market, and that will adjust, and I think that will provide opportunities to convert more volume in the East and hopefully at better rates. And as you know, in many cases, we're tied to that. So, we have some spot market business and others, we follow the price as our customers benefit from that. So, it will be a gradual path forward, but I do think it's probably a better backdrop than what we saw in 2024.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chappell: Sean, you throw a lot of numbers at us on the short-term stuff, $200 million from fuel and coal and then the $50 million from the hurricane impact. I know it's still early in the quarter, I know there's a lot that can happen. But when you take those things, mix in kind of the softer auto and metals, when you talk about revenue being down moderately and operating margin reducing. So, I'm guessing that's deteriorated sequentially. What kind of magnitude are we looking at there? Are we talking about tens of basis points or substantially greater based on what you see today?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Jonathan. There are a lot of numbers. So yes, and you got them all right. So, thank you. So, Joe mentioned the revenue headwinds, those are year-over-year in terms of fuel and coal. That probably translates into about $100 million of operating income headwinds year-over-year in Q4. nd then add on that, what we're estimating for now to be roughly $50 million from the hurricane, that's a significant headwind on a year-over-year basis that will make it challenging to grow operating income challenging to grow margins. What that means on a sequential basis is normally, you would see seasonality Q3 to Q4 margins might get a little bit worse. They'll probably be worse than normal seasonality as a result of all the dynamics that we're seeing there including the impact of the storms. In terms of how much worse, I think we're still working through cleanup and recovery, still hoping that we can recover some of the revenue that's been lost and obviously, keeping focused on efficiency efforts. Mike mentioned, even with volume up 3%, we took starts down 3% in the third quarter. So, there's a lot of momentum there. There are some things that we can do to help offset it. But it will certainly be worse than normal seasonality in terms of margins and operating income Q3 to Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: So, Mike, as you're trying to balance service and efficiency, any thoughts on head count trends from here and overall sort of cost trends? And then, Sean, I know you had a comment about the comp per employee stepping up sequentially, any thoughts on how to think about that going forward?\nMike Cory: Let's start with headcount. First of all, our focus is on retention when it comes to headcount. Overall, we're hiring for attrition, people leaving and it's actually at an escalated rate than what we want. So that's a big focus is to bring that rate down because there's churn in the headcount, people that are here for two years and so and then they leave. Second, we're good in pretty much every location with a couple of locations in the Northeast that we're still hiring for. It's not a big number. But I don't see -- I see our head count getting better for that matter as we get more fluid. You got to remember -- maybe you don't, but in July, we probably had our best operating and customer service metric month throughout the year, and then we got into all these difficulties. So, getting the railway back in shape here over the next few weeks is job number one. The cost that you referred to -- our focus is to continue to deliver the service, but make sure that we're extremely efficient not hung up on anything other than the cost it takes us to get there and what they need. And so I see the cost continuing to be a betterment there, it's just with the disruption to our network. As Sean has mentioned, this next quarter is going to be not where we want to be, but the approach we've taken where we've minimized the amount of starts through all this disruption still handled more volume. I see more of that, yes. No question.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. And I'd just add on the head count piece there, Scott. We normally -- at least last year, we saw an increase in head count from Q3 to Q4. We'll probably see an increase this year, just very modest. And the reason for that is you've got the train and engine hiring pipeline, what we're hiring for right now essentially is midyear next year, vacation peak so those folks will get marked up and qualified right about the time and attrition gets a little bit higher about that time. But that will be modest, we still expect volume to grow in excess of headcount, especially when you normalize for the quality company driver piece that I talked about. In terms of comp per employee, we normally see a little bit of a step up Q3 to Q4, and that's related to a few different factors. The first is that you start winding up some of your capital programs. So, we have employees that charge more of their time to operating expense at that time of the year, vacations as well. And then I would add on to that, this year, the impacts of the storm driving some higher overtime in the early weeks of the quarter here. So all those factors, I don't think it's going to be significant, but we should see a little bit of an increase in labor per employee.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Two questions really for Kevin. How do you think about the sensitivity of you're doing this multiyear work and industrial development, a lot of -- kind of, I guess, a long-time horizon work? Do you think there's some degree of sensitivity those projects to the cycle? It does seem like you talked about a mixed outlook, and it seems like there have been some weakening in certain markets in 3Q, is that something that people slow down projects? And I don't know if there is some kind of election-related impact. But just wanted to see if you could offer any thoughts about maybe how cycle and other uncertainty might affect how rapidly projects come on in '25, '26.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think -- it's certainly a factor. And I think we've seen announcements, obviously, on the EV side, which is actually -- you'll see this in November, a very small portion of our portfolio, and we've adjusted for that when you see the portfolio. But that is a factor. I mean, with the economics, what the economy is doing at the time will either accelerate or decelerate some of these. But when the shovel is in the ground and the capital is already being put to work, those projects want to obviously go to utilization and get a return. And we're seeing a lot of these projects have shovels in the ground currently. So, we have a lot of visibility that they're going to happen. Could they slip by three months or six months? I think that's possible. We're not -- I don't think we're seeing it in a broad way other than maybe the EV, obviously, announcements that we've seen, but those are 6 to 12 months ago. So yes, I think that's a factor, but I think we feel very, very confident given what we've seen in the capital already spent in a lot of these larger projects for us that those are going to be tailwinds for us. And we'll give you a lot more visibility to that in November.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBrandon Oglenski: Joe, I know you addressed this with the first one, but maybe I think it's worth coming back to the new five-year agreement that you guys signed with, I think, 3.5% inflation locked in. A lot of investors just question like why go early there, especially as inflation is coming down, like couldn't you get a better deal if you waited? But in your response, you said like there's things we're looking to do differently here. And I know when you came to this industry two years ago, you said, look, labor relations are something I want to focus on. So, can you elaborate on what you hope to get out of this on the other end?\nJoe Hinrichs: Sure, Brandon. Thanks. I mean, first of all, when we all travel the network and talk to our employees, I can tell you the single largest thing, other than safety, which is always a topic of conversation that employees told us was they didn't like what happened last time. They didn't feel at any way, shape or form part of ONE team and didn't feel like they were appreciated in value. They went three years without a raise during very highly inflationary time period and during COVID, when they were essential workers and all the things that happened there. And both the union presidents that we spoke to and the union leaders and the employees all said, we don't want to do that again. And I can tell you, having been there on the days they were voting, Congress told us, don't come back here again. So that's a long way of saying that it's really important to remember that no one was satisfied or happy with what happened last time. So if we just go on the same path we've always been, we'll repeat that. And we'll say, once again, everyone was unhappy. And as Mike talked about, one of the most important things that we do for our network is stabilize our employment levels, get the experienced people to stay and create an environment where people want to be here to help us provide great service and do it safely and efficiently. All those have come from people who are motivated to be part of the team, but also who have experience and stay here. So, we sat down as an industry and talked a lot about what happened last time, and we endeavored as a coalition to try and reach a voluntary agreement early with willing Union Partners, which was over several -- we weren't able to do it as a coalition, but then quickly we were able to do that with CSX. And as you saw in Oakland Southern and BNSF followed pretty quickly. The good news here is there's been basically a pattern established, for lack of a better word, of what the economics are going to be. Sean mentioned, there's going to be some health care reduction costs coming to us and to our employees next year, which is great. But also, we start with the 4% next year, but the fifth year is at 3.0% and that's really important. So, it goes 4%, 3.75%, 3.5%, 3.25%, 3% that's really important because yes, inflation is coming down. You have to remember that we're in an environment where people are seeing these headlines from Boeing or the ILA or other things that are bigger numbers because they're going back to periods before COVID in some cases where they didn't get extensive raises. So, there's a lot of mixed messaging out there. Our view is this is the right approach for CSX, it's the right approach for how we're working as ONE CSX team to make sure our employees feel valued and appreciated and respected and listened to and that our belief is that you get the national agreements out of the way on the wages and benefits and then you can go to work on how you work together to improve the efficiency of the network, work on safety, as Mike talked about, and also listen to other issues that need to be resolved. We have five years to work on that now without the noise of the national negotiations. If you look at what happened last time, we never really got too many of the local work rule stuff because we -- took three years through the national agreement. So that's how we're looking at it. I think you can see the efficiency that we saw in the third quarter and the incremental margins on the volume in the third quarter were substantial. And that's the power of this network when we have our employees and everybody working together to serve the customer efficiently.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Christian Wetherbee of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChristian Wetherbee: I know it sounds like fourth quarter from a margin standpoint, difficult to make year-over-year headway given some of the headwinds that you're talking about which makes sense. I guess when you think about it for a full year, I think that probably means sort of little margin in '24. I know I'm asking you guys to look out a little bit here, but kind of conceptually, with the environment that we have today with sort of weakness in some areas, maybe some strength in some company-specific strengths in other parts of your network. Is this the type of environment that you think you can consistently grow margins in? I guess what are the sort of puts and takes that you think you need to see as we move into '25 for that to continue to happen or resume to happen again?\nSean Pelkey: Yes, Christian, thanks for your question. Obviously, for '25 specifically, we're still in the middle of the planning process, so it's a bit early to kind of definitively say anything. But what I would say, broadly speaking, and longer term, we'll highlight this at the investor conference in a few weeks as well is the setup for CSX in terms of where the service product is at how that's impacting the customer experience and the interactions that that's creating, which translate into growth opportunities, not to mention continuing to be able to price at or above inflation is very supportive. The other piece of that, of course, is the fact that the network has capacity. We have locomotives, we have crews. Like Mike mentioned, there are some places we're still hiring. But for the most part, we're only hiring for attrition, we've got line of road capacity. So, you take all that together, it's a good setup for strong incremental margins. There's always things, we can't control that could make it more challenging or easier for us to achieve margin improvement and operating income growth, which, frankly, is the first goal. Operating margin is really sort of the outcome of all of it as we grow into the existing capacity. Fuel prices are down. If you look at where they're expected to be next year, it should be another headwind for us. Export coal prices seem to have stabilized. But if you carry that out to next year, that would be a headwind for us next year. We're going to do a lot of construction on the Howard Street Tunnel next year in Baltimore that will cause some reroutes, some network disruption, not to mention the rebuild coming out of these storms. So, there are some things that will make it a little more challenging. We may see some tailwinds from the trucking market. We're watching that closely and hopeful that the environment there is a little easier next year than it was the previous year. But certainly, longer term, having the capacity to grow and continuing to deliver a consistent high level of service to the customer is a winning equation for us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Your line is open.\nDaniel Imbro: I guess, Kevin, I wanted to dig into just the volume growth side. I mean you mentioned some share wins in truck to rail conversions. I'm curious if you can just add more color around maybe the cadence of wins or what categories they fell into during the quarter. And then I think there's some concerns out among investors around merchandise pricing. So, I'm curious how is merchandise pricing out in the market today? And are you seeing business that you're winning being more price competitive than past bids? Or there's any change in that as you win this business?\nKevin Boone: Yes. We certainly compete every day, right? And we have a great service product that's only getting better, and that's obviously been reemphasized by some of the surveys that we do with our customers. So that's certainly a lot easier environment to sell into that than in an environment where your service isn't great. And we experienced that a couple of years ago where we were challenged with obviously head count and some other things. So, nothing's changed from that perspective, and the team is focused on that. We want to deliver value to the customer and the value -- when we're able to do that through service, the customers are willing to pay for it. And we're always looking for ways where we can provide value outside of price, can we cycle their assets and reduce their capital spend and do other things that create efficiencies for our customers. And those are great discussions that we have all the time and probably more so today that with Mike and his team are being very helpful in those conversations. So, there's not a big dramatic change in that. As we go into next year, as I mentioned, the trucking market, Sean touched on this, I think that's helpful. We are successfully converting truck volume in our merchandise franchise, which I can say is probably more than what we've done since I've been in this role. And we've got a momentum around that. What could even inflect that higher is certainly a tighter trucking market where customers aren't seeing savings by doing nothing. When you sit around and you have to do nothing, you're getting savings, you're not as compelled to maybe move some of that freight over to the rail. When that changes, and that environment changes, I think the team is really ready to capitalize on that. So, I think that's -- we're hopefully in the early innings of that. But despite all of those headwinds on the trucking market, we have converted in areas across the board, and you're seeing it in our numbers, forest products in other areas, metals and equipment. We expect some great conversion there over time by the team, and we see those opportunities more and more as we move into next year and the years beyond that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jordan Alliger of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJordan Alliger: Just a question. You indicated in your remarks that you're seeing a modest improvement or uptick or something along those lines for domestic intermodal. I'm wondering if you can give a little more color on that kind of looking now relative to international, which I know had been really driving things in intermodal. And is it enough to sort of move the needle on your yield for intermodal at this point?\nKevin Boone: I think at this point, we're safe to call that it feels like the bottoming, certainly, and that gives us hope that we've reached that how -- what the inflection will be and look like. That's a watch item for us. There was talk and pull forward, we're not hearing about that as much, but that's TBD. We expected hopefully a more normalized peak season, but that's a watch item for us, but we're optimistic that, that will occur, and we're planning for that as well. So, we do think the fundamentals don't support a lot of the trucking supply out there, and that's going to rebalance certainly, probably took a lot longer to rebalance given some of the influx of profitability they experienced during the pandemic. And so, they were sitting on a lot more cash to ride this cycle out than maybe previous cycles. Hopefully, I think you'll learn through the earnings calls with the other truckers and others that they're seeing some stability as well. But we're seeing stability, I wouldn't say an inflection at this point.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about some of the diverted volumes that you called out ahead of just the labor negotiations and potential strike in the East Coast. Maybe if you could talk about the impact that you did see during the quarter? And then kind of what you're hearing and seeing now in terms of those volumes returning back to normal flows and normal to the East Coast?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean it was a little bit modest. We did see some shipments naturally move over to the West Coast, and then we would have benefited from that moving from the West to the East, but it was relatively modest. We did see some impact, obviously, with the port shutdown on the East Coast. You saw that for a few days and then I've got to tell you that our operating group on the intermodal side was ready to ramp back up immediately. So very little disruption coming out of it. But those were some lost days that we would expect to recover through the rest of the quarter but it did impact us on a near-term basis.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Maybe you talk a little bit about export coal demand and the stability in the market given the growing importance and volatility, how stable can we look at this level of demand? Because obviously, we talked about the benchmark pricing and what happens on the yield side. And then Joe, Mike, you mentioned the service levels multiple times. How do we align the service levels with what we get to see, which is the erosion in the on-time originations and arrivals down into the low 70s, upper 60s, maybe you can just walk us through that?\nKevin Boone: Export coal, my favorite subject. I think when you look at this market over a long period of time, in any cyclical market do you see supply response when the prices are really good and then you obviously see demand response when the macro is not so great globally. What I do think is different going forward is you don't see the supply response like you did in the past. Obviously, the financing and other investments aren't there to bring on new volume into the market. And I think that's a better backdrop for the market we serve and the mines that we serve today in the global competitive environment. So, I'm hopeful that, that creates more price stability longer term. And the other thing is their cost his risen globally as well. And so, I think the natural price for coal is probably going to stabilize above where it is today, and that gives me hope that we'll see better pricing environment going forward. Certainly, what you've seen here recently is a China stimulus, and that's been the talk, right? And they are a big consumer of coal in the global market. And that has given some optimism there that, that could recover. So, it's a global -- we compete in the global market. Our customers compete in the global market, but I do think the supply or the lack of supply response going forward is probably a healthier environment for us and makes me optimistic on our met business, in particular, that we'll see that more stable in the future.\nJoe Hinrichs: Sorry, it was a two-part question. Look, Ken, to put it as basic as I can, we really focus on the CSD number. So, if you want a number, that's the one -- that's our first and last mile. That's the one we say customer basically lets us know what they need and we bring it. So how we get the cars there on the trains, regardless of the weather conditions, we have a big automotive network that we don't necessarily -- we run a scheduled plan, but it changes quite a bit between loading. So, we don't change the train schedules other than to modify to where they're going to. So, the on-time performance isn't as important as the car cycle and that's how we look at it. So yes, you're right. We want to be like -- seven out of 10 trains are running on time, what we're watching for is to make sure the cars that are on those trains are getting to where they need to fulfill the customers' needs. You can take dwell, you can take car velocity, all those things, you're trying to balance it, first of all, the service product you promise to deliver, and that's really back to the CSD number. That's the one we look for that. And then how we get it there, we're trying to do it the cheapest and most efficient way. So, I'm not saying it's not important, but we have been very those last not just those weather here, but this last six months since I've been here, we have been really trying to find a way to fund the efficiency and the service. And the numbers right now, I'm not going to say they're blurred. They're all important, but we're balancing each one. And yes, disruptions hurt our on-time performance and that has been reflected this last quarter. Like I said, if you go back to July, you can start to see where we're going. So, it is a focus, but it's one of a few that we balance to get those end results.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBen Nolan: Yes. I wanted to ask a little bit just on pricing. It seems like the one area or one of the areas where we actually have been able to get a little bit better pricing is on the chemical side. Is that -- chemical specifically, is that just a function of a healthy market where there is some pricing ability? Is it maybe starting to see some impact from quality or just maybe talk through how the chemical part of the business is evolving?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think there's a lot of factors that obviously play in the RPU length of haul, all those things. I don't see the chemical market really that different from some of our other merchandise markets where we've been successful. So, I know optically maybe on an RPU basis, that appears to be the case. But I think when you look at across that merchandise portfolio, there's really not a big deviation between the markets as our service continues to get better, as I mentioned before, as we deliver, as we can cycle their cars faster and save them capital, all those things factor in and deliver value to the customer in other ways where we can monetize that through price.\nOperator: From the line of Jason Seidl of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: I wanted to talk a little bit about intermodal yields. I mean there was a lot of movement of freight from the East Coast to the West Coast in anticipation of the port strike. Do you see that switching back? And if so, what sort of impact should we expect on the yields? And then I guess I'd throw a quick one here, too. How are you feeling going to that January 15 date the ILA, do you think it could be Strike fears 2.0?\nKevin Boone: I don't have any inside look at how that's going, but it certainly will be a watch item for us. I'm hopeful that obviously, the agreement will become well before that and create some -- and eliminate some of the uncertainty that, that could create again for us. When I think about freight and the movement of freight, it naturally wants to move to a certain port and efficiently. And so you've seen the East Coast outperform the West Coast over time. Some of that's because of the manufacturing shift you're seeing, some of that away from China and other parts of the world and more naturally wants the land on the East Coast. I think that continues from everything as you see us trying to decouple from China and those factors, and that's a great thing for us. If you look at the investments that are being made on the East Coast versus the West Coast, I think those are supportive of outgrowth, and we'll participate in that as well. But in many ways, we're somewhat agnostic if again, if freight wants to move in the west and move to the East Coast, that's not a bad thing for us. That would traditionally would truck and so that's an opportunity for us. I do think over time, as we continue to see the East Coast volumes continue to increase, I think we can push more into Chicago and other areas. That's an opportunity, and we'll see that further play out here over time. And then the underline port strategy that we have is going to create a lot of value, and it's going to open up opportunities for our customers look differently at shifting even more freight over to the East Coast because we can efficiently move it in inland with our East Coast ports in a very, very efficient way. So, I don't think we'll get through this noise on the -- obviously, the labor negotiations. But overall, I think the trend continues and we're going to benefit from that as a railroad.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bascome Majors of Susquehanna. Your line is open. Bascome, perhaps your line is in on mute. Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin: Just curious on the competitive marketplace. I know there was a lot of discussion on truck, but I know your main competitor on the rail side is affecting quite some meaningful changes that is leading to impacts on their service. I'm wondering if you're seeing that come up in the marketplace at all? Are you seeing any -- is there any larger contracts that are coming up that you see as either an opportunity or a risk here? Just to get a better handle on how much of an improvement in your competitors operations is affecting or impacting you in terms of winning or losing business in the marketplace.\nKevin Boone: Yes. I think -- look, as I mentioned before, we compete every day. We compete knowing that we have very, very good service that continues to improve. And I think the customers have seen that stability in the leadership team that we have though, the consistency of our message and what we're trying to achieve and they understand our objectives, which is to grow with them. I think that's very helpful when you get into those discussions that they understand where we're going and that there's still going to be stability among the leadership team and the team that we've built. So, we continue to have a very, very effective cost base. We can compete when we need to compete both on service and cost. And I think in those cases, we're going to be very, very competitive, and we're going to be winners in that situation. So, we're focused, obviously, on other opportunities, too. We want to grow the pie. We want to grow the market. We want to move the freight that's not moving on rail as well. And I think having those discussions along with retaining our own business is really helpful in retaining that business. So that's where we're focused on right now is growing the pie. And I think we're going to have a lot of success. We've had a lot of success this year, and we're going to continue to have that success as we move into next year and the years beyond that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: So, Joe, it sounds like you invested a lot in the culture part of the equation. I'm wondering if you can share some perspective on how some of the churn rates or turnover rates, however you guys measure them internally, internal Net Promoter Scores, that kind of stuff, has changed as a result of those investments?\nJoe Hinrichs: Yes. Thanks, David. I mean First of all, we look at many metrics, but as we've talked about many times, culture is kind of hard to measure. I've likened it to love, which is you kind of know it when you feel it, but you can't really measure it. That being said, we see it in many ways. For example, we do Net Promoter Scores with our employees. And both on our management side and our union side, those numbers have moved meaningfully in the last two years. They're not where we want them to be on the union side. And we still have work to do there, but they've come up significantly from where they were just two years ago. Mike mentioned what we're looking at in the form of attrition, both in our new hires, but also mid to longer term hires. Attrition rate on new hires is really important to us because we invest six-plus months of training in them as a conductor. And if we lose them, after all that, we have to start again, especially in some key sites so that's really important. But it's more than that. I mean, if you look at the efficiency gains we're getting on, quarter-over-quarter over quarter this year, and importantly, Kevin mentioned it, the best Net Promoter scores we've ever had since we've been measuring on our customer side, those are all impacted by attitudes and the work that our employees do. And if they feel part of the team and feel listen to and valued and appreciated, they're going to give us a better outcome for our customers and better efficiency in a safer environment for everybody. So, it's hard to measure with one thing, but I can tell you that we feel very strongly that we're seeing the efforts that we put in and the results that come from that. We've had roughly 20 family days, there were 30,000 people attending, it's the kind of environment where people want to be a part of. People are telling us over and over again, they're proud to wear CSX gear in their communities again. All those things are important for retention and attracting talent, but they're also important for how people work together. I've said many times, this is a service business and service business must really work hard on their cultures and their employee engagement because the employees are the ones who provide the service. And if you would have seen all the notes we've received this year, from our employees thanking us for reaching out to every employee in the regions impacted by the hurricanes, making sure they need anything, whether it's a generator or it's water or anything. And the notes I'm receiving and our team is receiving and they know they're not a number. Those things are important in our business. They're important for attrition -- sorry, they're important for retention, but they're also important for the energy that we have that feeds into ultimately our customers. So, we believe it's working and you can see it in the numbers. And Sean mentioned we have seven quarters in a row now where we've grown merchandise intermodal revenue by 3% or more at seven quarters in a row in an environment that's been complicated and you also see it in the resiliency of our network and how quickly we respond to issues and how quickly we can get back up and running. I mean -- the last thing and you've heard a lot about weather and hurricanes today, and you probably -- you don't want to hear any more about it, but the people that have been around here a long time, 30-plus years, are telling me that the impact of Helene on our network is the second most impactful hurricane they've seen at CSX, Katrina being the worst. I tell you the scale of things we're dealing with. And yet we're talking about an impact of $50 million in the quarter. As Sean noted, Obviously, we have some significant capital cost to rebuild the network, but that's people working together with a spirit and a motivation. It doesn't come if people don't feel like they're part of ONE CSX team. So, also been getting national agreements done before they expire. That's never happened in the railroad industry. Those are examples of things that are happening because of our culture and because of how we're working together. Ultimately, that plays out in the customer service we deliver in the safety, we actually deliver. And Mike mentioned it, our severity rate is down dramatically in injuries over the last several months. That's really important. The injury rate hasn't really moved, but severity rates moved dramatically. That's the kind of thing you get when people are working together and their culture builds from there.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our time that we have for Q&A. And with no further questions, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your attendance. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Joe Hinrichs",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone, and thank you for joining our third quarter call today. First, I want to thank our entire ONE CSX team who've been tireless in helping our employees and their communities recover from the hardships caused by two hurricanes in a matter of weeks. Helene, in particular, had a big impact on our network, and we'll talk more about that today. We have largely recovered, and we have made sure that CSX has been able to support our railroaders who have needed the systems for themselves and their families. That said, there's more work that we will need to do to repair and replace some of the physical infrastructure that we lost, which Mike and Sean will discuss later on this call. Now stepping back and looking at this entire quarter, I am proud of what we accomplished. Our aim was to grow volume, revenue and operating margin compared to last year, and that is exactly what we delivered. Our merchandise franchise continues to grow at an impressive pace, benefiting from our service leadership and the numerous initiatives that Kevin and his team are pursuing to bring new business to CSX. Operationally, our efficiency and cost controls remain solid we're still only getting started with some of the ways that we are using valuable, real-time data to optimize our network. We have had our challenges. This quarter, we had to adapt and respond to significant weather events, equipment issues at our coal terminal and lower diesel prices. Throughout, we've kept our focus on our long-term goals to deliver consistent, sustainable, profitable growth over time. Now let's go over some of the highlights. On Slide 1, it shows our key results from our third quarter compared to last year. Despite the severe weather, we were still able to publish some very good results across the Company. Looking across the highlights listed on this top line. Total volume grew by 3% versus last year, where by strong performance in our core merchandise business where volume also grew by 3%. Merchandise revenue grew by impressive 6%, supported by 3% growth in volume and favorable pricing. Our operating margin reached 37.4%, inclusive of our trucking business and improved 180 basis points compared to last year, demonstrating strong year-over-year expansion as our guidance indicated. Now these charts summarize a solid quarter for CSX. Total revenue reached over $3.6 billion for the quarter, up 1% from the same period last year, even with lower fuel surcharge and coal prices. Operating income increased by 7% compared to last year as we delivered strong general margins from top line growth and cost control. Earnings per share grew by 12%, supported by solid results for the business and our commitment capital returns. Our results this quarter demonstrate strong execution that we build powerful momentum behind our proven operating model. We remain motivated as a team, keeping in mind that I've told you since I joined CSX over two years ago, talented people working together as ONE CSX team with a common goal can accomplish just about anything. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike to provide details around our operational performance. All right. Thank you, Sean. Now I will finish our prepared remarks by going over the guidance updates for the remainder of the year. As I outlined at the beginning of the call, we are proud of what our ONE CSX team delivered in the third quarter. As planned, we grew volumes, revenue and operating margin. Now going into the fourth quarter, near-term conditions look modestly more challenging. As I mentioned at an investor conference last month, we knew that lowered diesel prices and the decline in global benchmarks for met coal will be a drag on revenue over the second half and the fourth quarter specifically. Since then, we've gone through two hurricanes in our service region, and have also seen volumes softened in a couple of key customer segments like metals and automotive, a bit more than we were expecting. Practically, this means that we expect modest volume growth in the fourth quarter supported by favorable markets like chemicals and ag as Kevin talked about, that continue to perform very well for us. Lower fuel and coal prices, together with that modest volume growth are leading us to expect a slight decrease in total revenue for the fourth quarter. As we show here, we estimate that lower fuel surcharge and the total effects of a slightly softer coal market will lead to roughly $200 million in revenue effects year-over-year just on their own. Our merchandise franchise continues to run very well, and our operations team is pushing ahead with efficiency measures that are having real benefits. However, slightly lower revenue combined with additional expenses as we reroute and rebuild after the hurricanes are going to limit our near-term margin gains. We are still aiming for $2.5 billion in total CapEx this year. As Sean described, we will likely see some additional capital needs for hurricane rebuilding, some of which will occur in 2024 calendar year. Finally, there is no change to our commitment to a balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns via buybacks and a growing dividend. Let me close with this. We give many updates today. There is some near-term uncertainty in the market, and we are rebuilding after two major hurricanes. So we have had to adjust our short-term assumptions in response. All that said, the bottom line is that CSX is running very well, and we are building momentum across the railroad. This continues across the second half of 2024, and we'll keep building into 2025. We are excited and just in a few weeks, we'll be hosting many of you at our Investor Day in Amelia Island, we are going to give you more detail on our strategy to deliver sustainable, profitable growth. We encourage you to bring your best questions for the whole team. For now, we're ready to answer your question about the quarter. Matthew, please start the Q&A process. And Brian, it's Joe. One last thing. You mentioned work roles at the end there, three-part question. The reality is, Mike, myself, many of us believe that in order to have the real meaningful conversations with our union partners on safety and work rules, you have to get beyond the wages and the benefits conversation. And that's one of the reasons why we've been so fortunate to reach these type of agreements, and be able to get past that so that we can then spend the time over the next several years working together on improving our efficiency, improving our safety, but also listening to our employees on their needs for work rules for work-life balance, those kind of things we're scheduling. And we're excited about the opportunity to do that in partnership once we get past the kind of national bargaining type topics of general wage increases and benefits. And Sean mentioned that we're really excited about the fact that we're actually going to be able to reduce some of the health care-related costs associated with our union employees next year. So, a lot more to come on that. Sure, Brandon. Thanks. I mean, first of all, when we all travel the network and talk to our employees, I can tell you the single largest thing, other than safety, which is always a topic of conversation that employees told us was they didn't like what happened last time. They didn't feel at any way, shape or form part of ONE team and didn't feel like they were appreciated in value. They went three years without a raise during very highly inflationary time period and during COVID, when they were essential workers and all the things that happened there. And both the union presidents that we spoke to and the union leaders and the employees all said, we don't want to do that again. And I can tell you, having been there on the days they were voting, Congress told us, don't come back here again. So that's a long way of saying that it's really important to remember that no one was satisfied or happy with what happened last time. So if we just go on the same path we've always been, we'll repeat that. And we'll say, once again, everyone was unhappy. And as Mike talked about, one of the most important things that we do for our network is stabilize our employment levels, get the experienced people to stay and create an environment where people want to be here to help us provide great service and do it safely and efficiently. All those have come from people who are motivated to be part of the team, but also who have experience and stay here. So, we sat down as an industry and talked a lot about what happened last time, and we endeavored as a coalition to try and reach a voluntary agreement early with willing Union Partners, which was over several -- we weren't able to do it as a coalition, but then quickly we were able to do that with CSX. And as you saw in Oakland Southern and BNSF followed pretty quickly. The good news here is there's been basically a pattern established, for lack of a better word, of what the economics are going to be. Sean mentioned, there's going to be some health care reduction costs coming to us and to our employees next year, which is great. But also, we start with the 4% next year, but the fifth year is at 3.0% and that's really important. So, it goes 4%, 3.75%, 3.5%, 3.25%, 3% that's really important because yes, inflation is coming down. You have to remember that we're in an environment where people are seeing these headlines from Boeing or the ILA or other things that are bigger numbers because they're going back to periods before COVID in some cases where they didn't get extensive raises. So, there's a lot of mixed messaging out there. Our view is this is the right approach for CSX, it's the right approach for how we're working as ONE CSX team to make sure our employees feel valued and appreciated and respected and listened to and that our belief is that you get the national agreements out of the way on the wages and benefits and then you can go to work on how you work together to improve the efficiency of the network, work on safety, as Mike talked about, and also listen to other issues that need to be resolved. We have five years to work on that now without the noise of the national negotiations. If you look at what happened last time, we never really got too many of the local work rule stuff because we -- took three years through the national agreement. So that's how we're looking at it. I think you can see the efficiency that we saw in the third quarter and the incremental margins on the volume in the third quarter were substantial. And that's the power of this network when we have our employees and everybody working together to serve the customer efficiently. Sorry, it was a two-part question. Look, Ken, to put it as basic as I can, we really focus on the CSD number. So, if you want a number, that's the one -- that's our first and last mile. That's the one we say customer basically lets us know what they need and we bring it. So how we get the cars there on the trains, regardless of the weather conditions, we have a big automotive network that we don't necessarily -- we run a scheduled plan, but it changes quite a bit between loading. So, we don't change the train schedules other than to modify to where they're going to. So, the on-time performance isn't as important as the car cycle and that's how we look at it. So yes, you're right. We want to be like -- seven out of 10 trains are running on time, what we're watching for is to make sure the cars that are on those trains are getting to where they need to fulfill the customers' needs. You can take dwell, you can take car velocity, all those things, you're trying to balance it, first of all, the service product you promise to deliver, and that's really back to the CSD number. That's the one we look for that. And then how we get it there, we're trying to do it the cheapest and most efficient way. So, I'm not saying it's not important, but we have been very those last not just those weather here, but this last six months since I've been here, we have been really trying to find a way to fund the efficiency and the service. And the numbers right now, I'm not going to say they're blurred. They're all important, but we're balancing each one. And yes, disruptions hurt our on-time performance and that has been reflected this last quarter. Like I said, if you go back to July, you can start to see where we're going. So, it is a focus, but it's one of a few that we balance to get those end results. Yes. Thanks, David. I mean First of all, we look at many metrics, but as we've talked about many times, culture is kind of hard to measure. I've likened it to love, which is you kind of know it when you feel it, but you can't really measure it. That being said, we see it in many ways. For example, we do Net Promoter Scores with our employees. And both on our management side and our union side, those numbers have moved meaningfully in the last two years. They're not where we want them to be on the union side. And we still have work to do there, but they've come up significantly from where they were just two years ago. Mike mentioned what we're looking at in the form of attrition, both in our new hires, but also mid to longer term hires. Attrition rate on new hires is really important to us because we invest six-plus months of training in them as a conductor. And if we lose them, after all that, we have to start again, especially in some key sites so that's really important. But it's more than that. I mean, if you look at the efficiency gains we're getting on, quarter-over-quarter over quarter this year, and importantly, Kevin mentioned it, the best Net Promoter scores we've ever had since we've been measuring on our customer side, those are all impacted by attitudes and the work that our employees do. And if they feel part of the team and feel listen to and valued and appreciated, they're going to give us a better outcome for our customers and better efficiency in a safer environment for everybody. So, it's hard to measure with one thing, but I can tell you that we feel very strongly that we're seeing the efforts that we put in and the results that come from that. We've had roughly 20 family days, there were 30,000 people attending, it's the kind of environment where people want to be a part of. People are telling us over and over again, they're proud to wear CSX gear in their communities again. All those things are important for retention and attracting talent, but they're also important for how people work together. I've said many times, this is a service business and service business must really work hard on their cultures and their employee engagement because the employees are the ones who provide the service. And if you would have seen all the notes we've received this year, from our employees thanking us for reaching out to every employee in the regions impacted by the hurricanes, making sure they need anything, whether it's a generator or it's water or anything. And the notes I'm receiving and our team is receiving and they know they're not a number. Those things are important in our business. They're important for attrition -- sorry, they're important for retention, but they're also important for the energy that we have that feeds into ultimately our customers. So, we believe it's working and you can see it in the numbers. And Sean mentioned we have seven quarters in a row now where we've grown merchandise intermodal revenue by 3% or more at seven quarters in a row in an environment that's been complicated and you also see it in the resiliency of our network and how quickly we respond to issues and how quickly we can get back up and running. I mean -- the last thing and you've heard a lot about weather and hurricanes today, and you probably -- you don't want to hear any more about it, but the people that have been around here a long time, 30-plus years, are telling me that the impact of Helene on our network is the second most impactful hurricane they've seen at CSX, Katrina being the worst.

Those are examples of things that are happening because of our culture and because of how we're working together. Ultimately, that plays out in the customer service we deliver in the safety, we actually deliver. And Mike mentioned it, our severity rate is down dramatically in injuries over the last several months. That's really important. The injury rate hasn't really moved, but severity rates moved dramatically. That's the kind of thing you get when people are working together and their culture builds from there."

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mike. In the third quarter, as Joe and Mike both mentioned, we were presented with a number of challenges from storms, a strike at our East Coast ports and another temporary outage at our Curtis Bay terminal. We are very proud of the level of communication throughout the CSX team and our focus on serving our customers through these challenges. This was highlighted by our most recent customer survey out just this week with our Net Promoter Score at the highest level since we started measuring. With major storms impacting our network, we are working with our customers on the rebuilding efforts to ensure CSX is able to deliver the building materials and other essential supplies to the areas where they are needed. There's been a lot to manage through even for a railroad with experience of CSX. But working together, we've been able to find creative solutions to keep freight flowing. At a high level, market conditions remain a bit mixed we are seeing continued strength in some of our merchandise markets. And while truck rates appear to have bottomed, there remains a soft market. Diesel and natural gas prices remain low and benchmark coal prices have moderated. All that said, we grew total volumes and revenue over the quarter as our service-led initiatives continue to bring new business to our railroad. The team has continued to build momentum by working with our customers as we're going to continue to push hard against the mixed economic backdrop. And I'm excited about our upcoming Investor Day, where you will hear more from our commercial leaders who are laying the foundation to deliver profitable growth for CSX. Let's first review our merchandise business, as shown on Slide 7. As a whole, merchandise continues to be a great contributor for us. As we anticipated, volume growth accelerated this quarter, supported by new business wins, truck conversions, and the ramp-up of industrial development projects. Revenue gained 6% compared to last year, driven by a 3% gain in volume and solid pricing. Note that with lower diesel prices, fuel surcharge was a drag on both total revenue and reported RPU. On a core basis, our same-store basis, our merchandise pricing remains solid. Chemicals continued its positive performance for the year, delivering a 9% volume increase year-over-year. We see consistent broad strength across plastics, industrial, industrial chemicals, LPGs and waste. And ag and food, the second half inflection has taken off as we had hoped with volume also up 9%, led by grain and feed ingredients that customers turn to the Midwest for supplies. Close collaboration with our operating team has ensured consistent service as the strong seasonal demand has kicked in. Those products also saw great year-over-year growth with healthy improvement in pulp board demand contributing to a 9% volume gain. Some of this new forest product business is shorter length of haul, which was a factor in 3Q reported RPU. Results in our Minerals business were mixed with volume up 1%. Cement is doing very well, supported by construction demand and the ramp up of new customer facilities, but wet rainy weather was a modest drag on aggregate shipments over the quarter. All that said, the underlying long-term trend remains very favorable. Other markets we serve are facing more near-term challenges. As we've highlighted through much of this year, the metals market, particularly steel, remains soft with sluggish demand, ample supply and low commodity prices. One reason for softer metals demand is a weaker-than-anticipated automotive market where conditions have deteriorated. Volumes inflected negatively for us this quarter and mix was also a modest headwind to auto RPU. As Joe mentioned at an investor conference last month, the industry has seen consumer demand diminish by high retail prices and interest rates which has led to higher dealer inventories and slower production. Our belief is that interest rate easing cycle will help these markets normalize. Lastly, total fertilizer volume continued to trend negatively in the third quarter. So, we were able to pick up some favorable spot moves. For the remainder of the year, we expect to see a carryover of solid year-over-year momentum in chemicals, ag and food, forest products and Minerals, while trains and metals continue to be challenged in the near term. Now let's turn to Slide 8 to review the coal business. For the third quarter, total coal revenue declined 7%, a 2% decline in volume. As shown in our financial report, we saw export and domestic shipments move in opposite directions with export tonnage increasing by 10% year-over-year and domestic tonnage decreasing by 12%. Low natural gas prices continue to limit the utility burn. All-in coal RPU was down 5% compared to last year and 7.5% sequentially, in line with our guidance last quarter and largely driven by the declines in global benchmarks for metallurgical coal. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, market seem relatively stable. Utility stockpiles are sufficient and though natural gas prices recently approach the $3 mark, do not anticipate any near-term step-up in volumes. Export demand remains consistent, particularly from buyers in Asia and the Australian benchmark has stabilized around the $200 level toward the end of the last quarter. Given the lag in our export contracts, we anticipate a modest to low single-digit sequential decline of all-in coal RPU in the fourth quarter. Turning to intermodal on Slide 9. Total revenue declined 2% year-over-year, while volume increased 3%. International shipments grew at a solid mid-single-digit rate, while domestic shipments ended up effectively flat for the quarter. As we talked about in past calls, we did see a shift towards West Coast arrivals over the summer, which lifted our transcontinental interchange businesses to the East. We also opened up new business with several customer partners. Overall, we did see the domestic business gain modest momentum over the quarter but activity with some of our main channel partners remains relatively soft. Total intermodal RPU decreased 5%, largely due to lower fuel surcharge and a mix with international outgrowing the domestic business. We're pleased to see a relatively quick short-term solution for the ILA as we did see the effects on our volumes during the strike. The trucking backdrop has remained challenged through 2024, but we do see signs of market conditions bottoming and are well prepared to handle more volumes as the market continues to improve, and the team continues to find new business for the CSX intermodal network. Summing it up, the team performed very well this quarter, especially given the number of external challenges we faced. Still conditions for the fourth quarter are mixed, with certain markets continuing to show positive momentum while other markets remain challenged, including those markets more impacted by the current interest rate environment. We remain consistent throughout market cycles is our commitment to serving our customers and we remain confident that our creativity will continue to create opportunities next year and well into the future. We look forward to sharing more with you in November. Now I'll turn it over to Sean. Yes. I think there's a couple of factors. Certainly, I think we've been highly successful this year and exceeded our plan coming into the year despite a trucking market that obviously has been more persistently down than what we had thought. So, I think that's probably an opportunity next year. So, it's a watch item, but probably more an opportunity than a risk. Hopefully, as we move through the year. And that's where we're competing today more and more versus that truck. And so that would be a helpful dynamic for us. But overall, we do expect inflation to come down over time, and that would be reflected in some of our price, but we still obviously look for ways to cover our costs and do those things in the right way, but really focus on delivering service. And if we deliver the right service and that service continues to improve, then customers see the value in that and we're able to price to that service. Yes. Well, obviously, the success we've had in merchandise is a very good mix factor for our business. And you'll hear in November that there's a lot of exciting things that we see but within our merchandise markets and what we're doing and the teams that got a lot of great work, but I won't to preempt that today, and we'll share that in November. But when we think about intermodal pricing, there was an intermodal customer of ours that spoke yesterday, and they're certainly closer to the market dynamics on a day-to-day basis than maybe we are. But I think there is some hope that at least we brought them here and at some point next year, we would anticipate some increases because the truckers out there aren't very profitable right now, and they end up having to cover their costs at some point. So, we're seeing probably slower than people expected supply coming out of the market, and that will adjust, and I think that will provide opportunities to convert more volume in the East and hopefully at better rates. And as you know, in many cases, we're tied to that. So, we have some spot market business and others, we follow the price as our customers benefit from that. So, it will be a gradual path forward, but I do think it's probably a better backdrop than what we saw in 2024. Yes. I think -- it's certainly a factor. And I think we've seen announcements, obviously, on the EV side, which is actually -- you'll see this in November, a very small portion of our portfolio, and we've adjusted for that when you see the portfolio. But that is a factor. I mean, with the economics, what the economy is doing at the time will either accelerate or decelerate some of these. But when the shovel is in the ground and the capital is already being put to work, those projects want to obviously go to utilization and get a return. And we're seeing a lot of these projects have shovels in the ground currently. So, we have a lot of visibility that they're going to happen. Could they slip by three months or six months? I think that's possible. We're not -- I don't think we're seeing it in a broad way other than maybe the EV, obviously, announcements that we've seen, but those are 6 to 12 months ago. So yes, I think that's a factor, but I think we feel very, very confident given what we've seen in the capital already spent in a lot of these larger projects for us that those are going to be tailwinds for us. And we'll give you a lot more visibility to that in November. Yes. We certainly compete every day, right? And we have a great service product that's only getting better, and that's obviously been reemphasized by some of the surveys that we do with our customers. So that's certainly a lot easier environment to sell into that than in an environment where your service isn't great. And we experienced that a couple of years ago where we were challenged with obviously head count and some other things. So, nothing's changed from that perspective, and the team is focused on that. We want to deliver value to the customer and the value -- when we're able to do that through service, the customers are willing to pay for it. And we're always looking for ways where we can provide value outside of price, can we cycle their assets and reduce their capital spend and do other things that create efficiencies for our customers. And those are great discussions that we have all the time and probably more so today that with Mike and his team are being very helpful in those conversations. So, there's not a big dramatic change in that. As we go into next year, as I mentioned, the trucking market, Sean touched on this, I think that's helpful. We are successfully converting truck volume in our merchandise franchise, which I can say is probably more than what we've done since I've been in this role. And we've got a momentum around that. What could even inflect that higher is certainly a tighter trucking market where customers aren't seeing savings by doing nothing. When you sit around and you have to do nothing, you're getting savings, you're not as compelled to maybe move some of that freight over to the rail. When that changes, and that environment changes, I think the team is really ready to capitalize on that. So, I think that's -- we're hopefully in the early innings of that. But despite all of those headwinds on the trucking market, we have converted in areas across the board, and you're seeing it in our numbers, forest products in other areas, metals and equipment. We expect some great conversion there over time by the team, and we see those opportunities more and more as we move into next year and the years beyond that. I think at this point, we're safe to call that it feels like the bottoming, certainly, and that gives us hope that we've reached that how -- what the inflection will be and look like. That's a watch item for us. There was talk and pull forward, we're not hearing about that as much, but that's TBD. We expected hopefully a more normalized peak season, but that's a watch item for us, but we're optimistic that, that will occur, and we're planning for that as well. So, we do think the fundamentals don't support a lot of the trucking supply out there, and that's going to rebalance certainly, probably took a lot longer to rebalance given some of the influx of profitability they experienced during the pandemic. And so, they were sitting on a lot more cash to ride this cycle out than maybe previous cycles. Hopefully, I think you'll learn through the earnings calls with the other truckers and others that they're seeing some stability as well. But we're seeing stability, I wouldn't say an inflection at this point. Yes. I mean it was a little bit modest. We did see some shipments naturally move over to the West Coast, and then we would have benefited from that moving from the West to the East, but it was relatively modest. We did see some impact, obviously, with the port shutdown on the East Coast. You saw that for a few days and then I've got to tell you that our operating group on the intermodal side was ready to ramp back up immediately. So very little disruption coming out of it. But those were some lost days that we would expect to recover through the rest of the quarter but it did impact us on a near-term basis. Export coal, my favorite subject. I think when you look at this market over a long period of time, in any cyclical market do you see supply response when the prices are really good and then you obviously see demand response when the macro is not so great globally. What I do think is different going forward is you don't see the supply response like you did in the past. Obviously, the financing and other investments aren't there to bring on new volume into the market. And I think that's a better backdrop for the market we serve and the mines that we serve today in the global competitive environment. So, I'm hopeful that, that creates more price stability longer term. And the other thing is their cost his risen globally as well. And so, I think the natural price for coal is probably going to stabilize above where it is today, and that gives me hope that we'll see better pricing environment going forward. Certainly, what you've seen here recently is a China stimulus, and that's been the talk, right? And they are a big consumer of coal in the global market. And that has given some optimism there that, that could recover. So, it's a global -- we compete in the global market. Our customers compete in the global market, but I do think the supply or the lack of supply response going forward is probably a healthier environment for us and makes me optimistic on our met business, in particular, that we'll see that more stable in the future. Yes. I think there's a lot of factors that obviously play in the RPU length of haul, all those things. I don't see the chemical market really that different from some of our other merchandise markets where we've been successful. So, I know optically maybe on an RPU basis, that appears to be the case. But I think when you look at across that merchandise portfolio, there's really not a big deviation between the markets as our service continues to get better, as I mentioned before, as we deliver, as we can cycle their cars faster and save them capital, all those things factor in and deliver value to the customer in other ways where we can monetize that through price. I don't have any inside look at how that's going, but it certainly will be a watch item for us. I'm hopeful that obviously, the agreement will become well before that and create some -- and eliminate some of the uncertainty that, that could create again for us. When I think about freight and the movement of freight, it naturally wants to move to a certain port and efficiently. And so you've seen the East Coast outperform the West Coast over time. Some of that's because of the manufacturing shift you're seeing, some of that away from China and other parts of the world and more naturally wants the land on the East Coast. I think that continues from everything as you see us trying to decouple from China and those factors, and that's a great thing for us. If you look at the investments that are being made on the East Coast versus the West Coast, I think those are supportive of outgrowth, and we'll participate in that as well. But in many ways, we're somewhat agnostic if again, if freight wants to move in the west and move to the East Coast, that's not a bad thing for us. That would traditionally would truck and so that's an opportunity for us. I do think over time, as we continue to see the East Coast volumes continue to increase, I think we can push more into Chicago and other areas. That's an opportunity, and we'll see that further play out here over time. And then the underline port strategy that we have is going to create a lot of value, and it's going to open up opportunities for our customers look differently at shifting even more freight over to the East Coast because we can efficiently move it in inland with our East Coast ports in a very, very efficient way. So, I don't think we'll get through this noise on the -- obviously, the labor negotiations. But overall, I think the trend continues and we're going to benefit from that as a railroad. Yes. I think -- look, as I mentioned before, we compete every day. We compete knowing that we have very, very good service that continues to improve. And I think the customers have seen that stability in the leadership team that we have though, the consistency of our message and what we're trying to achieve and they understand our objectives, which is to grow with them. I think that's very helpful when you get into those discussions that they understand where we're going and that there's still going to be stability among the leadership team and the team that we've built. So, we continue to have a very, very effective cost base. We can compete when we need to compete both on service and cost. And I think in those cases, we're going to be very, very competitive, and we're going to be winners in that situation. So, we're focused, obviously, on other opportunities, too. We want to grow the pie. We want to grow the market. We want to move the freight that's not moving on rail as well. And I think having those discussions along with retaining our own business is really helpful in retaining that business. So that's where we're focused on right now is growing the pie. And I think we're going to have a lot of success. We've had a lot of success this year, and we're going to continue to have that success as we move into next year and the years beyond that."

            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. I'd like to start by reiterating our appreciation for the tireless work of our fellow railroaders to help friends, communities and the network recover from the devastating impacts of the recent hurricanes. From a business standpoint, Helene impacted revenue by $10 million to $15 million at the end of the third quarter and drove a small amount of incremental expense. It appears the fourth quarter storm-related impacts will be larger than Q3 and with a current estimate of around $50 million. That includes storm recovery and rerouting costs near $20 million as well as roughly $30 million of net revenue impacts. Additionally, a significant rebuild process is already underway for miles of track and multiple bridges across our Blue Ridge subdivision. While we're still evaluating the scale and timing of these capital expenditures, our early read is that rebuild costs will likely exceed a total of $200 million, and the construction will take us into next year. Now to the discussion of the third quarter results. Capitalizing on powerful momentum generated over the last several quarters, the ONE CSX team delivered 7% operating income growth in the quarter, with EPS up double digits. Our proven operating model and increasingly collaborative approach with customers delivered profitable growth at strong incremental margins. In fact, combined merchandise and intermodal revenue, excluding fuel, has grown by at least 3% for seven consecutive quarters, including 5% growth in the most recent quarter. Total revenue increased by 1%, impacted by lower coal revenue as well as declines in fuel recovery, other revenue and trucking. Expense momentum continued as costs were down 2% with more detail to come on the next slide. Interest and other was stable compared to the prior year while income tax expense increased $16 million, with higher pretax earnings, partly offset by a lower effective rate. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total third quarter expense fell by $36 million. While lower fuel prices were a key driver, other costs were up just slightly as efficiency gains and other items mostly offset costs from inflation and 3% volume growth. Turning to the individual line items. Labor and fringe was up $45 million due to inflation and higher total head count. The sequential cost increase from the second quarter was driven by the July 1 union wage increase along with higher incentive compensation. Employment levels have remained stable throughout this year with carload growth of 3% in excess of 2% head count growth in Q3. I would also note about half of the year-over-year head count increase is from quality trucking conversions of outside party drivers to company drivers. Adjusting for this head count would have been up just 1% versus the prior year. Purchased services and other expense decreased by $25 million driven by lower casualty expense and a favorable inventory adjustment in the quarter, with ongoing efficiency gains, mostly offsetting inflation. Depreciation was up $13 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel costs decreased $73 million driven by a lower gallon price and improved efficiency. The operating team delivered our best quarter of fuel efficiency in three years, benefiting from both tactical operating initiatives and increased utilization of fuel-saving technology. Equipment and rents decreased by $3 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $7 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13. Free cash flow continues to be strong at over $2.2 billion. Investing for the safety, reliability and long-term growth of our railroad continues to be our first priority use of capital. After fully funding these investments, we remain committed to our balanced and opportunistic approach to returning cash and have distributed over $1.9 billion to our shareholders year-to-date. Economic profit highlights our priority to grow operating income while maintaining capital discipline and pursuing high-return investments while lower year-to-date economic profit grew in the third quarter. We remain focused on increasing economic profit over the long term and are confident that focus aligns with the interest of our shareholders. With that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Brian, it's Sean. I'll start and then kind of kick it over to Kevin to talk about conversations with the customers. But just when you think about price cost, we've been consistent saying all year long, that spread between dollars of price and cost of inflation has been positive all year long and about as positive as we've seen in the last decade. So, we're not necessarily seeing anything negative in that regard and not seeing a turn in that either so that's very favorable. In terms of kind of the setup in the inflationary environment for next year, wage inflation. We expect north of 4% next year, these tentative agreements, some of which have already been ratified or at 4% midyear next year. We have 4.5%. We just increased here in July. So that will carry forward. That's 4.25% for next year for wages. Health and welfare expenses look like they may actually be lower than that. So, I think wage inflation, including health and welfare will actually be less than 4%. And then inflation across the rest of the book likely to kind of be in line with what you're seeing in terms of overall PPI, maybe call it, 2.5%, 2% to 3%, somewhere in that ballpark. So, it's not like the equation is extraordinarily challenging. And I think -- kick it over to Kevin to talk about conversations and how that's going with the customers. Yes, Jonathan. There are a lot of numbers. So yes, and you got them all right. So, thank you. So, Joe mentioned the revenue headwinds, those are year-over-year in terms of fuel and coal. That probably translates into about $100 million of operating income headwinds year-over-year in Q4. nd then add on that, what we're estimating for now to be roughly $50 million from the hurricane, that's a significant headwind on a year-over-year basis that will make it challenging to grow operating income challenging to grow margins. What that means on a sequential basis is normally, you would see seasonality Q3 to Q4 margins might get a little bit worse. They'll probably be worse than normal seasonality as a result of all the dynamics that we're seeing there including the impact of the storms. In terms of how much worse, I think we're still working through cleanup and recovery, still hoping that we can recover some of the revenue that's been lost and obviously, keeping focused on efficiency efforts. Mike mentioned, even with volume up 3%, we took starts down 3% in the third quarter. So, there's a lot of momentum there. There are some things that we can do to help offset it. But it will certainly be worse than normal seasonality in terms of margins and operating income Q3 to Q4. Yes. And I'd just add on the head count piece there, Scott. We normally -- at least last year, we saw an increase in head count from Q3 to Q4. We'll probably see an increase this year, just very modest. And the reason for that is you've got the train and engine hiring pipeline, what we're hiring for right now essentially is midyear next year, vacation peak so those folks will get marked up and qualified right about the time and attrition gets a little bit higher about that time. But that will be modest, we still expect volume to grow in excess of headcount, especially when you normalize for the quality company driver piece that I talked about. In terms of comp per employee, we normally see a little bit of a step up Q3 to Q4, and that's related to a few different factors. The first is that you start winding up some of your capital programs. So, we have employees that charge more of their time to operating expense at that time of the year, vacations as well. And then I would add on to that, this year, the impacts of the storm driving some higher overtime in the early weeks of the quarter here. So all those factors, I don't think it's going to be significant, but we should see a little bit of an increase in labor per employee. Yes, Christian, thanks for your question. Obviously, for '25 specifically, we're still in the middle of the planning process, so it's a bit early to kind of definitively say anything. But what I would say, broadly speaking, and longer term, we'll highlight this at the investor conference in a few weeks as well is the setup for CSX in terms of where the service product is at how that's impacting the customer experience and the interactions that that's creating, which translate into growth opportunities, not to mention continuing to be able to price at or above inflation is very supportive. The other piece of that, of course, is the fact that the network has capacity. We have locomotives, we have crews. Like Mike mentioned, there are some places we're still hiring. But for the most part, we're only hiring for attrition, we've got line of road capacity. So, you take all that together, it's a good setup for strong incremental margins. There's always things, we can't control that could make it more challenging or easier for us to achieve margin improvement and operating income growth, which, frankly, is the first goal. Operating margin is really sort of the outcome of all of it as we grow into the existing capacity. Fuel prices are down. If you look at where they're expected to be next year, it should be another headwind for us. Export coal prices seem to have stabilized. But if you carry that out to next year, that would be a headwind for us next year. We're going to do a lot of construction on the Howard Street Tunnel next year in Baltimore that will cause some reroutes, some network disruption, not to mention the rebuild coming out of these storms. So, there are some things that will make it a little more challenging. We may see some tailwinds from the trucking market. We're watching that closely and hopeful that the environment there is a little easier next year than it was the previous year. But certainly, longer term, having the capacity to grow and continuing to deliver a consistent high level of service to the customer is a winning equation for us."

            "name": "Mike Cory",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. So, here's a rundown on the operating activities in the quarter. Let me start first, though, by thanking our ONE CSX team for their extremely hard work and their teamwork to deliver solid results through a challenging quarter at times and specifically in certain locations. So, let's go to the first slide on safety. For FRA injuries, not much has changed since the last quarter in terms of metrics. Although we see a higher frequency than our desired target, we're finding the injury severity rate is lower. And as a result, we've seen a reduction in lost days of work for injured employees. For FRA train accidents, we continue to see a year-over-year decrease in incidents. Our biggest improvement has been driven by a reduction in human factor, yard train accidents. Through our safe CSX initiative, we are improving our ability to reduce workplace exposures, and this will continue to drive positive results across the network. We recorded our lowest number of human factor train accidents in September and human factor incidents are our leading cause. And that progress is really great, and it's a great achievement by our employees here at CSX. So looking at the next slide. Our rail road remains fluid, albeit we have had and still have some weather-related challenges. Our overall velocity considering the effects of the weather showed the resiliency of our network. Our ability to maintain our fluidity came directly from the effective response of our field forces and our ops teams and manage changes to our service plan to provide needed service to our customers in an efficient manner throughout this period. Collectively, we're able to ensure our strategy of safe restoration of service was accomplished without injury or accident. And while network speed is extremely important, our focus has been equally strong, ensuring our major engineering work gets accomplished according to the plan. With multiple weather constraints, we were able to stay on plan while maintaining our network velocity. While our dwell metric was affected by weather, we did see an increase of 3% more carloads and moved it with 2% less train starts. So, we continue to manage the inventories in our yards for our customers and always, always look for a more efficient way to move the cars. Whether aside, the team is focused on service and efficiency, and the lessons learned from our response and actions as a team will certainly help in the development of our operating leaders going forward. Over to the last slide, we continue to work with our sales and marketing team to align our operations with the needs of our customers. Excellent service and cost discipline are always at the forefront. Our metrics do reflect weather-related difficulties However, our field forces, as I mentioned earlier, worked extremely efficiently to get us back operating as fast as possible. But the big thing is we did this collectively as a team, with our service group staying close to our customers and communicating important two-way information throughout. Our vast network resilience and faster recovery over our network has allowed us to remain in line with our customers' needs throughout this weather. And I'm very proud of how well the entire team has come together and work to provide service throughout some challenging disruptions. Communication between our service network and field operations team is very strong and continues to strengthen. These last couple of months have provided plenty of opportunities to show what we can do with and for our customers. So, all in all, I'm very proud of the team, and I'm thankful for their efforts in this tough, but very good quarter. Thank you, and over to you, Kevin. Let's start with headcount. First of all, our focus is on retention when it comes to headcount. Overall, we're hiring for attrition, people leaving and it's actually at an escalated rate than what we want. So that's a big focus is to bring that rate down because there's churn in the headcount, people that are here for two years and so and then they leave. Second, we're good in pretty much every location with a couple of locations in the Northeast that we're still hiring for. It's not a big number. But I don't see -- I see our head count getting better for that matter as we get more fluid. You got to remember -- maybe you don't, but in July, we probably had our best operating and customer service metric month throughout the year, and then we got into all these difficulties. So, getting the railway back in shape here over the next few weeks is job number one. The cost that you referred to -- our focus is to continue to deliver the service, but make sure that we're extremely efficient not hung up on anything other than the cost it takes us to get there and what they need. And so I see the cost continuing to be a betterment there, it's just with the disruption to our network. As Sean has mentioned, this next quarter is going to be not where we want to be, but the approach we've taken where we've minimized the amount of starts through all this disruption still handled more volume. I see more of that, yes. No question."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Second Quarter 2024 CSX Corporation Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, JL. Hello, everyone, and good afternoon. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In the presentation accompanying this call, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosures and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. Also, please note that our 10-Q has been filed and is available on our website. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\nJoseph R. Hinrichs: Alright. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter call today. Before we start, I want to acknowledge and appreciate all our CSX employees who are out there working throughout the Southeast United States as we deal with the weather effects from Hurricane Debby. We are prioritizing the safety of our employees and our communities in everything we do. Now, this was a strong quarter for CSX. I am pleased that our results reflect the momentum that we are building as a one CSX team. And I\u2019m proud to see how teams all across our railroad are working together in better and more effective ways than ever before. Operationally, we are developing initiatives to take an excellent scheduled railroading model and make it safer, leaner and more cost effective while providing the consistency and flexibility that our growing customer base demands. And commercially, our sales and marketing organization is creating new, more targeted methods for us to go to market, create partnerships and use our leading value proposition to convert customers onto CSX rail. Now, there is much we have accomplished so far this year and we are eager to maintain and build on our momentum over the rest of the year. We keep reminding the entire ONE CSX team that when we are aligned with each other and work together as one team, there\u2019s really nothing we cannot achieve. Our employees, our customers, and our shareholders are seeing how we are growing the business, controlling costs, leading in customer service, and leveraging our network capacity in ways we never could before. A successful culture we are building at CSX is delivering positive business outcomes. Now, we can go over some of the highlights. Let\u2019s go to Slide 1. On Slide 1, we show that some of the key results from our second quarter compared to revised results from past periods. Later on this call, Sean will provide more detail on the review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor as described in our financial report. Total volume grew by 2% with our intermodal franchise again leading the unit growth of 5% versus last year. And, we are proud to achieve this result even with the constraints at the Port of Baltimore that impacted our coal shipments. Our coal team did an excellent job finding creative ways to respond to the key bridge collapse and deliver for our customers. Our operating margin reached 39.1% which represents a 280 basis point sequential improvement. Revenue adjusted over $3.7 billion was flat compared to the second quarter of 2023 and up modestly over last quarter as strong merchandise pricing and volume growth offset lower coal prices and decline in other revenue. Operating income was 1% lower than last year but up by 8% sequentially as our efficiency efforts helped reduce expense. Our earnings per share were flat versus last year and up by 9% sequentially. Overall, this was a good quarter that was right in-line with our expectations. Had we not faced the incident in Baltimore, our operating income would have been higher year-over-year. Our challenge now is to keep moving forward by focusing on our execution even as markets fluctuate and unexpected events occur as they always do. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike Cory to discuss our operational performance.\nMike Cory: Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Here\u2019s a rundown of our operating activities in the quarter. But before I do that, I\u2019d just like to extend my sincere thanks to the ONE CSX operations team for their effort and their contribution day-in and day-out. We all here truly appreciate everyone\u2019s teamwork and efforts. So, let\u2019s go to Slide 3, the first slide on safety. We saw positive trends on train accidents for the quarter year-over-year. The reduction was driven mainly by fewer mechanical related derailments and a reduction in human failure accidents, although human failure remains our highest causation factor. On injuries, we saw both an increase in transportation and engineering employee incidents. Slips, trips, and falls remain the highest related cause for injury. This is an area where increased attention to risk has tremendous potential to reduce personal injury. Much of our focus is on the development of heightened risk awareness for our less experienced employees who have the highest rate of accident and injury occurrence. By working with our union colleagues, we\u2019re becoming better able to help our employees learn how to identify at risk situations and hazards. Though we have a long way to go, through this collaboration, we believe improvements and safety will take place. We\u2019ve also embarked on an all-inclusive safe operations cultural transformation. This transformation starts with my leadership team and I will extend throughout to every leader at CSX. This three-year initiative is the most extensive safety leadership program we have ever embarked on. We\u2019ll support a culture of risk awareness and care where everyone knows they are valued, appreciated, respected, and included. ONE CSX was the first phase of this effort to align the organization to our values and cultural principles. This next initiative will be an extension of ONE CSX. We\u2019ll have a strong focus on strengthening our safety leadership skills while building engagement with our employees. We\u2019ll be aggressively identifying and eliminating unacceptable risks in our operations, which benefits all our stakeholders. So, going over to the next slide, overall, our fluidity metrics have remained pretty consistent. Our train speed has improved, but we have seen some variability in dwell. Effectively, our dwell metric reflects a combination of our team focusing on keeping cost tightly in-line while maintaining the level of service our customers require. As we\u2019ve deeply dug into train size and local service, we found some cases where we were spending money to switch a customer when the service was not necessarily required. This was reducing the dwell metric, but wasn\u2019t positively impacting the customer experience, and it wasted precious train and engine resources as well as overall costs. We\u2019re eliminating these unproductive handlings even though in some cases it will result in higher overall dwell. On the flip side, we\u2019re spending a considerable amount of time evaluating our network infrastructure to identify opportunities that will increase the efficiency of certain yards and reduce the dwell going forward. These evaluation exercises start by analyzing the present level of production against demand, ensuring proper standards are in place and that those standards are being met. Then we aim to increase workload and reduce both handling at other locations and a reduction of route miles when possible. This can entail simple self-funded improvements in the infrastructure at some of our switching yards to eliminate car handlings and route miles. Effectively, we\u2019re creating more mass where it makes sense, resulting in improved asset speed, service, and reliability. As we identify physical improvements to the infrastructure, we work with our supervisors to lead that process, so they understand how to extract the intended value and more. This experience teaches them to continue to strive for both productive work and opportunities for service or growth potential. This initial exercise has been also been supported by a reduction in cost through better utilization of our major engineering gangs as well. Through all these exercises, supervisors are the largest area of a focus for us as we continue to develop the bench strength on CSX and position them to understand their overall operations better. And, we\u2019re supporting them through a variety of methods, which include increasing visibility of leading indicators. We\u2019re teaching them then how to utilize that data to identify areas improvement and the overall cost of their operations, and they get a lot of daily engagement with the senior leadership team. A great greater focus is to ensure they gain a far deeper understanding of the overall operational and customer activities within their charge. We expect to continue improving these metrics as we go forward. Through the actions of our supervisors, we will always weigh customer need and the cost required to do so. Overall, I\u2019m satisfied we\u2019re on the right trajectory. We have opportunities and plans in sight for our network infrastructure and as well our operations leaders\u2019 ability to improve. Turning over to the next slide, we continue to work with Kevin and the sales and marketing team to align our operations with the needs of our customers. Preferred service and cost discipline are always at the forefront. We strive to understand exactly how our customers work and what they need from us. Having this information in the hand of field level supervisors and stressing connectivity with their customers allows us to provide a very high-level of first and last mile service. Our Trip Plan performance, like the dwell metric, reflects the same effect from a continuous focus on cost and customer need. We\u2019ve identified areas of opportunity to improve or rely on more specific first mile and last mile metrics along with customer feedback and engagement to ensure we are delivering the needed service. You can see in our CSD numbers that our strong customer engagement and level of service are taking place. In closing, we have much work to do as we always will. With that said, I\u2019m really excited now that our operations leadership team has been together for close to six months. I can see the improvement being made to clarify the importance of our tasks and to increase our information visibility. I can also see the deep thirst for learning from all our supervisors at all levels. And this, to me, is probably the most important factor going forward. This team fully believes our approach to a safe, balanced, and efficient customer focused railroad as many opportunities for improvement ahead, and our plan is to deliver on every one of them. With that, over to you, Kevin.\nKevin Boone: Thank you, Mike. As Joe referenced, we are really seeing a lot of positive momentum, particularly around sales and marketing collaborating with operations. Highlighting these initiatives are the market reviews where our teams come together to discuss and evaluate opportunities to collaborate on operational efficiencies while delivering new solutions to target profitable business. Driving network efficiencies allows us to deliver a more competitive service product and expand the opportunity for growth. We are continuing to be very aggressive in pushing forward on our truck conversions, new industrial development projects, and creative solutions with the growing number of shippers who want to maximize their use of CSX rail. As you\u2019ve heard from a number of our peers and competitors across the transportation industry over these past weeks, the trucking market remains challenged and industrial markets are mixed as we move into the second half of the year. Accumulating effects of interest rates including a sluggish housing market and fluctuating commodity prices creates headwinds for some of the markets we serve. It\u2019s a volatile environment, but we continue to drive initiatives to accelerate modal share and expand CSX\u2019s addressable market. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 7, and look at our merchandise performance. We had a great result with revenues up 5% on a 1% increase in volume. RPU was higher by 4% even with fuel surcharge lower year-over-year. As we continue to get pricing results that reflect the strong service that the team is delivering. Throughout the second quarter, our chemicals franchise has performed very well as momentum has persisted in plastics, industrial chemicals, waste, and energy markets. Minerals revenues also saw positive results driven by industrial development wins and our unique network access into the southeast markets including Florida where we see a multi-year glide path for growth. Our Forest Products business began to accelerate driven by demand in pulp board and recent wins in the northeast portion of our network. We\u2019ve been developing some very promising strategic partnerships in this market to take advantage of the capacity that our network has available, which puts us in a good position to gain more truck share as the housing market rebounds. Our Automotive business saw 4% revenue growth, leveraging our strong service product to deliver a competitive win with a key customer. Less favorable this quarter was metals, where high inventories and expectations of weaker steel prices weighed on volumes. This is probably the market with the most near-term uncertainty as we watch trends in coil, plate, and scrap prices for a recovery. Fertilizer volumes continue to be hurt by phosphate production issues here in Florida. As in past quarters, lower volumes of this short haul of business, does have a favorable mix effect on the total fertilizer RPU. And Ag and Food remains soft on unfavorable regional crop supply dynamics. So, we are very encouraged by the fundamentals into the back half of the year where we see a weaker southeastern crop leading to incremental opportunities for growth. For the remainder of the year, despite a sluggish economy and persistently weak trucking market, we expect to capitalize on our best-in-class service to deliver growth. Chemicals should remain strong supported by business wins, steady plastics and healthy waste moves. We also see opportunities in our Forest Product segment where we see operational focus differentiating us in the market. We\u2019re also anticipating a much better second half for our Ag and Food business with demand supported by larger hog and chicken herds in the Southeast, which will need feed grain supplies from the Midwest. Turning to Slide 8 in the coal business. First, I want to reiterate Joe\u2019s comments from the beginning of the call. Our team in Baltimore did a fantastic job of finding creative solutions to move coal after the Key Bridge collapse. Their efforts made a huge difference in reducing the negative impact that this incident had on CSX and the customers we serve. As we highlighted at a conference earlier this spring, operations at Curtis Bay were up and running at the end of May, several weeks ahead of our original projections. For the quarter, revenues were down 12%. We estimate that without the Key Bridge collapse, the year-over-year decline would have been more in the range of 5%. Volume was down only 3% with the decline driven by domestic shipments largely to utilities. Key here is that our team was able to grow export volume by 8% year-over-year which is an extraordinary result given the closure of the Port of Baltimore. Our PE was 9% lower year-over-year and 6% lower sequentially in-line with our expectations and driven by export benchmark prices and unfavorable utility mix. Looking ahead, the key benchmark for high-quality Australian coal remains above $200 per metric ton. Given the lag in our export coal contracts, we expect a mid-to-high single-digit sequential decline for all in coal RPU in the third quarter. The temporary idling of a recently opened export mine on our network should have little impact on our export volumes as we see strong production offsets at other CSX served mines. Just as we did this last quarter, the team is already finding some creative ways to pivot towards other opportunities in the marketplace where we see strong demand for export capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal. On the domestic side, low natural gas prices continue to impact volumes, but we\u2019ve seen some good signs from the hot summer with several utilities in our service region maximizing their coal units in response to very strong demand. We\u2019ve also seen inventory levels moderate from the highs seen earlier in the year. Finally turning to Intermodal on Slide 9, revenue increased 3% on 5% volume growth. RPU declined 2% as we felt the effects of lower fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix. Our International business drove our volume growth this quarter supported by higher East Coast import activity and favorable alignment with our steamship line partners. This has been the trend through the year and we\u2019ve been pleased to see customer activity remain solid so far in the Q3. In contrast, momentum in our domestic intermodal business remains muted as weak trucking conditions persist. The weak trucking market has continued much longer than what was expected coming into the year, but in the meantime, we\u2019ll keep pushing hard in a tough environment, leading with our best-in-class service. All-in, the collective team has been capitalizing on opportunities throughout the year, working together to win business and gain share for CSX. With mixed conditions across end markets, we\u2019ve been able to grow total volume by 3% year-to-date while setting ourselves up for more profitable growth over the longer-term by demonstrating to our customers that CSX stands apart for our service, creativity, efficiency, and capacity. Now, let me turn it over to, Sean.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Mike and the operations team continue to drive efficiency with strong service, we\u2019re challenging ourselves to hold support costs in-line and grow revenue through pricing gains and new business wins. As Joe noted, we\u2019ve built momentum over the last several quarters and we\u2019re looking ahead to strong year-over-year growth in the second half of the year, as we finally cycle some of the discrete items that helped our results in prior years. Revenue was flat in the Q2 while operating income was down 1% when compared to revised prior year results. Merchandise and Intermodal revenue ex fuel was up 5% and was partially offset by about a $100 million of unfavorable impacts related to lower export coal benchmark pricing and the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. Declines in other revenue, fuel recovery, and trucking drove an additional revenue headwind of nearly $60 million. Expenses were 1% higher, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $11 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell by $8 million. As a result, earnings per share was up 9% sequentially and stable year-over-year at $0.49. Let\u2019s now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. As noted in the quarterly financial report, our review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor drove immaterial adjustments to previously reported financial statements. Second quarter 2023 expense was revised up by $16 million and going forward we expect a similar quarterly expense impact split between labor and PS&O. The labor portion will result in lower capital expenditures, and the adjustments for engineering scrap and labor did not impact cash flow. Total second quarter expense increased by $20 million. Turning to the individual line items, labor and fringe was up $18 million as costs from increased headcount and inflation were partly offset by lower incentive compensation and other items. Headcount declined slightly from the first quarter and is expected to remain relatively stable through the remainder of the year. We expect to deliver labor efficiency gains in the second half while continuing to ensure the training pipeline is stable to offset attrition and support future growth. Also, as a reminder, our union employees are receiving a 4.5% wage increase effective on July 1st, and that will be reflected in a higher sequential cost per employee. Purchase services and other expense increased $8 million as broad based efficiency savings and a favorable insurance recovery, mostly offset cost from inflation, a write-off of inventory in the quarter and other items. Depreciation was up $6 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $11 million driven by a lower gallon price and improved efficiency, partly offset by costs related to higher volume. Through a combination of operating initiatives and effectively leveraging fuel saving technologies, we matched our best quarter of fuel efficiency over the last three calendar years. Finally, equipment and rents decreased by $5 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $4 million. Now, turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13, free cash flow year to-date is $1.15 billion. This reflects lower net earnings and deferred tax payments made this year, partially offset by the prior year impact of back wage payouts. As expected, capital expenditures are also higher year-over-year as we continue to prioritize investments for the safety, reliability, and long-term growth of our railroad. After fully funding these investments, we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date, and we remain committed to our balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. A long-term focus on economic profit further aligns our interest with our shareholders. While economic profit is lower year-to-date as we cycle prior year comparisons, the team is strategically focused on growing this measure over time. We expect second half economic profit to be up versus the prior year as profitable growth is paired with disciplined asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital investments. With that, let me turn it back to Joe, for his closing remarks.\nJoseph R. Hinrichs: Alright. Thank you, Sean. Now, we will wind up our prepared remarks by reviewing our guidance for the full year 2024. If you look at Slide 16, we expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single digit range for the second half of the year. Total first half revenue was slightly below our original expectations, largely due to lower fuel prices. The macroeconomic environment does appear a little more uncertain than it did a few months ago. That said, as Kevin described, in merchandise, we see promise across chemicals, forest products, ag and food, and minerals markets supported by increasing customer activity, the ramp up of new projects, and a growing portfolio of business wins. On the other hand, metals and fertilizers have both lagged and appear likely to remain softer through the end of the year. We expect momentum to gradually build in Intermodal supported by strong port activity and the strength of our service performance, which is facilitating new ways of working together with our channel partners. This is allowing us to drive small but meaningful modal conversions even while the truck market still remains soft. The reopening of the Port of Baltimore, return to full operations at Curtis Bay and consistent domestic demand should lead to a modest pickup in coal shipments in the second half of the year. We continue to price according to our leading service, work better together as a ONE CSX team and push forward on our efficiency initiatives. As a result, we expect to deliver a meaningful operating margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in the second half, supported by a very strong incremental margin on our revenues. Our CapEx forecast of approximately $2.5 billion is unchanged as is our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns. We are encouraged by our accomplishments over the first half of the year. Now, we are very focused on executing our plan over the rest of 2024 as we position ourselves for sustained, profitable growth over the long-term. We have the capacity, the operating model, leadership team and the culture we need to ensure that we are the best run railroad in North America. We look forward to sharing more details about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day in November. Thanks for your interest in our company. Matthew, we\u2019re ready to take questions.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has the opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. JL, we\u2019re ready to start the process.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Ossenbeck of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. So, maybe with Kevin, just wanted to see if you\u2019re feeling any impact or seeing any impact from the potential, East and Gulf Coast labor disruption? Doesn\u2019t sound like that\u2019s the case, but wanted to see if there\u2019s anything in particular that you\u2019re hearing from customers. And, maybe to that point, we\u2019ve seen a lot of international volume. You gave the reasons for that, but when do you think some of that would start to spill over into the domestic side?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I guess that\u2019s a magic question, right? When does the domestic market recover, given what we\u2019ve seen on the export or the import side of the business. I think, I don\u2019t we\u2019re still not hearing from customers a major shift, in their activity from the east to the west. If that were to occur, I think it probably presents maybe more opportunities than risk for our business, especially if some things want to move further into the eastern part of our network where today that\u2019s truck. So, it\u2019s a watch item for us. We\u2019ll be close with Mike and his team and able to capitalize on that if we see a shift, which this team is well prepared to capitalize on. Yes, we all listen to the earnings calls from our customers on the domestic side, and I think, we all came into the year a little bit more optimistic on the recovery. It will come, but it\u2019s been pushed to the right. That\u2019s for sure. And, I think, hopefully, the import business will be a precursor to, some better days ahead on the domestic side, but we\u2019re not yet seeing that uplift necessarily as you\u2019ve heard from a lot of our customers, on their earnings calls.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So, Sean, the comments about meaningful margin improvement in the back half, any just directional color what that means? And, I know every quarter you give us some thoughts on sort of the sequential puts and takes for margins and earnings, two good quarters in a row with cost ex fuel coming down? Do you think that continues, stuff like that? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Sure, Scott. Yes. I mean, I we\u2019re not going to give a pinpoint estimate on meaningful improvement in margins or we would have done that, obviously. But, we feel good about the setup for the second half of the year, and I think what\u2019s exciting is some of the sort of dust that\u2019s been in the year in terms of year-over-year comparison starts to clear in the second half of the year, and you\u2019ll see the core momentum that we continue to build both on the cost side, but also, the pricing action, supportive of the service reflective of the service that we\u2019re delivering as well as the growth that we\u2019re seeing in the business. That\u2019ll drop through at very attractive incremental margins. Sequentially, second to the third quarter, you got a couple things going on that are probably worth remembering. One is Kevin\u2019s guidance on the coal RPU, which will be down mid to high-single digits. That\u2019ll be a big impact. We got the wage step up. For us, that\u2019ll be about 20 million. Fuel, we have positive lag in the second quarter. So, depending on where prices go, that could be a headwind as well. That said, we\u2019re holding the line on expenses. The things that we can control, obviously, we can\u2019t control the wage increase or fuel prices. But outside of that, we feel good about, the run rate that we\u2019re at in terms of second quarter for core expenses. And, our focus is on, growing year-over-year and delivering that growth at strong incrementals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Chappell of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJonathan Chappell: Thank you. Kevin and maybe looping Mike in here as well. Back on the opportunities, I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around what could happen with the port. There\u2019s probably a perception that the East Coast rails are hit more directly. But as you mentioned, there\u2019s probably more kind of long haul as it relates to intermodal, etcetera. Can you just tell us how you think about the opportunities and risks of this as it gets closer and what it does to the network as far as keeping balance and resources that are required if there were to be a stoppage and you did have to kind of shift more to a Chicago focus as opposed to, some of the East Coast ports?\nKevin Boone: Yeah. I\u2019ll let Mike, follow-up. But from a capacity standpoint, we\u2019re working really close, with our team. I think we\u2019re well-positioned to adjust as we have in the past, when these events happen, temporarily. But, like you mentioned, there\u2019s opportunities probably for some longer haul, business should, we see a disruption on the East Coast and some more volumes that would traditionally move east local. Think about the New York markets and maybe some of the southeastern markets that are locally trucked, that would have to move through the West Coast. That that\u2019s an opportunity for all of us to participate, and we\u2019ll be more than ready to do that. But I\u2019ll hand it over to, Mike to talk about capacity.\nMike Cory: Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Hi, Jon. What\u2019s the capacity, Jon? We have the odd train, train pair, let\u2019s say, that\u2019s, at a higher rate of using capacity. But for the most part, our network can withstand whatever Kevin brings us in terms of intermodal. We\u2019ve done a lot of work at our terminals. Our intermodal team is really dug in deep here over the last six, eight months to provide that great first and the last mile for the customer. But in terms of the capacity over the network, it\u2019s there for us to get, get the business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nChris Wetherbee: Yes. Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I guess real quick, I don\u2019t know if you gave it. I apologize if I missed it. Could you give us the number of the accounting change for the quarter, the impact on 2Q? And, then I guess I was curious about, how you think about pricing sort of going forward? As you see, service product continue to be very solid. There\u2019s some opportunities on the volume side. I know you do most of the re-pricing probably towards year-end. Are you seeing any of that acceleration in terms of the year-over-year growth that you\u2019re able to capture on new contracts as they be as they are being signed to through 2Q and into 3Q?\nSean Pelkey: Chris, it\u2019s Sean. I\u2019ll take the restatement first. So, what I mentioned was a $16 million impact in the prior year split between labor and PS&O. Even though there was no restatement for Q2, obviously, because we\u2019re reporting Q2 results of this year for the first time, that impact was similar in the second quarter, and that\u2019s pretty similar to what we expect on a go-forward basis as well. I\u2019ll turn it over to Kevin for pricing.\nKevin Boone: Yes. On the second question, clearly, facing a truck market when you\u2019re trying to convert truck is not the most ideal backdrop to do that, but we\u2019ve had a lot of success. And, you\u2019re going to see that success really build momentum as that market comes back. So, and on the intermodal side, not as strong of a pricing environment, which we\u2019ve been pretty transparent about. On the merchandise side, given our service, given the value we\u2019re providing to customers, given the efficiency we\u2019re driving for them, we\u2019re having really good discussions around there. And, you\u2019re right. A lot of that re-pricing every year comes out at the end of the year in the first part of next year. But, with inflation coming down, those things, those will be factors as well, but we still nothing\u2019s really changed from our strategy there. We want to go after volume and price, and deliver the value to our customers so they are, see the value in, giving us more business along with, obviously covering the cost and the inflation that we will have to absorb every year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz of UBS. Your line is open.\nTom Wadewitz: Yes. Good afternoon. Wanted to see, Mike, if you could offer some thoughts on how you think the network is running? I think some of the metrics show a little bit of deterioration in terms of, like, on time arrivals or carload trip plan compliance. I wonder if you think, why you think that would be the case and whether you would expect those metrics to rebound as you look into 3Q and 4Q?\nMike Cory: Sure. Thanks for the question, Tom. Look, we have really made a lot of changes here the last six months, most focused on two things. Well, safety first, as though you can\u2019t tell by our metrics on that. But service, whatever we do in terms of whether it\u2019s we make changes to the operating plan, which in some cases has caused trains not to run on time right down to making sure that the assets that we have out there are being pushed. So, locomotives being stored. We\u2019re doing things right now just to test the railway. And, yes, there\u2019s been some drop in some of the metrics, and, yes, they will improve, as we go forward. But, we have opportunities here, first of all, with a very young group of people to learn how to do this properly, and second, for them to partake in it. So, the changes we\u2019re making, yes, they\u2019re having some effect, nothing material, but some effect on some of our lagging indicators. But, what we\u2019re able to do from a cost perspective and still maintain that service is powerful. And, really by focusing on the connectivity between our fields people and their customers, we\u2019re starting to see the more benefits come out. So, yes, we\u2019ll get our metrics back, but at the same time, we\u2019re not running for a metric. We\u2019re running for service. We\u2019re running for a return, and that\u2019s very important. And so, Tom, for me just learning as I go. I\u2019ve been here 10 months now. I\u2019m not overly concerned. Trust me. It\u2019s a focus, as we go through to improve those metrics. And, prior to this storm we had going, we had a pretty good, pretty good July, on those regards. So, metrics will improve, but focus is on cost and service and safety. And, we\u2019ll figure out the right metrics from there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ben Nolan of Stifel. Your line is open.\nBen Nolan: Yes. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. I was going to ask a little bit on the chemical side. That has been working pretty well for you guys. It was curious how you would, do you think it\u2019s just fundamentally there\u2019s just a lot more chemicals to be moved, or is this share gains maybe relative to the trucking side of the business or maybe competitors? And, any framing that you can, talk to on the chemical side would be helpful.\nJoseph R. Hinrichs: Yes. I mean, I think you first got to start with last year. Obviously, that was a difficult backdrop for our chemical market, but we have seen some wins on the industrial, development side, that are really starting to, help us there. So, that\u2019s been positive in the plastics market, so we\u2019ve really capitalized on those opportunities. And, I think it\u2019s all of the above that you mentioned. We obviously have quality carriers and, that alignment with them, that understanding of the market has helped us in our conversations with customers. In fact, there\u2019s a recent customer where we\u2019re kind of bundling that opportunity together and allows us for us to work together in a white boarding session to really look at their total network and how we can make that real more rail centric over time. So, those are exciting things. Some of the things that we\u2019ve been working on for a long time that are really, picking up momentum, but it\u2019s really all of the above. It starts with the leading service in the in the east, and we\u2019re really, delivering on that, and that allows us to have a really different conversation with our customers than we were able to a year or two ago.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Morgan of Barclays. Your line is open.\nEric Morgan: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask on Industrial Development. Just wondering if you could offer any update on some of those projects. I don\u2019t think the merchandise slide called out the, that 1% contribution to merchandise volumes you called out last quarter. So, just wondering if that\u2019s still the target. And then, curious just any other progress you\u2019ve made since last quarter, anything incremental that might have you tracking closer to the low or high-end of that 1% to 2% range you\u2019ve talked about for, I think \u201825 or \u201926?\nKevin Boone: Yes. I mean, Joe mentioned at Investor Day in November, and we\u2019re certainly going to put probably more of a bow on the story and, kind of open up, a lot more of the details and share with all of you. But, we are seeing that acceleration, this year, year-over-year, in that range that I mentioned. And, when you look at full run rate and some of these projects can take a year or two to really get up to full run rate volume, But, the pickup in terms of things that we\u2019re seeing put in place this year has certainly accelerated this year, and we anticipate that\u2019ll accelerate next year and then the following year. So, that means, several years of growth as those projects really come up to full rate production. On average, a lot of these projects are $2 million. So, it\u2019s a lot of small things that add up to a fairly large number. We do have the larger projects in there as well, but it\u2019s a very diverse, set of projects, opportunities that are that are coming online across a number of our merchandise network segments. So it\u2019s exciting. We still see the momentum out there. I think, it\u2019s going to be fun to talk about it in November and, and share more of those details with you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nKen Hoexter: Hey, great. Good afternoon. Sean, can you just, I guess, can you clarify when you say, meaningful improvement, in answering Scott\u2019s question, but you didn\u2019t say if you were going to see sequential improvement or decline. I just want to clarify if you were suggesting you\u2019re going to see improvement sequentially. And then when you mentioned labor flattish, do you still see opportunities to cut costs there, or can we see progress on that, or is this kind of the refined level you expect to run at? Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. Ken, I\u2019ll take the sequential part first. We\u2019re not going to guide specifically to sequential. I did lay out a couple of the factors there that are be somewhat, challenging from 2Q to 3Q, comes with a wage step up, the net fuel, and the coal RPU. That being said, core expenses, we should trend pretty similarly to Q2. And, we\u2019ll see what happens in terms of the demand side of the equation. But, again, feel good about low to mid-single digit volume and revenue growth year-over-year in the second half. And then, in terms of the labor opportunities, I think there\u2019s always, continued opportunities to drive efficiencies on labor. Mike\u2019s clearly focused on overtime reductions out there. We\u2019re seeing momentum across many of the crafts. He\u2019s also got a team looking very closely at how do we increase retention across the craft workforce T&E in particular. There\u2019s significant cost in training those employees, and retention is extraordinarily important, not just from an operating, standpoint, but also from a cost and efficiency standpoint. So, definitely opportunities going forward on the labor side even if it\u2019s not headcount. I think headcount will be pretty stable, and we will drive year-over-year improvements in headcount efficiencies where we do expect volume to grow more than headcount in the second half.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Imbro of Stephens. Your line is open.\nBrady Lierz: Okay, great. Thanks. This is Brady on for Daniel. I wanted to ask, as we\u2019ve gone through earnings season, we\u2019ve heard some anecdotes about the truck market maybe moving a little closer to balance than it has been over the last couple of years and maybe even showing some signs of seasonality again. I wanted to ask, have you seen or heard any anecdotes from customers to suggest truck to rail conversions are picking up sequentially or could pick up in the back half? Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: Yes. I listened to the same call as you did. I think they\u2019re obviously a lot closer to it, on a day to day basis, than we are. I think the environment\u2019s persisted a lot longer, than what we expected than everyone expected, quite frankly, and we\u2019re just, setting ourselves up for the recovery, and I think we\u2019re well positioned there. But I don\u2019t have any additional anecdotes to add to what we\u2019ve all heard. I\u2019m hopeful that, we\u2019re further along in this cycle than not. And I think we\u2019re set up, with what Mike mentioned on our intermodal ops side from a capacity standpoint, we\u2019re better positioned than we ever have to bring on the volume.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Seidl of TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJason Seidl: Thank you, operator. Joe, Kevin, Mike, Sean, good afternoon, gentlemen. Wanted to dig a little bit deeper, Joe, into a comment you made. You talked about it now. There appears to be, I guess, a little bit more uncertainty a quarter ago. Was that comment more related to what we\u2019ve seen sort of over the past two weeks with, PMI being negative again and the job number that we saw last week? Or was this from what your customers might be telling you? And if it is from the customers, maybe you could elaborate or just give us more color on that.\nSean Pelkey: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. I think Kevin has highlighted a number of the areas. One area we didn\u2019t talk about was automotive. And while we had strong performance in the first half of the year, I think you\u2019ve seen the shipments over the last few weeks have been down a little bit coming out of their shutdown period. So, that\u2019s one we watch very carefully from the consumer side of things, interest rate sensitivity. You think about it, housing market, auto market are two big areas in our business that are very rate sensitive, so we\u2019re watching it very carefully. But my comment was, you know so that\u2019s in addition to all the stuff that Kevin talked about earlier. But my comment was more in general, I think. I mean we were thinking about this call. This is even before today\u2019s events, when the marketplace, I think there\u2019s just a little more uncertainty about where the economy really is. We see a number of areas that we\u2019re excited about for the second half of the year. But clearly, we\u2019re watching what happens with the Fed. We\u2019re watching what happens in the general economy. And, and so I think if you could say where we are today versus two months ago, the economy seems to be a little bit more fragile. And we\u2019re optimistic that, you know, it can pick itself up, but we\u2019re watching it very carefully.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephanie Moore of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephanie Moore: Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Maybe continuing on the same thing, would love to hear maybe some color that you\u2019re seeing from maybe some picked up infrastructure or general industrial investments that we\u2019ve seen across the southeast. Any commentary that would suggest maybe a slowdown in that activity or acceleration or the likes there, or any kind of thoughts as we kind of look forward? Thank you.\nJoseph R. Hinrichs: Not really any, slowdown. And I think we presented a slide last time that we do have a very, very diverse portfolio and there was a lot of focus on the EV market and certainly we\u2019ve seen some of that be pushed to the right, but our portfolio is much, much larger than, just the EV segment. So other areas, continue to stay on trend, on pace, and we\u2019ll, obviously have a ramp up period over time. But we have we have pretty clear line of sight. A lot of construction is already underway. So, a lot of some capital out there with these projects needing to be finished. So, we feel pretty good that despite maybe, even if the macro scene is a little bit weaker in the back half that these projects, in large part will continue on and be a positive factor for us in the back half and into the next year and the following year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin of RBC Capital. Your line is open.\nWalter Spracklin: Yes, thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. I was wondering, I don\u2019t know if this is a question more for Mike or for Sean with regard to long-term OR where your OR could go. I know that you and a number of your peers were able to achieve a 55 OR at least on a quarterly basis, in the past. But now with cost inflation, new work rules and I\u2019m talking really just your rail operation if we would exclude your trucking from this conversation. If we look at the cost inflation, new work rules and the other factors that have come to play here in the current environment, do you still see your efforts and Mike you mentioned you\u2019re making great efforts on cost efficiency, on service and on safety. Can they translate into 55 again? Or is 60 the new 55 or something else? And maybe if you talk a little bit conceptually about not so much the target itself, but if these are real impediments to you achieving the run rates you\u2019ve had in the past.\nMike Cory: Well, I\u2019ll start it off, Walter, and nice to hear you. Good that you\u2019re on the call. Look, no different than any other time. The margin is not what we\u2019re aiming for. We do see a pipeline in terms of efficiencies, and that\u2019s again, this is going to take time, but it\u2019s happening as we speak that we\u2019re developing supervisors to see these things, giving them the tools to be able to relate to them better. And I see a lot of the things I saw in my previous career. There\u2019s just opportunity here to connect people and activities where we get rid of waste. And that\u2019s our focus, and I\u2019ll turn it over to my financial friend here.\nSean Pelkey: No. Thanks, Mike. I agree. I mean, margin obviously is an indicator of financial health and in our industry, it helps us to understand how efficient we\u2019re running the railroad. Clearly, as we\u2019re able to grow the business as well and do that at strong incrementals that\u2019s going to help the margin, but the margin really isn\u2019t the destination. The goal is to grow earnings, to grow economic profit, be disciplined around the way that we spend capital and look for opportunities to invest in things that have a high return, whether those are growth oriented projects or projects that help us to drive further efficiency gains, technology investments, capacity investments across the railroad. That\u2019s our primary focus. We think that\u2019s the quickest, surest way, to grow the value of the company. And in terms of things changing versus previously, I think you make a good point in terms of the impact of inflation on the rail operating ratio, operating margin equation. That being said, I don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t continue to see improvement in that metric as we expect across many other metrics, in our financial performance over time if the formula, the equation that we have going for us right now is able to continue, and we\u2019ve got confidence that we\u2019ll be able to do that.\nJoseph R. Hinrichs: Yes. This is Joe. Last comment to add to that. I appreciate you recognizing, quality carriers as part of our equation when it comes to margins. If you look at our second quarter performance, even with now accounting for scrap and the related labor according to our policies, even looking at fuel being down, we had over 39% margin in our corporate results. But if you look at the as we\u2019ve said in the past, effective quality carriers is about a 250 basis point effect on our total margin. So, our rail operations, then if you just do that simple math, had over a 41% margin in the second quarter. In a clean quarter with not a lot of exceptional things going on or, like, a lot of those quarters that you\u2019re referencing in the past had high fuel surcharge or had a lot of demurrage or storage charges or even had record export coal prices and other things like that. We had a pretty stable quarter even with the Baltimore bridge collapse. And with our rail operations, even with the inflation that we\u2019ve had over the last couple of years, capable of delivering that kind of performance. And as we\u2019ve noted optimistic about how we continue to run this as forward, we\u2019re very excited about the margin potential of this business, and recognizing that service and our operating efficiency go hand in hand. Having said all of that, if the pursuit is just only to optimize the margin number, this industry or even this company has the potential to turn away good business. And I think it has in the past. If we had a 41% plus operating margin for our rail business last quarter and a 35% margin opportunity present itself, do we turn it down? And where our cost of capital is a lot lower than that, and most businesses don\u2019t have that kind of margin. It would deteriorate the average margin on the business, but still incrementally could be good business. And so that\u2019s where Sean\u2019s point, is very valid. We want to grow earnings, grow cash so we can return that to shareholders and reinvest in the business for profitable growth. And that\u2019s the kind of way we look at it. Efficiency matters. There\u2019s no question about it. So does safety, so does service. But the big opportunity at these margins is to create profitable growth, which has strong incremental more incremental margins. That\u2019s what we\u2019re excited about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Sean, I wanted to ask the incremental sort of operating leverage question a little bit differently. If you look at the first half of the year, volumes are up 2%, operating profit is down 4%. I know the bridge is in there, but if you think about what\u2019s been missing in the equation for operating leverage to drop down to the bottom line on that volume, what what\u2019s going to change in the second half of the year?\nSean Pelkey: Yes. No. Good question, David. If you look at the first half, I mean, I get to about $300 million of kind of unique year-over-year challenges between the Baltimore collapse, the lower export coal pricing, decline in other revenue, net fuel, that\u2019s $300 million. Second half is not going to be anywhere near that significant. We will have coal pricing headwinds, but the rest is pretty clean. And then the other thing that\u2019s different, in the first half of the year, we were still cycling, some of the labor additions that that came on over the course of last year. So, our labor productivity was negative in the first half of the year. That\u2019s going to turn positive in the second half of the year, on our volume growth and, keeping headcount essentially flat from where we are right now. So, those are the two big factors there.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ravi Shanker of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, everyone. So maybe also piggybacking on that operating leverage question. I mean, just to kind of summarize the call a little bit, and it seems like a little bit of a mixed message from you guys on cycle sentiment. On the one hand, you did say that the it appears the kind of inflection is kind of pushed out a little bit and the economy is a little more fragile. On the other hand, you are guiding to some pretty strong operating leverage in the back half of the year. Just trying to get a sense of how much visibility you have on that operating leverage because general, in comments you indicated that\u2019s driven a lot by volume and price. And in a fragile market that maybe a little hard to come by, especially given some of the puts and takes in the end market there. Just trying to get a sense of how much confidence and visibility you have on that operating leverage in the back half.\nSean Pelkey: There\u2019s been a lot of puts and takes, this is Sean, on a year-to-date basis, but, we\u2019re pretty much right on our plan in terms of both total volume and revenue, which is which is great. We had a stretch plan in place, across the teams, and we\u2019ve done a good job when there have been challenges of figuring out ways to offset them. Kevin did a good job of describing that with the key bridge outage in in Baltimore and what we did to adjust there. And we think we\u2019ll be able to continue to do that as the year goes forward. And I think I think we also talked about a number of the opportunities. There are some markets that are setting up quite well for us in the second half of the year. It\u2019s not guaranteed until we actually move the freight, but we\u2019ve got a couple areas of strength between ag and food and minerals and chemicals continuing to show nice year-over-year growth. There\u2019s some headwinds and some uncertainties out there as well. So, nothing\u2019s ever a given, but we\u2019re not only focused on growing the volumes. We\u2019re also focused on getting the price that we need to get in the marketplace. A lot of that price for this year has already been locked in, and then driving efficiency in the cost base. And we\u2019ve already seen pretty significant improvements from where we entered the year to where we\u2019re exiting the first half of the year that give us confidence we\u2019ll be able to hold the line there into the second half. So, if the macro is not as supportive and maybe we don\u2019t see as much growth as we expect, Will we still be able to deliver margin improvement? Yes. I think we will.\nOperator: And your last question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much for squeezing me in. Mike, just a quick question. You talked about excess capacity. Actually, it might have been Kevin mentioned that. We have plenty of capacity on the line. And I noticed that, dwell was up a little bit. So, I guess my question is, are there opportunities you said you\u2019re testing the railroad, here and there, seeing what it can do, to run with fewer locomotives or fewer cars or maybe technology can help you drive efficiency on the asset side. I\u2019m not talking so much about the people side here because you mentioned that earlier. But I was just kind of wondering, because cars online were up about 3,000 cars sequentially. I don\u2019t know if that was seasonal or not. But what kinds of opportunities do you see for improved asset utilization on the rail?\nMike Cory: Thanks, Jeff. Just to clarify, what I what we\u2019re speaking about before was an intermodal shift. So, I was speaking specifically about our intermodal trains and the capacity that we have in that network. But everything you talked about, the answer is, yes. Do we want to run with fewer locomotives? Will there be technology that enhances what it is we\u2019re doing? Absolutely. The biggest thing we\u2019re focused on right now is outside of the day to day sweeping the corners, making sure people understand what the standards are and how to go about, achieving them. We\u2019re looking at infrastructure that we have. And so there there\u2019s some opportunities to reduce out of route miles, reduce a lot of handlings, essentially create mass where we don\u2019t have it today. This railroad has customers everywhere versus it being linear where you can accumulate all your traffic, you can switch it out, and it runs. So, we\u2019re going to try. We are looking at our network to see areas where we can bring and create mass in certain places and eliminate all those touches that we do. We do a lot of work online and road with trains block swapping because we just don\u2019t have the mass at the origin terminal. So, there\u2019s opportunities there and at our in our Investor Day or when we get together, we\u2019ll lay out far more than just me talking about it. We\u2019ll show you what we\u2019re talking about there.\nOperator: Thank you. With no further questions, this concludes our Q&A session and the conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. As Joe referenced, we are really seeing a lot of positive momentum, particularly around sales and marketing collaborating with operations. Highlighting these initiatives are the market reviews where our teams come together to discuss and evaluate opportunities to collaborate on operational efficiencies while delivering new solutions to target profitable business. Driving network efficiencies allows us to deliver a more competitive service product and expand the opportunity for growth. We are continuing to be very aggressive in pushing forward on our truck conversions, new industrial development projects, and creative solutions with the growing number of shippers who want to maximize their use of CSX rail. As you've heard from a number of our peers and competitors across the transportation industry over these past weeks, the trucking market remains challenged and industrial markets are mixed as we move into the second half of the year. Accumulating effects of interest rates including a sluggish housing market and fluctuating commodity prices creates headwinds for some of the markets we serve. It's a volatile environment, but we continue to drive initiatives to accelerate modal share and expand CSX's addressable market. Let's turn to Slide 7, and look at our merchandise performance. We had a great result with revenues up 5% on a 1% increase in volume. RPU was higher by 4% even with fuel surcharge lower year-over-year. As we continue to get pricing results that reflect the strong service that the team is delivering. Throughout the second quarter, our chemicals franchise has performed very well as momentum has persisted in plastics, industrial chemicals, waste, and energy markets. Minerals revenues also saw positive results driven by industrial development wins and our unique network access into the southeast markets including Florida where we see a multi-year glide path for growth. Our Forest Products business began to accelerate driven by demand in pulp board and recent wins in the northeast portion of our network. We've been developing some very promising strategic partnerships in this market to take advantage of the capacity that our network has available, which puts us in a good position to gain more truck share as the housing market rebounds. Our Automotive business saw 4% revenue growth, leveraging our strong service product to deliver a competitive win with a key customer. Less favorable this quarter was metals, where high inventories and expectations of weaker steel prices weighed on volumes. This is probably the market with the most near-term uncertainty as we watch trends in coil, plate, and scrap prices for a recovery. Fertilizer volumes continue to be hurt by phosphate production issues here in Florida. As in past quarters, lower volumes of this short haul of business, does have a favorable mix effect on the total fertilizer RPU. And Ag and Food remains soft on unfavorable regional crop supply dynamics. So, we are very encouraged by the fundamentals into the back half of the year where we see a weaker southeastern crop leading to incremental opportunities for growth. For the remainder of the year, despite a sluggish economy and persistently weak trucking market, we expect to capitalize on our best-in-class service to deliver growth. Chemicals should remain strong supported by business wins, steady plastics and healthy waste moves. We also see opportunities in our Forest Product segment where we see operational focus differentiating us in the market. We're also anticipating a much better second half for our Ag and Food business with demand supported by larger hog and chicken herds in the Southeast, which will need feed grain supplies from the Midwest. Turning to Slide 8 in the coal business. First, I want to reiterate Joe's comments from the beginning of the call. Our team in Baltimore did a fantastic job of finding creative solutions to move coal after the Key Bridge collapse. Their efforts made a huge difference in reducing the negative impact that this incident had on CSX and the customers we serve. As we highlighted at a conference earlier this spring, operations at Curtis Bay were up and running at the end of May, several weeks ahead of our original projections. For the quarter, revenues were down 12%. We estimate that without the Key Bridge collapse, the year-over-year decline would have been more in the range of 5%. Volume was down only 3% with the decline driven by domestic shipments largely to utilities. Key here is that our team was able to grow export volume by 8% year-over-year which is an extraordinary result given the closure of the Port of Baltimore. Our PE was 9% lower year-over-year and 6% lower sequentially in-line with our expectations and driven by export benchmark prices and unfavorable utility mix. Looking ahead, the key benchmark for high-quality Australian coal remains above $200 per metric ton. Given the lag in our export coal contracts, we expect a mid-to-high single-digit sequential decline for all in coal RPU in the third quarter. The temporary idling of a recently opened export mine on our network should have little impact on our export volumes as we see strong production offsets at other CSX served mines. Just as we did this last quarter, the team is already finding some creative ways to pivot towards other opportunities in the marketplace where we see strong demand for export capacity at our Curtis Bay terminal. On the domestic side, low natural gas prices continue to impact volumes, but we've seen some good signs from the hot summer with several utilities in our service region maximizing their coal units in response to very strong demand. We've also seen inventory levels moderate from the highs seen earlier in the year. Finally turning to Intermodal on Slide 9, revenue increased 3% on 5% volume growth. RPU declined 2% as we felt the effects of lower fuel surcharge revenue and negative mix. Our International business drove our volume growth this quarter supported by higher East Coast import activity and favorable alignment with our steamship line partners. This has been the trend through the year and we've been pleased to see customer activity remain solid so far in the Q3. In contrast, momentum in our domestic intermodal business remains muted as weak trucking conditions persist. The weak trucking market has continued much longer than what was expected coming into the year, but in the meantime, we'll keep pushing hard in a tough environment, leading with our best-in-class service. All-in, the collective team has been capitalizing on opportunities throughout the year, working together to win business and gain share for CSX. With mixed conditions across end markets, we've been able to grow total volume by 3% year-to-date while setting ourselves up for more profitable growth over the longer-term by demonstrating to our customers that CSX stands apart for our service, creativity, efficiency, and capacity. Now, let me turn it over to, Sean. Yes. I guess that's a magic question, right? When does the domestic market recover, given what we've seen on the export or the import side of the business. I think, I don't we're still not hearing from customers a major shift, in their activity from the east to the west. If that were to occur, I think it probably presents maybe more opportunities than risk for our business, especially if some things want to move further into the eastern part of our network where today that's truck. So, it's a watch item for us. We'll be close with Mike and his team and able to capitalize on that if we see a shift, which this team is well prepared to capitalize on. Yes, we all listen to the earnings calls from our customers on the domestic side, and I think, we all came into the year a little bit more optimistic on the recovery. It will come, but it's been pushed to the right. That's for sure. And, I think, hopefully, the import business will be a precursor to, some better days ahead on the domestic side, but we're not yet seeing that uplift necessarily as you've heard from a lot of our customers, on their earnings calls. Yeah. I'll let Mike, follow-up. But from a capacity standpoint, we're working really close, with our team. I think we're well-positioned to adjust as we have in the past, when these events happen, temporarily. But, like you mentioned, there's opportunities probably for some longer haul, business should, we see a disruption on the East Coast and some more volumes that would traditionally move east local. Think about the New York markets and maybe some of the southeastern markets that are locally trucked, that would have to move through the West Coast. That that's an opportunity for all of us to participate, and we'll be more than ready to do that. But I'll hand it over to, Mike to talk about capacity. Yes. On the second question, clearly, facing a truck market when you're trying to convert truck is not the most ideal backdrop to do that, but we've had a lot of success. And, you're going to see that success really build momentum as that market comes back. So, and on the intermodal side, not as strong of a pricing environment, which we've been pretty transparent about. On the merchandise side, given our service, given the value we're providing to customers, given the efficiency we're driving for them, we're having really good discussions around there. And, you're right. A lot of that re-pricing every year comes out at the end of the year in the first part of next year. But, with inflation coming down, those things, those will be factors as well, but we still nothing's really changed from our strategy there. We want to go after volume and price, and deliver the value to our customers so they are, see the value in, giving us more business along with, obviously covering the cost and the inflation that we will have to absorb every year. Yes. I mean, Joe mentioned at Investor Day in November, and we're certainly going to put probably more of a bow on the story and, kind of open up, a lot more of the details and share with all of you. But, we are seeing that acceleration, this year, year-over-year, in that range that I mentioned. And, when you look at full run rate and some of these projects can take a year or two to really get up to full run rate volume, But, the pickup in terms of things that we're seeing put in place this year has certainly accelerated this year, and we anticipate that'll accelerate next year and then the following year. So, that means, several years of growth as those projects really come up to full rate production. On average, a lot of these projects are $2 million. So, it's a lot of small things that add up to a fairly large number. We do have the larger projects in there as well, but it's a very diverse, set of projects, opportunities that are that are coming online across a number of our merchandise network segments. So it's exciting. We still see the momentum out there. I think, it's going to be fun to talk about it in November and, and share more of those details with you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. As Mike and the operations team continue to drive efficiency with strong service, we're challenging ourselves to hold support costs in-line and grow revenue through pricing gains and new business wins. As Joe noted, we've built momentum over the last several quarters and we're looking ahead to strong year-over-year growth in the second half of the year, as we finally cycle some of the discrete items that helped our results in prior years. Revenue was flat in the Q2 while operating income was down 1% when compared to revised prior year results. Merchandise and Intermodal revenue ex fuel was up 5% and was partially offset by about a $100 million of unfavorable impacts related to lower export coal benchmark pricing and the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. Declines in other revenue, fuel recovery, and trucking drove an additional revenue headwind of nearly $60 million. Expenses were 1% higher, and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Interest and other expense was $11 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell by $8 million. As a result, earnings per share was up 9% sequentially and stable year-over-year at $0.49. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. As noted in the quarterly financial report, our review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor drove immaterial adjustments to previously reported financial statements. Second quarter 2023 expense was revised up by $16 million and going forward we expect a similar quarterly expense impact split between labor and PS&O. The labor portion will result in lower capital expenditures, and the adjustments for engineering scrap and labor did not impact cash flow. Total second quarter expense increased by $20 million. Turning to the individual line items, labor and fringe was up $18 million as costs from increased headcount and inflation were partly offset by lower incentive compensation and other items. Headcount declined slightly from the first quarter and is expected to remain relatively stable through the remainder of the year. We expect to deliver labor efficiency gains in the second half while continuing to ensure the training pipeline is stable to offset attrition and support future growth. Also, as a reminder, our union employees are receiving a 4.5% wage increase effective on July 1st, and that will be reflected in a higher sequential cost per employee. Purchase services and other expense increased $8 million as broad based efficiency savings and a favorable insurance recovery, mostly offset cost from inflation, a write-off of inventory in the quarter and other items. Depreciation was up $6 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $11 million driven by a lower gallon price and improved efficiency, partly offset by costs related to higher volume. Through a combination of operating initiatives and effectively leveraging fuel saving technologies, we matched our best quarter of fuel efficiency over the last three calendar years. Finally, equipment and rents decreased by $5 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $4 million. Now, turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 13, free cash flow year to-date is $1.15 billion. This reflects lower net earnings and deferred tax payments made this year, partially offset by the prior year impact of back wage payouts. As expected, capital expenditures are also higher year-over-year as we continue to prioritize investments for the safety, reliability, and long-term growth of our railroad. After fully funding these investments, we distributed nearly $1.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date, and we remain committed to our balanced and opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. A long-term focus on economic profit further aligns our interest with our shareholders. While economic profit is lower year-to-date as we cycle prior year comparisons, the team is strategically focused on growing this measure over time. We expect second half economic profit to be up versus the prior year as profitable growth is paired with disciplined asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital investments. With that, let me turn it back to Joe, for his closing remarks. Sure, Scott. Yes. I mean, I we're not going to give a pinpoint estimate on meaningful improvement in margins or we would have done that, obviously. But, we feel good about the setup for the second half of the year, and I think what's exciting is some of the sort of dust that's been in the year in terms of year-over-year comparison starts to clear in the second half of the year, and you'll see the core momentum that we continue to build both on the cost side, but also, the pricing action, supportive of the service reflective of the service that we're delivering as well as the growth that we're seeing in the business. That'll drop through at very attractive incremental margins. Sequentially, second to the third quarter, you got a couple things going on that are probably worth remembering. One is Kevin's guidance on the coal RPU, which will be down mid to high-single digits. That'll be a big impact. We got the wage step up. For us, that'll be about 20 million. Fuel, we have positive lag in the second quarter. So, depending on where prices go, that could be a headwind as well. That said, we're holding the line on expenses. The things that we can control, obviously, we can't control the wage increase or fuel prices. But outside of that, we feel good about, the run rate that we're at in terms of second quarter for core expenses. And, our focus is on, growing year-over-year and delivering that growth at strong incrementals. Chris, it's Sean. I'll take the restatement first. So, what I mentioned was a $16 million impact in the prior year split between labor and PS&O. Even though there was no restatement for Q2, obviously, because we're reporting Q2 results of this year for the first time, that impact was similar in the second quarter, and that's pretty similar to what we expect on a go-forward basis as well. I'll turn it over to Kevin for pricing. Yes. Ken, I'll take the sequential part first. We're not going to guide specifically to sequential. I did lay out a couple of the factors there that are be somewhat, challenging from 2Q to 3Q, comes with a wage step up, the net fuel, and the coal RPU. That being said, core expenses, we should trend pretty similarly to Q2. And, we'll see what happens in terms of the demand side of the equation. But, again, feel good about low to mid-single digit volume and revenue growth year-over-year in the second half. And then, in terms of the labor opportunities, I think there's always, continued opportunities to drive efficiencies on labor. Mike's clearly focused on overtime reductions out there. We're seeing momentum across many of the crafts. He's also got a team looking very closely at how do we increase retention across the craft workforce T&E in particular. There's significant cost in training those employees, and retention is extraordinarily important, not just from an operating, standpoint, but also from a cost and efficiency standpoint. So, definitely opportunities going forward on the labor side even if it's not headcount. I think headcount will be pretty stable, and we will drive year-over-year improvements in headcount efficiencies where we do expect volume to grow more than headcount in the second half. Yes. I listened to the same call as you did. I think they're obviously a lot closer to it, on a day to day basis, than we are. I think the environment's persisted a lot longer, than what we expected than everyone expected, quite frankly, and we're just, setting ourselves up for the recovery, and I think we're well positioned there. But I don't have any additional anecdotes to add to what we've all heard. I'm hopeful that, we're further along in this cycle than not. And I think we're set up, with what Mike mentioned on our intermodal ops side from a capacity standpoint, we're better positioned than we ever have to bring on the volume. Yeah. Thanks, Jason. I think Kevin has highlighted a number of the areas. One area we didn't talk about was automotive. And while we had strong performance in the first half of the year, I think you've seen the shipments over the last few weeks have been down a little bit coming out of their shutdown period. So, that's one we watch very carefully from the consumer side of things, interest rate sensitivity. You think about it, housing market, auto market are two big areas in our business that are very rate sensitive, so we're watching it very carefully. But my comment was, you know so that's in addition to all the stuff that Kevin talked about earlier. But my comment was more in general, I think. I mean we were thinking about this call. This is even before today's events, when the marketplace, I think there's just a little more uncertainty about where the economy really is. We see a number of areas that we're excited about for the second half of the year. But clearly, we're watching what happens with the Fed. We're watching what happens in the general economy. And, and so I think if you could say where we are today versus two months ago, the economy seems to be a little bit more fragile. And we're optimistic that, you know, it can pick itself up, but we're watching it very carefully. No. Thanks, Mike. I agree. I mean, margin obviously is an indicator of financial health and in our industry, it helps us to understand how efficient we're running the railroad. Clearly, as we're able to grow the business as well and do that at strong incrementals that's going to help the margin, but the margin really isn't the destination. The goal is to grow earnings, to grow economic profit, be disciplined around the way that we spend capital and look for opportunities to invest in things that have a high return, whether those are growth oriented projects or projects that help us to drive further efficiency gains, technology investments, capacity investments across the railroad. That's our primary focus. We think that's the quickest, surest way, to grow the value of the company. And in terms of things changing versus previously, I think you make a good point in terms of the impact of inflation on the rail operating ratio, operating margin equation. That being said, I don't see any reason why we can't continue to see improvement in that metric as we expect across many other metrics, in our financial performance over time if the formula, the equation that we have going for us right now is able to continue, and we've got confidence that we'll be able to do that. Yes. No. Good question, David. If you look at the first half, I mean, I get to about $300 million of kind of unique year-over-year challenges between the Baltimore collapse, the lower export coal pricing, decline in other revenue, net fuel, that's $300 million. Second half is not going to be anywhere near that significant. We will have coal pricing headwinds, but the rest is pretty clean. And then the other thing that's different, in the first half of the year, we were still cycling, some of the labor additions that that came on over the course of last year. So, our labor productivity was negative in the first half of the year. That's going to turn positive in the second half of the year, on our volume growth and, keeping headcount essentially flat from where we are right now. So, those are the two big factors there. There's been a lot of puts and takes, this is Sean, on a year-to-date basis, but, we're pretty much right on our plan in terms of both total volume and revenue, which is which is great. We had a stretch plan in place, across the teams, and we've done a good job when there have been challenges of figuring out ways to offset them. Kevin did a good job of describing that with the key bridge outage in in Baltimore and what we did to adjust there. And we think we'll be able to continue to do that as the year goes forward. And I think I think we also talked about a number of the opportunities. There are some markets that are setting up quite well for us in the second half of the year. It's not guaranteed until we actually move the freight, but we've got a couple areas of strength between ag and food and minerals and chemicals continuing to show nice year-over-year growth. There's some headwinds and some uncertainties out there as well. So, nothing's ever a given, but we're not only focused on growing the volumes. We're also focused on getting the price that we need to get in the marketplace. A lot of that price for this year has already been locked in, and then driving efficiency in the cost base. And we've already seen pretty significant improvements from where we entered the year to where we're exiting the first half of the year that give us confidence we'll be able to hold the line there into the second half. So, if the macro is not as supportive and maybe we don't see as much growth as we expect, Will we still be able to deliver margin improvement? Yes. I think we will."

            "name": "Mike Cory",
            "content": "Thank you, Joe, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. Here's a rundown of our operating activities in the quarter. But before I do that, I'd just like to extend my sincere thanks to the ONE CSX operations team for their effort and their contribution day-in and day-out. We all here truly appreciate everyone's teamwork and efforts. So, let's go to Slide 3, the first slide on safety. We saw positive trends on train accidents for the quarter year-over-year. The reduction was driven mainly by fewer mechanical related derailments and a reduction in human failure accidents, although human failure remains our highest causation factor. On injuries, we saw both an increase in transportation and engineering employee incidents. Slips, trips, and falls remain the highest related cause for injury. This is an area where increased attention to risk has tremendous potential to reduce personal injury. Much of our focus is on the development of heightened risk awareness for our less experienced employees who have the highest rate of accident and injury occurrence. By working with our union colleagues, we're becoming better able to help our employees learn how to identify at risk situations and hazards. Though we have a long way to go, through this collaboration, we believe improvements and safety will take place. We've also embarked on an all-inclusive safe operations cultural transformation. This transformation starts with my leadership team and I will extend throughout to every leader at CSX. This three-year initiative is the most extensive safety leadership program we have ever embarked on. We'll support a culture of risk awareness and care where everyone knows they are valued, appreciated, respected, and included. ONE CSX was the first phase of this effort to align the organization to our values and cultural principles. This next initiative will be an extension of ONE CSX. We'll have a strong focus on strengthening our safety leadership skills while building engagement with our employees. We'll be aggressively identifying and eliminating unacceptable risks in our operations, which benefits all our stakeholders. So, going over to the next slide, overall, our fluidity metrics have remained pretty consistent. Our train speed has improved, but we have seen some variability in dwell. Effectively, our dwell metric reflects a combination of our team focusing on keeping cost tightly in-line while maintaining the level of service our customers require. As we've deeply dug into train size and local service, we found some cases where we were spending money to switch a customer when the service was not necessarily required. This was reducing the dwell metric, but wasn't positively impacting the customer experience, and it wasted precious train and engine resources as well as overall costs. We're eliminating these unproductive handlings even though in some cases it will result in higher overall dwell. On the flip side, we're spending a considerable amount of time evaluating our network infrastructure to identify opportunities that will increase the efficiency of certain yards and reduce the dwell going forward. These evaluation exercises start by analyzing the present level of production against demand, ensuring proper standards are in place and that those standards are being met. Then we aim to increase workload and reduce both handling at other locations and a reduction of route miles when possible. This can entail simple self-funded improvements in the infrastructure at some of our switching yards to eliminate car handlings and route miles. Effectively, we're creating more mass where it makes sense, resulting in improved asset speed, service, and reliability. As we identify physical improvements to the infrastructure, we work with our supervisors to lead that process, so they understand how to extract the intended value and more. This experience teaches them to continue to strive for both productive work and opportunities for service or growth potential. This initial exercise has been also been supported by a reduction in cost through better utilization of our major engineering gangs as well. Through all these exercises, supervisors are the largest area of a focus for us as we continue to develop the bench strength on CSX and position them to understand their overall operations better. And, we're supporting them through a variety of methods, which include increasing visibility of leading indicators. We're teaching them then how to utilize that data to identify areas improvement and the overall cost of their operations, and they get a lot of daily engagement with the senior leadership team. A great greater focus is to ensure they gain a far deeper understanding of the overall operational and customer activities within their charge. We expect to continue improving these metrics as we go forward. Through the actions of our supervisors, we will always weigh customer need and the cost required to do so. Overall, I'm satisfied we're on the right trajectory. We have opportunities and plans in sight for our network infrastructure and as well our operations leaders' ability to improve. Turning over to the next slide, we continue to work with Kevin and the sales and marketing team to align our operations with the needs of our customers. Preferred service and cost discipline are always at the forefront. We strive to understand exactly how our customers work and what they need from us. Having this information in the hand of field level supervisors and stressing connectivity with their customers allows us to provide a very high-level of first and last mile service. Our Trip Plan performance, like the dwell metric, reflects the same effect from a continuous focus on cost and customer need. We've identified areas of opportunity to improve or rely on more specific first mile and last mile metrics along with customer feedback and engagement to ensure we are delivering the needed service. You can see in our CSD numbers that our strong customer engagement and level of service are taking place. In closing, we have much work to do as we always will. With that said, I'm really excited now that our operations leadership team has been together for close to six months. I can see the improvement being made to clarify the importance of our tasks and to increase our information visibility. I can also see the deep thirst for learning from all our supervisors at all levels. And this, to me, is probably the most important factor going forward. This team fully believes our approach to a safe, balanced, and efficient customer focused railroad as many opportunities for improvement ahead, and our plan is to deliver on every one of them. With that, over to you, Kevin. Sure. Thanks, Kevin. Hi, Jon. What's the capacity, Jon? We have the odd train, train pair, let's say, that's, at a higher rate of using capacity. But for the most part, our network can withstand whatever Kevin brings us in terms of intermodal. We've done a lot of work at our terminals. Our intermodal team is really dug in deep here over the last six, eight months to provide that great first and the last mile for the customer. But in terms of the capacity over the network, it's there for us to get, get the business. Sure. Thanks for the question, Tom. Look, we have really made a lot of changes here the last six months, most focused on two things. Well, safety first, as though you can't tell by our metrics on that. But service, whatever we do in terms of whether it's we make changes to the operating plan, which in some cases has caused trains not to run on time right down to making sure that the assets that we have out there are being pushed. So, locomotives being stored. We're doing things right now just to test the railway. And, yes, there's been some drop in some of the metrics, and, yes, they will improve, as we go forward. But, we have opportunities here, first of all, with a very young group of people to learn how to do this properly, and second, for them to partake in it. So, the changes we're making, yes, they're having some effect, nothing material, but some effect on some of our lagging indicators. But, what we're able to do from a cost perspective and still maintain that service is powerful. And, really by focusing on the connectivity between our fields people and their customers, we're starting to see the more benefits come out. So, yes, we'll get our metrics back, but at the same time, we're not running for a metric. We're running for service. We're running for a return, and that's very important. And so, Tom, for me just learning as I go. I've been here 10 months now. I'm not overly concerned. Trust me. It's a focus, as we go through to improve those metrics. And, prior to this storm we had going, we had a pretty good, pretty good July, on those regards. So, metrics will improve, but focus is on cost and service and safety. And, we'll figure out the right metrics from there. Well, I'll start it off, Walter, and nice to hear you. Good that you're on the call. Look, no different than any other time. The margin is not what we're aiming for. We do see a pipeline in terms of efficiencies, and that's again, this is going to take time, but it's happening as we speak that we're developing supervisors to see these things, giving them the tools to be able to relate to them better. And I see a lot of the things I saw in my previous career. There's just opportunity here to connect people and activities where we get rid of waste. And that's our focus, and I'll turn it over to my financial friend here. Thanks, Jeff. Just to clarify, what I what we're speaking about before was an intermodal shift. So, I was speaking specifically about our intermodal trains and the capacity that we have in that network. But everything you talked about, the answer is, yes. Do we want to run with fewer locomotives? Will there be technology that enhances what it is we're doing? Absolutely. The biggest thing we're focused on right now is outside of the day to day sweeping the corners, making sure people understand what the standards are and how to go about, achieving them. We're looking at infrastructure that we have. And so there there's some opportunities to reduce out of route miles, reduce a lot of handlings, essentially create mass where we don't have it today. This railroad has customers everywhere versus it being linear where you can accumulate all your traffic, you can switch it out, and it runs. So, we're going to try. We are looking at our network to see areas where we can bring and create mass in certain places and eliminate all those touches that we do. We do a lot of work online and road with trains block swapping because we just don't have the mass at the origin terminal. So, there's opportunities there and at our in our Investor Day or when we get together, we'll lay out far more than just me talking about it. We'll show you what we're talking about there."

            "name": "Joseph R. Hinrichs",
            "content": "Alright. Thank you, Matthew, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our second quarter call today. Before we start, I want to acknowledge and appreciate all our CSX employees who are out there working throughout the Southeast United States as we deal with the weather effects from Hurricane Debby. We are prioritizing the safety of our employees and our communities in everything we do. Now, this was a strong quarter for CSX. I am pleased that our results reflect the momentum that we are building as a one CSX team. And I'm proud to see how teams all across our railroad are working together in better and more effective ways than ever before. Operationally, we are developing initiatives to take an excellent scheduled railroading model and make it safer, leaner and more cost effective while providing the consistency and flexibility that our growing customer base demands. And commercially, our sales and marketing organization is creating new, more targeted methods for us to go to market, create partnerships and use our leading value proposition to convert customers onto CSX rail. Now, there is much we have accomplished so far this year and we are eager to maintain and build on our momentum over the rest of the year. We keep reminding the entire ONE CSX team that when we are aligned with each other and work together as one team, there's really nothing we cannot achieve. Our employees, our customers, and our shareholders are seeing how we are growing the business, controlling costs, leading in customer service, and leveraging our network capacity in ways we never could before. A successful culture we are building at CSX is delivering positive business outcomes. Now, we can go over some of the highlights. Let's go to Slide 1. On Slide 1, we show that some of the key results from our second quarter compared to revised results from past periods. Later on this call, Sean will provide more detail on the review of the accounting treatment for engineering scrap and certain engineering support labor as described in our financial report. Total volume grew by 2% with our intermodal franchise again leading the unit growth of 5% versus last year. And, we are proud to achieve this result even with the constraints at the Port of Baltimore that impacted our coal shipments. Our coal team did an excellent job finding creative ways to respond to the key bridge collapse and deliver for our customers. Our operating margin reached 39.1% which represents a 280 basis point sequential improvement. Revenue adjusted over $3.7 billion was flat compared to the second quarter of 2023 and up modestly over last quarter as strong merchandise pricing and volume growth offset lower coal prices and decline in other revenue. Operating income was 1% lower than last year but up by 8% sequentially as our efficiency efforts helped reduce expense. Our earnings per share were flat versus last year and up by 9% sequentially. Overall, this was a good quarter that was right in-line with our expectations. Had we not faced the incident in Baltimore, our operating income would have been higher year-over-year. Our challenge now is to keep moving forward by focusing on our execution even as markets fluctuate and unexpected events occur as they always do. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Cory to discuss our operational performance. Alright. Thank you, Sean. Now, we will wind up our prepared remarks by reviewing our guidance for the full year 2024. If you look at Slide 16, we expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single digit range for the second half of the year. Total first half revenue was slightly below our original expectations, largely due to lower fuel prices. The macroeconomic environment does appear a little more uncertain than it did a few months ago. That said, as Kevin described, in merchandise, we see promise across chemicals, forest products, ag and food, and minerals markets supported by increasing customer activity, the ramp up of new projects, and a growing portfolio of business wins. On the other hand, metals and fertilizers have both lagged and appear likely to remain softer through the end of the year. We expect momentum to gradually build in Intermodal supported by strong port activity and the strength of our service performance, which is facilitating new ways of working together with our channel partners. This is allowing us to drive small but meaningful modal conversions even while the truck market still remains soft. The reopening of the Port of Baltimore, return to full operations at Curtis Bay and consistent domestic demand should lead to a modest pickup in coal shipments in the second half of the year. We continue to price according to our leading service, work better together as a ONE CSX team and push forward on our efficiency initiatives. As a result, we expect to deliver a meaningful operating margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in the second half, supported by a very strong incremental margin on our revenues. Our CapEx forecast of approximately $2.5 billion is unchanged as is our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns. We are encouraged by our accomplishments over the first half of the year. Now, we are very focused on executing our plan over the rest of 2024 as we position ourselves for sustained, profitable growth over the long-term. We have the capacity, the operating model, leadership team and the culture we need to ensure that we are the best run railroad in North America. We look forward to sharing more details about our strategy at our upcoming Investor Day in November. Thanks for your interest in our company. Matthew, we're ready to take questions. Yes. I mean, I think you first got to start with last year. Obviously, that was a difficult backdrop for our chemical market, but we have seen some wins on the industrial, development side, that are really starting to, help us there. So, that's been positive in the plastics market, so we've really capitalized on those opportunities. And, I think it's all of the above that you mentioned. We obviously have quality carriers and, that alignment with them, that understanding of the market has helped us in our conversations with customers. In fact, there's a recent customer where we're kind of bundling that opportunity together and allows us for us to work together in a white boarding session to really look at their total network and how we can make that real more rail centric over time. So, those are exciting things. Some of the things that we've been working on for a long time that are really, picking up momentum, but it's really all of the above. It starts with the leading service in the in the east, and we're really, delivering on that, and that allows us to have a really different conversation with our customers than we were able to a year or two ago. Not really any, slowdown. And I think we presented a slide last time that we do have a very, very diverse portfolio and there was a lot of focus on the EV market and certainly we've seen some of that be pushed to the right, but our portfolio is much, much larger than, just the EV segment. So other areas, continue to stay on trend, on pace, and we'll, obviously have a ramp up period over time. But we have we have pretty clear line of sight. A lot of construction is already underway. So, a lot of some capital out there with these projects needing to be finished. So, we feel pretty good that despite maybe, even if the macro scene is a little bit weaker in the back half that these projects, in large part will continue on and be a positive factor for us in the back half and into the next year and the following year. Yes. This is Joe. Last comment to add to that. I appreciate you recognizing, quality carriers as part of our equation when it comes to margins. If you look at our second quarter performance, even with now accounting for scrap and the related labor according to our policies, even looking at fuel being down, we had over 39% margin in our corporate results. But if you look at the as we've said in the past, effective quality carriers is about a 250 basis point effect on our total margin. So, our rail operations, then if you just do that simple math, had over a 41% margin in the second quarter. In a clean quarter with not a lot of exceptional things going on or, like, a lot of those quarters that you're referencing in the past had high fuel surcharge or had a lot of demurrage or storage charges or even had record export coal prices and other things like that. We had a pretty stable quarter even with the Baltimore bridge collapse. And with our rail operations, even with the inflation that we've had over the last couple of years, capable of delivering that kind of performance. And as we've noted optimistic about how we continue to run this as forward, we're very excited about the margin potential of this business, and recognizing that service and our operating efficiency go hand in hand. Having said all of that, if the pursuit is just only to optimize the margin number, this industry or even this company has the potential to turn away good business. And I think it has in the past. If we had a 41% plus operating margin for our rail business last quarter and a 35% margin opportunity present itself, do we turn it down? And where our cost of capital is a lot lower than that, and most businesses don't have that kind of margin. It would deteriorate the average margin on the business, but still incrementally could be good business. And so that's where Sean's point, is very valid. We want to grow earnings, grow cash so we can return that to shareholders and reinvest in the business for profitable growth. And that's the kind of way we look at it. Efficiency matters. There's no question about it. So does safety, so does service. But the big opportunity at these margins is to create profitable growth, which has strong incremental more incremental margins. That's what we're excited about."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the CSX Corporation First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Matthew Korn, Head of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Brianna. Hello everyone and good afternoon and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. Joining me this afternoon are Joe Hinrichs, President and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Cory, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Kevin Boone, Executive Vice President, and Chief Commercial Officer; and Sean Pelkey, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. In presentation accompanying this call, you will find slides with our forward-looking disclosure and our non-GAAP disclosures for your review. With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Joe Hinrichs.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Matthew. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter call. CSX had a solid start to 2024 that was in line with our expectations. I've learned that when it comes to routing, it never really is an easy quarter. And this year has already brought us a number of challenges. Thankfully, we have a great ONE CSX team of over 23,000 people. And as you've seen in our weekly volume performance, our railroad has kept moving forward after the early periods of severe weather in January. The latest incident, of course, has been the tragic Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. CSX had a deep historical relationship with Baltimore and we have important operations there, particularly with our export coal business. We're committed to doing our part to help the city recover. We are happy to see the progress already being made for reopening the port. Later in the call, Mike Cory and Kevin Boone will tell you more about what we are doing now to mitigate the impact of this event for our customers. All that said, we are very pleased with the momentum that we built over the quarter and are seeing in the business today. We knew we had the opportunity to grow our profitability compared to the fourth quarter and we did just that. Our goal was to maintain our strong customer service levels while looking for ways to run the network more efficiently and we have done so. We have more work to do and we are confident in our railroad and are excited about the rest of the year. Now let's start with Slide 1 where we highlight some of the key results from our first quarter. Total volume grew by a solid 3% with strong support from our international -- our intermodal business franchise, which grew at 7% compared to last year. Our operating margin reached 36.8%, which represents a 90 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Revenue of just under $3.7 billion was about 1% lower than a year ago and flat compared to last quarter. Operating income was 8% lower than last year, but up 3% sequentially. While our earnings per share declined by 4% versus last year, EPS grew by 2% compared to the previous quarter. Now altogether, this was a good first quarter that reflected our solid progress. The entire ONE CSX team knows that there's much more that we can achieve given all the opportunities ahead and the great people we have across the entire railroad. But before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and remember Jim Foote, who passed away earlier this week. Jim was our President and CEO from late December, 2017, until I arrived in September of 2022. He guided this company through some very challenging and transformative times in our history, including rebuilding the network after the dramatic changes in 2017 and dealing with the COVID pandemic. I had several impactful and insightful conversations with Jim while I was being recruited to come to CSX. And I thank Jim for his support with our Board of Directors to bring an outsider in as CEO of CSX. We thank Jim for all his contributions to CSX and the railroad industry overall throughout his 40-plus year career. And our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. Now let me turn the call over to Mike Cory who has brought a tremendous amount of new energy and new ideas to CSX to discuss our operational performance.\nMike Cory: Yeah, thank you, Joe, and thanks for everybody for taking the time to be with us today. So let's look at the first slide on safety. While we found improvement in the FRA train accident rate year-over-year, in my view, our overall performance results in this quarter pale in comparison to what this team is capable and will deliver. So as a team we've begun to really work collectively to elevate and integrate the beliefs and actions that a strong safety culture requires. We recognize that in order to successively change our safety performance, we need different and better skills. This includes proactive risk identification for our employees and their supervisors. And we thoroughly investigate every incident to determine the root cause and the necessary follow-ups for any recurrence. And we pass that information on to our employees through portals to ensure the information is shared, learned from, and used in improving everything from training to oversight of all our employees. [Technical Difficulty] employees in both the union and their management provide a key opportunity to build a strong safety culture. We're starting to partner with our union leaders to help us change risk tolerances across our property. And this partnership is starting to provide real benefit toward creating a strong safety culture. This takes time and effort on all sides, but I'm very pleased with our progress so far. We're also listening to our employees' suggestions and we're applying it to our safety plan in order to become more responsive to our customers\u2019 needs in a safe and efficient way. Let's look at the next slide. And looking at this slide, you're going to see our standard velocity and dwell metrics that I'm sure we'll talk about today. Our focus this quarter has been on providing strong customer service while controlling costs. And while we've seen a slight decrease in velocity and an increase in dwell, our train sizes have grown in line with the increase in volume we've handled for our customers year-over-year. Crew starts have remained flat with GTMs up 1.5% and carloads up 3%. Our cost focus also includes management of the large capital program we have our engineering crews working on. And we're focused on making sure they have enough time for the work to be done properly. As a result, our crews are accomplishing all of their scheduled work and are also gaining efficiency. In both [tie] (ph) and rails, we've seen reductions in unit costs, good reductions. As we've enforced stricter compliance with planned track time for crews, we've seen slight decreases in velocity increases as well. Our intent is to build and execute a more inclusive plan that provides the right work window while minimizing loss of velocity. And I expect to see improvement as we continue to refine and develop this plan for the rest of this year cycle and beyond. Our focus on cost has also identified some strategic locations that are not as productive as they could be. We see cost saving opportunities by reconfiguring and strategically utilizing these assets into our operating plan. This will reduce cars running out of route and excess handlings, and our customers will benefit as we increase speed and open up capacity in one of the corridors. And that's the most important part. It is we make these changes to our operation. There's no change to our goal of servicing the customer the best way we can. Having an efficient network that can consistently perform to our customers needs will allow us to gain share, and build business from truck and attract new customers to rail. Over to the next slide. On this slide, you're going to see some of our customer service metrics, which still remains strong. Intermodal trip plan compliance remains high. Truck drive return times and arrival to availability, which is a measure of efficiency at the yard, has also improved as we collaborate with our customers to improve the experience of their terminals. As an example, our Fairburn terminal, southeast of Atlanta, is a critical asset for our domestic intermodal business, but has not performed to our customers' needs as well as our expectations. Our intermodal leader put together a team and they developed better process for use of both the footprint and the assets, in turn creating fluidity that has reduced driver dwell at Fairburn by nearly 50% in recent weeks compared to earlier in the year and previous to that. This leads to capacity and more opportunity for conversion from truck. Our carload trip compliance declined slightly, but remained over 80% for the quarter and has improved in the first month of Q2. We're very proud of the service that our customers experience with CSX. To show this, we've added another important metric to this slide, and that's customer switch data, which represents our reliability to be able to deliver on our commitments at the first and last mile of service for our customers and most of our short-line partners. As you can see, this remains very high. In closing, we have many opportunities ahead of us. The team is focused on creating a climate of success for all involved. Our focus on safety, service, and efficiency won't waver as we continue to provide the best service product we can for our customers. With that, over to you Kevin.\nKevin Boone: All right, thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. The team continues to build momentum with our customers, targeting modal share conversion and quickly bringing solutions to the market that target profitable growth. Our ability to react quickly and provide solutions for our customers was highlighted by our efforts in Baltimore, where we rapidly stood up an alternative solution to meet the intermodal needs of the community. Despite a continuing weak truck market, the team has done a great job focusing on developing new opportunities, including truck to rail conversion, industrial development, working closer with our rail partners to identify joint opportunities and accelerating strategic discussions that allow our customers to benefit from our best-in-class service. Communication and collaboration between sales and marketing and operations is a key differentiator for CSX. Our recent voice of the customer survey results for the first quarter shows the highest service scores since we began the survey, which highlights the positive trajectory that we are on. Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at our merchandise performance. Our merchandise revenues were up 1% compared to last year with flat volumes and a 1% increase in RPU as contract renewals and slightly favorable mix more than offset the effect of lower fuel surcharge. Across the business lines, automotive accelerated nicely after a slow start at several manufacturing plants. Chemicals, our largest market continues to gain momentum in plastics, food, and NGLs. Forest product volumes were flat overall but saw encouraging signs in pull board and building products as the construction season appears to be off to a stronger start. We told you that minerals face a tough comparison for aggregates, which were unseasonably strong in the first quarter of 2023. But total demand is very strong against a healthy backlog of large construction projects with infrastructure spending expected to accelerate. Metals volumes were a bit weaker year-over-year with the weather affecting flows in certain scrap markets. Finished steel has also been a bit sluggish, but we see opportunity for sequential improvement in the back half of the year. Fertilizer volumes continue to be unimpacted by phosphate production issues here in Florida, but an early application season in certain markets supported demand for longer-haul, higher-yield shipments of potash and other fertilizers, which lifted our RPU. Finally, our ag and food business remains relatively soft, constrained by a strong global soybean supplies, which limit demand for US exports and still high availability of local crops in many of our customer regions. Underlying demand across grains, feed, and food products is solid and we're optimistic challenging conditions will normalize into the back half of the year. Turning to Slide 8. For the first quarter, coal revenue was flat year-over-year as 2% volume growth was offset by a 2% decline in all-in RPU, largely due to fuel surcharge. Our benchmark-based export yields were slightly lower compared to last year, but we also got some benefit from favorable mix on the domestic side. As expected, shipments reflected the strength in export markets with export tonnage up 25% year-over-year. It really is a testament to the great work by the team, including the credible work by operations to meet the increased demand. We also anticipated that the domestic market would be challenged by low natural gas prices and lapping last year's restocking demand. Domestic shipments for the quarter were down 17% against a very tough comparison in the first quarter of 2023. With Baltimore and the effects of the collapse of the Key Bridge, I'm going to stress how important our partnership is with the city. As Joe noted before, we have a long history with Baltimore, going back to the very beginning of our railroad. And the ONE CSX team is working hard to find alternative solutions to help the community and our customers. In terms of the revenue impact to CSX, export coal will see a near-term headwind with both our Curtis Bay facility and the dual-serve console marine terminal that are unable to load vessels. Two days following the incident, Joe and I joined senior leadership from CSX to visit key alternative export facilities. We have already begun to divert a portion of our Baltimore volumes to other outlets. Currently, we estimate that the net revenue impact to CSX from the port closure is between $25 million and $30 million per month, including the benefit of diverting some of these tons. It's still very early in the remediation process, but the Army Corps of Engineers has projected that the full channel depth, which we need for coal vessels to be reopened by the end of May. It's also likely that you see a good amount of congestion immediately after reopening, but there's potential for it to take a few weeks to ramp back up to full run rate. In the meantime, we are studying in communication with our customers, business partners, state, local, and federal authorities. We are working closely with Mike and his team to make sure we are optimizing all available resources to serve our customers as successfully as possible. Turning the intermodal on Slide 9. Revenue increased 1% on 7% volume growth. Lower fuel surcharge and negative mix pulled our RPU lower by 5%. Growth was very strong for our international business as healthy consumer demand and more normalized inventories have supported higher import levels. We saw volumes increase year-over-year with many of our shipping partners as we gained from new contracts, new lanes, and a comparison with last year's weak market conditions. We are very encouraged by the recovery we are seeing and continued positive demand signals as we look over the rest of the year. Our domestic intermodal business also grew over the quarter at a more moderate pace than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. What's been constant is our service performance, which continues to help us win new business and drive truck conversion even as the weak truck market conditions persist. We're optimistic that truck capacity will normalize in time, even benefit the intermodal market. More importantly, we are confident that we will be prepared when the demand rebounds. Finally, let's turn to Slide 10, where we have an update on our industrial development program. Our project pipeline remains strong with hundreds of companies eager to partner with us to find attractive ways to expand their production capacity on rail surf sites. Something that's often overlooked is how diverse these development projects really are. The chart on left shows the market split. Based on potential carload volume or the approximately 100 facilities that have come online over the last 12 months, these new sites and expansions represent $4.2 billion in total capital investment and have added new capacity in many of our key markets such as chemicals, minerals and forest products. But this is only scratching the surface. The chart on the right shows the market split for the full development pipeline ranging from projects we anticipate starting up later this year to project proposals that will be constructed several years from now. There are two key takeaways from this forward-looking view. First, the total estimated potential carload opportunity measured by expected capacity implies a meaningful acceleration in activity as we look-forward. Scopes can change and timelines can shift, but the setup is very encouraging for meaningful growth contribution over multiple years. Second, the long-term pipeline is also diverse. We are excited about the multiple electric vehicle manufacturing facilities that are scheduled to come online over the next several years. When combined together with related raw material or battery facilities, they represent approximately 12% of the total long-term volume potential. Minerals, metals, chemicals and other projects represent larger contributors. This is a big opportunity for CSX and our industrial development team has been working non-stop to build the partnerships that make all of this possible. We're excited to tell you that there's much more to come. With that, let me turn it off -- let me hand it over to Sean. Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. First quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 8% or $110 million. These results include a number of discrete items versus the prior year with approximately $140 million of impacts from last year's insurance recovery, changes in net fuel, as well as declines in other revenue and export coal pricing. Across merchandise coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery increased 4% in the quarter, benefiting from 3% volume growth and strong pricing across the merchandise portfolio. Expenses were 4% higher and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Underlying results reflect continued momentum generated by the ONE CSX team, both in our service-driven top-line performance and broad-based cost-control and efficiency initiatives. Q1 was our second consecutive quarter of sequential operating income growth despite a $30 million net fuel headwind relative to Q4. In addition, sequential operating margins grew nearly 100 basis points, demonstrating this team's focus on growth and efficient service performance. This momentum positions us well to deliver year-over-year gains in the back half of 2024. Interest and other expense was $9 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell $25 million on lower pretax earnings net of a slightly higher effective rate. As a result, earnings per share decreased $0.02, including $0.05 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total first quarter expense increased by $85 million. Turning to the individual line items, labor and fringe increased $75 million, mostly impacted by inflation, higher headcount, costs from union employees' sick pay, and higher incentive compensation. Even so, cost per employee was down versus the fourth quarter, and we expect cost per employee to again be favorable sequentially in Q2. Total headcount should remain stable despite higher seasonal volumes. Purchase services and other expense increased $23 million, which includes a $46 million impact from a prior year insurance recovery. Efficiency gains evident on this line represent significant cross-functional collaboration to drive sustainable cost improvements across both operating and overhead budgets. We expect this momentum to continue going forward. Depreciation was up $17 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $39 million, mostly driven by a lower gallon price. Progress continued in fuel efficiency, which improved year-over-year and saw smaller than normal seasonal degradation from Q4, despite severe winter weather earlier in the quarter. Finally, equipment and rents increased by $2 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $7 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 14, free cash flow of $560 million is lower year-to-date, driven by a decrease in net earnings, increased investment in the business, and deferred tax payments, partially offset by prior year back wage payouts. CSX exits Q1 with a healthy balance sheet and an A-rated credit profile. Our first priority remains investing capital towards safety, reliability, and long-term growth. CSX also distributed nearly $500 million to shareholders, split between share repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our balanced but opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. We also believe a long-term focus on economic profit aligns our interest with that of our shareholders. While first-quarter economic profit declined due to previously mentioned discrete headwinds, we expect it to increase over time as we efficiently convert freight off the highway while maintaining strong asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital spending. Now with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks.\nJoe Hinrichs: All right. Thank you, Sean. Now, we will conclude our remarks by walking through our guidance for the full year 2024, which has not changed. Led by our customer service, we continue to expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We expect our merchandise business to gain momentum through the year as effects from new business wins, truck conversions, and the ramp-up of industrial development projects build on a favorable trends in many of our end markets. We look for steady growth in intermodal, supported by stable consumer demand and more normalized retail inventories, which are driving improved port activity. We continue to work closely with our channel partners, finding creative solutions to gain share even as the truck market remains soft. Global benchmark coal prices have fluctuated but remain high compared to history. And though the situation at the port of Baltimore limits some of the export volume in the near term, we are taking actions to effectively mitigate as much of the impact as we can. Our team at Curtis Bay and across the rest of the coal franchise will be ready to ramp back up as quickly as possible once the channel returns to full operation. On profitability, we made good progress this quarter and grew our operation margins -- operating margin sequentially. And as you saw in our results and heard from the team on this call, we benefited from volume growth, solid pricing gains, and focused efforts to improve efficiency and productivity. Our goal is to consistently grow our margins over time. And while Baltimore and global coal prices are near-term challenges, we feel very good about our ability to deliver strong incremental performance in the second half of this year. There is no change to our CapEx forecast of $2.5 billion. And as you heard from Sean, our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns remains in place. To conclude, during the quarter, where there were many potential distractions, I am very proud of how the ONE CSX team stuck to our plan, focused on execution, prioritized our customers, and achieved good results. There is much more to come as we make every effort to run safer, faster, and more reliably for our customers so we can deliver profitable growth over the long term. Thanks to all of your interest in the company and, Matthew, we're ready to take questions.\nMatthew Korn: Thank you, Joe. We will now move to our question-and-answer session. In the interest of time and to make sure that everyone on this call has an opportunity to take part, we ask you to please limit yourselves to one and only one question. Brianna, we're ready to start the process.\nOperator: Thank you, Matthew. Your first question comes from Justin Long with Stephens. Please go ahead.\nJustin Long: Thanks. And to start, our thoughts and prayers are going out to Jim's family. Obviously, he left a great legacy on the industry. But for my question, I wanted to ask about the second quarter. Typically, you see a seasonal improvement sequentially in both margins and earnings. Do you still think that's possible despite the impact from the Baltimore port closure? And then I guess along those lines, curious if you have any thoughts around coal RPU in the second quarter as well? Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: Hey, Justin, happy to take both of those questions. So yeah, in terms of sequential improvement, that's normally what we see from Q1 to Q2. While clearly, the Baltimore impact is going to be felt in the second quarter, we still feel that we should be able to grow earnings sequentially from Q1 to Q2. And what I would say is, that's both top-line as well as being able to do it while containing costs and deliver really strong incremental margins from Q1 to Q2. The headwind clearly is export coal, not just the Baltimore impact, but in terms of RPU, I think pricing has come down. What we're seeing right now in the marketplace is probably something that's going to lead to a mid-to-high single-digit decline in coal RPU from Q1 to Q2. But even with that backdrop, still feel pretty good about our ability to continue this momentum.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Chappell with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nJohn Chappell: Thank you, and good afternoon. Mike, as you indicated in your slides, you'd probably talk about velocity and dwell a little bit in this call. So obviously, there's been some disruption, whether it was weather in January or Port of Baltimore in the last part of March, but things have kind of filtered into a little bit into April as well. Can you just give us a state of the union on why some of those metrics have maybe moved in the opposite direction as when you first started and kind of how you get them back moving in the right direction as soon as in the next couple of weeks?\nMike Cory: Yeah, sure, John. Thank you very much for the questions. But I just want to make it really loud and clear. These metrics are extremely important. We're not happy with them. They're not significant, and I'll put it in perspective here. So some of the -- we really shocked the system. And one of the first things we did was really start to look at the efficiency of our capital -- engineering capital programs for $1.5 billion envelope. And quite frankly, last year we didn't get the work done and we paid more than we should have for the work that we got done. So this year we decided that we were going to be very strict about the curfews. And those are anytime the track is out and either for between six and 10 hours across our network for these big giant gangs to get out there and do all their work with rail ties, bridges, you name it. And again, we started this probably around -- you can see the dip probably around early February, late January, because it was after the winter started. But after we went through the winter storms and it really impacted our southern corridors. We stuck to our guns. We held our trains at the terminals to run in line with the curfew that dwells the cars in the yard that also congests and bunches up traffic. And so we really let that go for a month. But then we've been working ever since that point to start to redefine the program that we're doing, split up the work. And one thing we really did before was do all the work in the south during the winter time, because of the winter up north. We've got to find ways and we will to spread the work out. But that in itself caused a fluctuation in train speed from previous years because we did not be that strict. We've come in under our rail and tie budget. So everything unit cost wise is the right way. But the biggest thing it provides that safety -- that safety hardening of the track that we need to do every year with the volume we move. That's number one. If you remember, we went into last quarter, we reduced 5% of our crew starts and we absorbed [1.5%] (ph) GTMs, 3% carloads, whatever you want to call it, without any more change in headcount. What that did was really focuses on increasing the tonnage on the train. That then starts to convert itself to better utilization of locomotives. Something as simple as going from three to two. Those things start to slow the trains. But they're still within an acceptable parameter. And as far as I am concerned right now, it's not where we want to be, though. On top of that, we really took a strict view on our use of trip optimizer. And that's really there to moderate the speed of the train, but again, get its fuel efficiency. We increased our use by over 10% this quarter. So we did all this over the backdrop of a typical first quarter. If you look last year, the numbers came down as well. And then you get whether you want to call it winter. They're excuses, but these things on top of that, I'm comfortable with all the actions we're taking that we will figure out a better way to do the work blocks. But at the same time, this is forcing the folks in our terminals that you don't have as many outlets at times to move their cars. And so we're working through that. In fact, it got to the point now where in going through this exercise, we started to identify some yards that were closed for the right reason, I shouldn't say closed, but they were disconfigured. I'm not talking about opening up pumps, but there's some strategic yards that we're going to look at using as we go forward that I'm looking at quite a few out of road car miles, handlings, all the good stuff that produces more speed, but at a reduced cost. And we don't find that until you start to push the program. We could have easily just absorbed traffic, put some more trains on. PSR is not running the speed. PSR is providing the proper service at the right cost and being able to incrementally grow your margins and grow your business. And so that's really what's going on. I see improvement in the future. I see it every day. I see the engagement of our folks. This has also provided a real opportunity for us to teach our operating supervisors how to balance. As Sean said earlier, there's a lot of cost in everywhere we look on this railway. Obviously, the biggest is labor and fuel, and that's what we're tackling. But this is teaching them how to go about this exercise without at the end sacrificing customer service. And one dwell number we don't show is our arrival to placement for our customers. It's improved 10% in many of the major industrial areas. The reason for that is we have actually increased our local service. We've taken some of the money we saved on the liner although we make sure we're trying to build trust with our customers, because now the next opportunity -- one of the next opportunities to look at their fleets and get them to work with us, to trust us, to be there like we are and hopefully reduce some of the fleet that we have out there and still add more incremental business onto what we have. I hope that answers it, but there's a plan behind this. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTom Wadewitz: Yeah, good afternoon. I wanted to get some thoughts. I think just pricing and I know you got a bunch of moving parts. I'm thinking ex the coal item. But we've seen, I guess from J. B. Hunt and Knight and some of these surface transport-focused companies that there's weak demand and there's even more pressure on pricing. And so I just wanted to try to get a sense of if in your merchandise, you're getting good price, is there some headwind that affects what you do on price and revenue per car from this ongoing weakness. So just, I guess, trying to think about is price stable, is it going to get better and the way we model price, which ends up being revenue per car? Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Yeah, Tom. Nothing has changed on the pricing side. We're obviously a tough truck backdrop. That will improve and we'll see a lot of benefits from that I think, as we see the cycle hopefully has bottomed here from what we're seeing. But I -- when you look at-the market, what we do on the pricing side is obviously, we're able to capture that inflation and I don't see anything really changing there. It's always a balance and we manage the portfolio accordingly. And where there's opportunities, obviously to gain more-and-more volume, we work with our customers, but it's a core to what we -- how our growth algorithm works. It's volume and price as we look at it and nothing has changed there. As hopefully cost inflation comes down, then the customers will benefit from that going-forward. But obviously, not the environment that we had last year where inflation was very-high, that's starting to moderate some. Hopefully, the Fed gets a big-picture too and with the rates and things like that, but that's where we are today. Still as planned, I think I was very happy with what the results in the first-quarter, what the team was able to deliver, and we're right on-track.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Ossenbeck with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nBrian Ossenbeck: Hi, afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess, Sean, I wanted to come back to your comments on headcount. I think you said that it's still relatively flat going into the second quarter, that was the plan. I don't know if that holds for the rest of the year, but it sounded like at least in the near-term, so maybe you can elaborate on that a little bit. And also the comp per employee stepped down sequentially and you expect it to step-down again into 2Q. Can you just explain that trend? And of course, we should probably be thinking that that moves up in 3Q sequentially as you hit the new labor agreement with the 4.5% adjustment. So some additional thoughts on that and how that progresses and headcount overall will be helpful. Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Sure, Brian. Yeah. So on the headcount side, I would say we came into the year, we actually added a little bit from Q4 to Q1. Most of that was for the engineering work that Mike talked about and making sure that we could get everything done this year. We're going to manage that down through attrition. As we get to the second half of the year, we're going to watch business levels. We're going to see how we're running. But I think it's fair to assume that we're going to be relatively stable as we get to the second half, if not down a little bit sequentially. And so you're going to see a clear return to headcount labor productivity in the second half of the year. And then in terms of comp per employee, yep, second quarter will be another step down versus Q1. A couple of reasons for that. One is, first quarter, we had some winter-related costs. And then secondly, as some of the capital-related programs get a little more ramped up in the second quarter that has a benefit to cost per employee sequentially Q2 versus Q1. And then you're right, as we get to the second half of the year, the current labor agreement stipulates a 4.5% union wage increase. So we'll feel the impact of that as we go from second quarter into the second half.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Afternoon. So, Mike, it sounds like you're trying to find a balance right now between some of the service metrics and just OpEx. When you look cost, excluding fuel, was down just slightly from Q4 to Q1, how should we think about just overall cost ex fuel from Q1 into Q2? And then just -- maybe just overall, like we're a quarter into the year, it sounds like margins down year-over-year again in Q2, but inflecting positive in Q3, Q4. So full year, do we think we could see some margin improvement? Or is that -- given the first half, is that too much to ask?\nMike Cory: Thank you, Scott. I'm going to let the expert over here, Sean, talk about margin because as you know, I never talk about margin. But your theories are right, like, we're trying to balance without first of all, safety and the customer without damaging that and we have a long way to go on safety. So these things -- that these things we're looking at are all focused on really on the cost side. So whether if we can shift some of the capital that we're planning to use by being more productive into other areas that we hadn't planned and make some of these yards useful or more useful than they are, I see definite cost benefit. It's things like that. It's not something -- Sean is looking at me, he's going to start talking a bit about the numbers. But really, that is our focus to bring that margin up on the cost side. But I'll turn it over to Scott -- to Sean.\nSean Pelkey: Thanks, Mike. Yeah. And what he says is true. We're focused on how do we deliver growth and how do we do it at strong incremental margins by maintaining the fixed cost profile and not adding a whole lot of variable costs along the way. If not finding opportunities where we can run things more efficiently. So to your direct question about cost ex fuel, I think, yeah, it's fair to assume we got a chance to improve that even further going from Q1 to Q2. And that ties in with the comments I just made about comp per employee and keeping headcount relatively flat. So we'll build some momentum. I think the year-over-year comps are a little more difficult in Q2 given the Baltimore impacts. If that hadn't happened, maybe could have even grown operating income and margin in the second quarter. But with it, it makes it more challenging. Second half of the year, we feel good about the setup. Some of these headwinds that we're facing, the first couple of quarters paid. And we're going to have labor productivity. We'll continue to grow the business. The industrial development projects Kevin talked about, a number of those start to come on as we get a little bit later into the year. So there's a lot to like about it. We are not going to give any specific guidance about full year operating income growth, margin growth. But clearly, sticking with the low to mid-single-digit total volume and revenue growth is very helpful, particularly when we're focused on what we can do to drive continued efficiency gains.\nJoe Hinrichs: This is Joe. Just to add one more comment. So we'll work hard to try and help tell our story a little bit better and differently going forward. But I just want to be clear, our focus on the customer and customer service have not waned at all. And as you heard Kevin mention in his comments, we get surveys from our customers on a regular basis, and we have the best score that we've ever had in the first quarter. So we have to find a way to tell the story that isn't just told by velocity and dwell or even trip plan compliance. That's why we introduced the customer switch data and some other things. For example, our tonnage went up for train. And so if we combine a train, two trains to one, maybe we go from three engines to two engines, on being used in that combination and that higher tonnage train might be a little slower and might tell a little more dwell time, but the customer is okay with it. It helps our efficiency and the customer is still happy. And so -- but that will show up as little more dwell and a little less velocity but better efficiency. And as long as the customer is happy, we're okay. So we check with the customer first and then we work backwards, as opposed to some of the stories you've heard in the past, which was about our internal focus and then tell the customer about it later. That's a very unique and important difference and distinction. But importantly, as you saw quarter-over-quarter, while some of our numbers may look like they degraded, but our efficiency got better and our customer responses and survey responses were the best we ever had. So we're walking that fine line. So we're going to have to find a way to help you guys see that, and at the same time, getting more efficient. And working with our employees as ONE CSX team to teach them how to do that and work together to do that in a positive way. And that's the balance we're trying to do, and I appreciate Mike and his entire operations team working with Kevin and the sales and marketing team to bring that to life, and it's a collaborative effort. And it's worked because it's teaching. It's also listening, is finding creative solutions and not being focused on one metric. And at the end of the day, we can deliver sequential improvements. And so as long as we deliver sequential improvement to our customers and in our earnings, we can show you how that it leads to growth over time. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Kevin, I wonder if we can come back to the industrial development pipeline that you guys have been mentioning, the new graphic in the slide is somewhat helpful. But can you talk about the 100 facilities that have already opened and some examples where that's delivering volume today? And then how you expect that works through the end of '24 and into the beginning of next year?\nKevin Boone: Yeah. I mean, look, we're in the very early stages of this. And when the facility comes online, there's usually -- depending on the industry, a 12- to 24-month ramp, right? And so for this year, for example, we have in the aggregate side, really on the metal side as well as where we've seen some concentration in that activity as we look forward. You can see where the activity is going to take place. But these projects, some of them longer than others. But once they come online, there's really a guide path of growth, as related to that as we bring that capacity on and enter the market. So -- we're excited about it. I think we'll share a lot more as the year progresses on and give you a lot more detail on how that layers in over time. But we thought we'd give a little more color just around how diverse that pipeline is and how it continues to build. And I think that's exciting to have diversity around. We're not concentrated in one single industry. It's really -- we're seeing it across the board in the markets that we serve.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nKen Hoexter: Great. Thanks. And I'll throw in my condolences also to the Foote family, always had fun discussions with Jim over the last 20 years and appreciated his insights. So thanks for the comments earlier. Mike, just following up on another step here. Looking at flat headcount, low to mid-single-digit volumes and revenues. So when should we expect to see the service stats improve? When do we get the flow through? Have you seen that already in the data in April? And then I guess thinking about Baltimore and the impact of coal volumes now down 12.5% last week. So Baltimore is now impacting the results. How should we think about what percent of volumes can be moved to Newport and maybe improve some of the metrics? Thanks.\nMike Cory: Yeah, Ken. That's a good question. I almost -- I thought I explained earlier. I'm not -- I can't give you an answer so much on when do we expect to see the service improve because the service is good. Like, we -- I expect to see over the next few quarters here, yeah, the velocity and dwell will continue to improve versus what they are. But the service level is going to be what the customer needs. And right now, that's what we're fulfilling. But -- so again, we're going to do a lot of different things here to test our facilities, our people that put -- we're trying to put stricter process in place. And that's going to have some effect until we learn to get through it. But I see the metrics improving. I see them now improving. It's just we still have -- we still have the odd thing that's taking place and lots of it's revolved around these engineering gangs that we are full hearted, like our full engineering team plus our operating, our transportation team are meeting as we speak, to continue to find a way to not have such restricted curfews, but we have to do. Other than that, the network is fluid. And I'll let Kevin talk about Baltimore and what we are doing with the shifting to Newport.\nKevin Boone: Yeah. I think just looking at last week, not that we live week to week, this is going to be a little bit choppy with some of the terminals we're working with in terms of taking on some additional capacity. I don't think last week necessarily the trend that we're seeing, we're seeing some good performance and then stepping up here this week on that. But when you look at the impact, I explained $25 million to $30 million net impact from the Baltimore incident, that will continue at least through May, and then we'll probably have a hopefully glide path end of June of improving that. But we're looking at offsetting a third of that business, maybe a little bit more if we can get all of the terminals to work with us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jordan Alliger with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJordan Alliger: Yeah. Hi, thanks. Just curious, can you talk a little bit maybe specifically what the international intermodal growth was in the quarter versus domestic? And based on your comments, it seems like International is outstripping domestic, maybe by a wide margin. I'm not sure. Why is that the case? And what gets domestic Intermodal growth rate back up? You trip plan compliance looks really good. So I'm just sort of curious those dynamic plans.\nKevin Boone: Look, I think, obviously, the comps on the International side were fairly easy in the first quarter. That's where we saw some pretty dramatic declines last year, as you saw destocking happening almost across the board in a lot of companies out there. So we benefited from that. The team has done an amazing job of identifying new services, some other areas, that identified some profitable growth that we went after, good contract relationships. We're aligned with the right partners, and we benefited from that. So you've seen double-digit growth on our international side, while our domestic was slightly up this past quarter and the domestic market is a lot more truck competitive, as we all know. And if you've been listening the last couple of days, it hasn't been -- the trucking companies have obviously struggled, and I think we're pretty proud of the results we were able to put up in that context. We think there's better days ahead, but certainly a challenging market and the results were good in that context for sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bascome Majors with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nBascome Majors: Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk a bit about how some of the emerging uncertainty at your Eastern competitor has helped you perhaps capture some volume short term? And maybe longer term, has that uncertainty at another rail impacted the desire or intention of some of your customers to really start to use rail more as an outlet in their supply chains that you've been working for years now with industrial development and other efforts? Thank you.\nJoe Hinrichs: Thanks, Bascome. This is Joe. As you know, certainly in the time frame that I've been here with this ONE CSX team, we've been really focused on our mission, which is really to focus on improving the employee culture and the employee experience through ONE CSX and to get better service to our customers, which we believe will lead to profitable growth for ourselves and importantly, growth with our customers. That hasn't changed and hasn't waned. I think in fact, what you've seen over the last couple of months is customers coming out and wanting that commitment to service and that commitment to -- for our whole industry to be focused on what can we do to grow. So we're not distracted by what's going on and certainly not getting distracted by it. We're focused on what we can do, and as you saw in the quarter sequential improvement across the Board, and we talked about our confidence in to be able to continue to deliver that. And that's what I'm really proud of our team, is not getting distracted and staying focused on our customers, on our employees. We need to improve safety, as Mike talked about and looking for opportunities to grow. And what we're hearing from customers, they're very happy with the service CSX is providing, and they're very pleased with the continuity and the consistency of our messaging, but also our results, interactions. And that's what we want to stay focused on. At the higher level, as you hinted at, as an industry, we have to continue to get better service to our customers. I talked about it extensively at many different conferences and events, and we're all working together to do that. I'm seeing more collaboration across the industry to make that happen, and I'm encouraged by that, and we want to be a part of that. And so to ultimately realize the potential of this entire industry, we all need to get better, at the fluidity of our network, how we work together and the service we provide to our customers. And that's going to take us working better with all the stakeholders in this industry to help make that happen. So we can grow as industry if and when we all get better at customer service and working together. So that's the focus we have at CSX. You're not going to see us change our -- there's no 2.0 or 3.0, 4.0 plan. It's the same ONE CSX, focusing on our employees and our customers, and you're going to see us continue to execute. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jason Seidl with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nJason Seidl: Thank you operator. Sort of along those lines, we've seen a huge shift on the intermodal side back to the over-the-road operators mainly due to price. And then I guess, last year, some operational issues at the Class I rails and some declining diesel prices. I guess two things. What percent do you think the gap has to close between where trucking pricing is now for domestic intermodal to start getting business back? And have you been able to quantify just how much freight shifted to the over-the-road market? Thanks.\nKevin Boone: Yeah. Thanks, Jason. Look, there's still a value proposition out there. Was it a little bit tighter than maybe a year ago when truck prices were a lot healthier? Absolutely. And I think the discussion is more about when you look at it, what can add value in the near term. I mean when you have to do nothing and you get price declines in your trucking business, then you're not as compelled to look at the intermodal option as you would be in a more normalized market. And so I think that all probably balances out as we get it through the year. It feels like we're at the bottom, bouncing along here. And as things solidify, I think those conversations accelerate. We've put up domestic growth, and we're pretty proud of that. The product that we're offering, the service that we're offering is compelling in the market even at these lows, and I can only imagine how compelling it\u2019s going to be as the market recovers. So we're pretty excited about it. We're talking about it actively as a group of when the growth comes back, that we're going to be prepared more than anybody else to handle it. So that's exciting for us. When that recovery happens, we're not certain, I think it's fair to say the trucking market is probably a little bit worse than what people anticipated coming into the year, but we were pretty resilient in a very, very challenging market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ben Nolan with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nBen Nolan: Yeah, thanks. I was going to ask a little bit about the Baltimore impact, I appreciate the $25 million to $30 million a month. Just curious if that is predominantly coal or if there are any other impacts on maybe some of the other business lines? And then also in addition to the revenue impact, are there any cost impacts from rerouting to other ports or anything below the revenue line that we should think about?\nKevin Boone: I'll cover the revenue one. That one's easy. It's coal that we're seeing there, maybe some slight opportunities, but they're not large enough to be impactful to that number. On the cost side, Mike.\nMike Cory: Yeah. And I think Kevin alluded to it, we had a little bit of a rough start-up going over to Newport and that's now smoothed itself out. But really not a lot more cost then. The -- most of the traffic moves through, other than the [point of coal] (ph). So not significant in that sense, no.\nKevin Boone: I just want to tell you guys a little story because I get often asked all the time, what are the benefits of ONE CSX and the culture we're trying to achieve here. Within two days of the incident in Baltimore, we put out a request for transfers from our engineers and conductors, who were in our locations to be able to relocate temporarily for a couple of months to help with the change in the train setup and schedule we needed to support the movement of coal elsewhere. And we needed maybe a dozen people to go, and we had seven, eight times that people immediately sign up to help. And that's a testament to what we're seeing here is that our people are willing to be a part of the solution and to serve our customers and know how important that is. And that's just a great example. So there's a little bit of cost of that relocation and a temporary transfer. But I can tell you, a little over a year ago, we were trying to get temporary transfers, and we struggled. And this time, we have so many people signed up, it was great to see. And those are the signs you want to see of a healthy culture and people are really service oriented, but also understand the bigger picture of what we're trying to do here in serving our customers. And so we have not been the constraint or the bottleneck at all. In fact, we've been able to really -- Kevin and I were with one of our largest coal customers the other day and he was just so proud of the work we've done and our team has done to respond so quickly and be able to react, and that's a testament to our people. That's just another example of why it's so important to stay consistently focused on our culture and our people and help them understand that we're here to serve customers, and that's why we exist to do it safely, obviously, and efficiently, but that message is resonating and our people are responding.\nMike Cory: And just one more point, Ben, I should mention this is. With this issue, we've been able to get a betterment in terms of our maintenance at Curtis Bay. We've been able to go in there and do work that we would have had to do it under load with a lot of volume moving through. So we've fully taken advantage of some pretty major restoration that we were able to accomplish that we're still working on. So that's been a good thing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Amit Mehrotra with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nAmit Mehrotra: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Sean, I just wanted to clarify one quick thing. I think in response to the first question, regarding 1Q to 2Q, you said profits up. I don't know if you said margins up. You may have said it, but I didn't catch it. Just want to clarify by that point. And then, Kevin, I just wanted to talk about interchange. So I think before -- unless I\u2019m mistaken, maybe you interchange half your volumes. Any -- is that mostly evenly split between the two West Coast rails or I'm just trying to understand how much do you actually interchange with UP? And what proportion of kind of that interchange -- total interchange is actually represented by the EP? Thank you.\nSean Pelkey: Amit, it's Sean. I'll take the first part. Yeah, profit up Q2 versus Q1 and margins up. I think that's a fair expectation on both sides.\nKevin Boone: Look, I think we said roughly half of our business touches another railroad. And certainly, when you look at the Western railroads, particularly UP, they are a very large part of that. So they're a very important partner to us. All of our partners are very important. So it's encouraging to hearing a lot of signs to go after more business, and we're working collaboratively to do that. So a lot of opportunities out there that we see.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Walter Spracklin with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nWalter Spracklin: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Sean, when I'm comparing your outlook, and I know your outlook is unchanged from prior. When I look at your -- what -- some of your commentary regarding the moving parts that have occurred in the first quarter and looking into the rest of the year, you did have a little bit of a tougher January. Mike pointed to some operating measures that aren't where we want them to be. You've got a worse coal market, there was a Baltimore outage. Trucking is worse but you maintain your guidance. So I'm just curious as to what -- if those are the puts, what are the takes in terms of what's the offset here to maintain your guidance despite kind of those headwinds that emerged a little bit here so far in 2024?\nSean Pelkey: Yeah, Walter, I'll do my best on that one. So yeah, I mean, certainly, a little bit of winter in January, couple of things there. And then, of course, the Baltimore outage was unexpected, and that's a hit to the forecast. But still feel very confident about what the second half looks like, in particular, from a volume and revenue perspective and what it looks like on the cost side. We did an exercise here where we looked at every dollar of every budget and there's a lot of small wins that we're getting here, just $1 million, $2 million here and there across every line item, both within operations and across the business. So I think it's everybody focused on how do we deliver the kind of economic financial performance that sort of backs up all the momentum that we've got with ONE CSX, the goodwill that we've got with the customer. And to the extent there's revenue headwinds, how do we close the gap on some of those, but still a lot of confidence, I think, from the CSX team.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephanie Moore with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nStephanie Moore: Hi, good afternoon, thank you. I wanted to maybe switch gears a little bit and talk about maybe capital allocation and maybe your focus on share repurchases, have seen it kind of come down a little bit over the last couple of quarters. So I just wanted to gauge your appetite in terms of incremental share repurchases as the year progresses. Thanks.\nSean Pelkey: Thanks, Stephanie. It\u2019s Sean. We're still committed to the share repurchase as well as the dividend. It's certainly a step down in the first quarter of the year, but we -- the stock ran up pretty quickly. And so we try to be opportunistic and gauge the amount of buybacks that we do based on the momentum in the stock. So with the pullback that we've had recently, we're buying a little bit more. Still committed to do a significant amount of share repurchases this year. It will be a little bit less than it was last year, just simply because we came into the year with a little bit less cash on the balance sheet. And last year, we raised a little bit of incremental debt to help juice the system, and that led to some additional buybacks, but we're still very committed to that, and you'll see it go up and down quarter-to-quarter just based on the opportunity that we have in the market.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, a two-parter here on the ports. One just on Baltimore, a follow-up. I think you've said you redirected about 33% of the traffic so far. Does that mean there's going to be like pent-up demand when the channel is kind of normalized in 3Q or late 2Q and beyond? Just wanted to confirm that. And also on the East Coast to West Coast kind of share shift, kind of what innings are we kind of on the normalization there? And are you hearing from your customers ahead of labor talks on the East Coast ports and maybe any preparations there? Thank you.\nKevin Boone: Yeah. Look, in terms of pent-up demand, there's outages in the summer that happened for the coal miners and we'll see how they handle that with some of the obviously, slowdown that we've seen. Is there opportunity to make up to this volume in the third and fourth quarter? There is. That's not in the plan right now, but we'll see how that plays out. The prices remain strong. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of incentive to meet those contractual obligations and those things. On the East Coast, West Coast, look, if you've been to Savannah lately, there's huge, huge investments going on in investments. Obviously, when you're spending billions of dollars, you've got to have visibility to the demand out there and -- there's tremendous demand that they see coming. And we're not hearing any anticipation of significant trade moving from the east to west. Obviously, if that happened and they want to move to the East, there could be a net benefit to us. So I think from our perspective, it's probably a neutral outcome if that happened. And in some cases, you could see some business that normally would come into the ports and move truck that would come over the less than move over our railroad, which would be an incremental opportunity for us. So I don't see a high probability to risk there, maybe some more opportunities if that happens, but we'll continue to watch it. But over the long term, we see a lot of capacity growth in the East, and it\u2019s just not there in the West.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.\nJD Millan: Thank you for taking the question. This is JD Millan for David Vernon. I guess, Kevin, going back to the question on the 10x opportunity, can you give us some more color on what is driving this massive tenfold increase? Is it just traffic coming on from the highway in [indiscernible], or is it more of an increase on the efforts from your team? Just a little bit of color on that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKevin Boone: I think generally, there's a lot of geopolitical risk out there. There's a lot of movement in terms of how companies post the pandemic are thinking about their supply chains. And we talked about this before, but a supply -- their supply chains are being viewed as competitive advantages and being closer to your end consumer, which we have the most valuable consumers in our network in the world, it's becoming a priority, and we're seeing those investments take place to really happen. So it's broad based, as I mentioned, a lot of activity, but I think that's the major draw. I think they saw through the pandemic, a lot of disruption with how much it costs to get things delivered to the end consumers. So now it provides an opportunity where we can maybe get the inbound and the outbound, which is pretty exciting for us. So it will happen over time. There's already a lot of capital on the ground, a lot of the capital that's already been spent. So we'll participate in that. But it's a really shift from what we've seen probably over the last three or four decades, in terms of activity. And rather than the industrial base decaying within our network, we see some growth in that industrial base, which should benefit us over time.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Kauffman: Thank you very much. And our thoughts are with the Foote family as well, just a terrific guy. I want to go back to Bascome's question on any nervousness with customers using other rails, given all the media and the hype, maybe not so much in terms of customer wins, but at this point, what types of questions or what types of concerns are being raised to you? And is there an anxiety among the customer base?\nKevin Boone: Look, I mean, I've seen more activity with our customers willing us to share us their truck files to really open up the book in terms of what their supply chain looks like, given some of the service performance we've been able to achieve over the last few quarters. So that's exciting for us. We're really looking internally about what we can deliver. I think customers want certainty and they want visibility. And I think we're providing that. They understand the path we're on. They're supportive of that path, and they're seeing the service along with it. So we had many customers last year, say, hey, we want to see the service and then we can talk about more opportunities for you. And now we're in the midst of a lot of those discussions, and it's -- the team is working really hard. The backdrop, the wind is not at our back. Clearly, we have a lot of markets that are at cyclical lows. Those will come back. But the opportunity right now is to win wallet share. And as you win wallet share and the markets turn, that would translate into a lot of growth for us. So incredibly excited. We're internally focused on what we can accomplish those discussions, what we can deliver. And I think we're having a lot of those conversations.\nJoe Hinrichs: And Joe, Kevin and I have -- sorry, Kevin and I have spent, I don't know how many customers we've met with in the last couple of months, but we've had an FDA and a number of other events. I think we've touched almost every major customer we have and directly personally. And we've seen a lot of -- gotten a lot of feedback on the consistency, reliability and the continuity of our messaging and also our actions. And that's what customers want, having been on for decades myself just want to have reliability and they want constancy of purpose. They want to know what you stand for is you're going to deliver it. And that's what we're starting to show, and as Kevin said, our customer is starting to trust us again, which is the foundation for us to be able to grow with them as from the trust us, and that's the trust we want to keep delivering and building and gaining because of the constancy of what we're standing for, which is, of course, -- we're going to engage our employees with ONE CSX to serve our customers better and do that with better safety. The efficiency will come from the actions that we teach and what we do. And so we're going to stay on that course and it's delivering for us, and you saw it in the first quarter, and you'll see it again next quarter.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. And that does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Joe Hinrichs",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Matthew. Hello, everyone. Thank you for joining our first quarter call. CSX had a solid start to 2024 that was in line with our expectations. I've learned that when it comes to routing, it never really is an easy quarter. And this year has already brought us a number of challenges. Thankfully, we have a great ONE CSX team of over 23,000 people. And as you've seen in our weekly volume performance, our railroad has kept moving forward after the early periods of severe weather in January. The latest incident, of course, has been the tragic Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse. CSX had a deep historical relationship with Baltimore and we have important operations there, particularly with our export coal business. We're committed to doing our part to help the city recover. We are happy to see the progress already being made for reopening the port. Later in the call, Mike Cory and Kevin Boone will tell you more about what we are doing now to mitigate the impact of this event for our customers. All that said, we are very pleased with the momentum that we built over the quarter and are seeing in the business today. We knew we had the opportunity to grow our profitability compared to the fourth quarter and we did just that. Our goal was to maintain our strong customer service levels while looking for ways to run the network more efficiently and we have done so. We have more work to do and we are confident in our railroad and are excited about the rest of the year. Now let's start with Slide 1 where we highlight some of the key results from our first quarter. Total volume grew by a solid 3% with strong support from our international -- our intermodal business franchise, which grew at 7% compared to last year. Our operating margin reached 36.8%, which represents a 90 basis point improvement compared to the fourth quarter. Revenue of just under $3.7 billion was about 1% lower than a year ago and flat compared to last quarter. Operating income was 8% lower than last year, but up 3% sequentially. While our earnings per share declined by 4% versus last year, EPS grew by 2% compared to the previous quarter. Now altogether, this was a good first quarter that reflected our solid progress. The entire ONE CSX team knows that there's much more that we can achieve given all the opportunities ahead and the great people we have across the entire railroad. But before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to recognize and remember Jim Foote, who passed away earlier this week. Jim was our President and CEO from late December, 2017, until I arrived in September of 2022. He guided this company through some very challenging and transformative times in our history, including rebuilding the network after the dramatic changes in 2017 and dealing with the COVID pandemic. I had several impactful and insightful conversations with Jim while I was being recruited to come to CSX. And I thank Jim for his support with our Board of Directors to bring an outsider in as CEO of CSX. We thank Jim for all his contributions to CSX and the railroad industry overall throughout his 40-plus year career. And our thoughts and prayers go out to his family and friends. Now let me turn the call over to Mike Cory who has brought a tremendous amount of new energy and new ideas to CSX to discuss our operational performance. All right. Thank you, Sean. Now, we will conclude our remarks by walking through our guidance for the full year 2024, which has not changed. Led by our customer service, we continue to expect total volume and total revenue growth in the low to mid-single-digit range. We expect our merchandise business to gain momentum through the year as effects from new business wins, truck conversions, and the ramp-up of industrial development projects build on a favorable trends in many of our end markets. We look for steady growth in intermodal, supported by stable consumer demand and more normalized retail inventories, which are driving improved port activity. We continue to work closely with our channel partners, finding creative solutions to gain share even as the truck market remains soft. Global benchmark coal prices have fluctuated but remain high compared to history. And though the situation at the port of Baltimore limits some of the export volume in the near term, we are taking actions to effectively mitigate as much of the impact as we can. Our team at Curtis Bay and across the rest of the coal franchise will be ready to ramp back up as quickly as possible once the channel returns to full operation. On profitability, we made good progress this quarter and grew our operation margins -- operating margin sequentially. And as you saw in our results and heard from the team on this call, we benefited from volume growth, solid pricing gains, and focused efforts to improve efficiency and productivity. Our goal is to consistently grow our margins over time. And while Baltimore and global coal prices are near-term challenges, we feel very good about our ability to deliver strong incremental performance in the second half of this year. There is no change to our CapEx forecast of $2.5 billion. And as you heard from Sean, our balanced opportunistic approach to capital returns remains in place. To conclude, during the quarter, where there were many potential distractions, I am very proud of how the ONE CSX team stuck to our plan, focused on execution, prioritized our customers, and achieved good results. There is much more to come as we make every effort to run safer, faster, and more reliably for our customers so we can deliver profitable growth over the long term. Thanks to all of your interest in the company and, Matthew, we're ready to take questions. This is Joe. Just to add one more comment. So we'll work hard to try and help tell our story a little bit better and differently going forward. But I just want to be clear, our focus on the customer and customer service have not waned at all. And as you heard Kevin mention in his comments, we get surveys from our customers on a regular basis, and we have the best score that we've ever had in the first quarter. So we have to find a way to tell the story that isn't just told by velocity and dwell or even trip plan compliance. That's why we introduced the customer switch data and some other things. For example, our tonnage went up for train. And so if we combine a train, two trains to one, maybe we go from three engines to two engines, on being used in that combination and that higher tonnage train might be a little slower and might tell a little more dwell time, but the customer is okay with it. It helps our efficiency and the customer is still happy. And so -- but that will show up as little more dwell and a little less velocity but better efficiency. And as long as the customer is happy, we're okay. So we check with the customer first and then we work backwards, as opposed to some of the stories you've heard in the past, which was about our internal focus and then tell the customer about it later. That's a very unique and important difference and distinction. But importantly, as you saw quarter-over-quarter, while some of our numbers may look like they degraded, but our efficiency got better and our customer responses and survey responses were the best we ever had. So we're walking that fine line. So we're going to have to find a way to help you guys see that, and at the same time, getting more efficient. And working with our employees as ONE CSX team to teach them how to do that and work together to do that in a positive way. And that's the balance we're trying to do, and I appreciate Mike and his entire operations team working with Kevin and the sales and marketing team to bring that to life, and it's a collaborative effort. And it's worked because it's teaching. It's also listening, is finding creative solutions and not being focused on one metric. And at the end of the day, we can deliver sequential improvements. And so as long as we deliver sequential improvement to our customers and in our earnings, we can show you how that it leads to growth over time. Thanks. Thanks, Bascome. This is Joe. As you know, certainly in the time frame that I've been here with this ONE CSX team, we've been really focused on our mission, which is really to focus on improving the employee culture and the employee experience through ONE CSX and to get better service to our customers, which we believe will lead to profitable growth for ourselves and importantly, growth with our customers. That hasn't changed and hasn't waned. I think in fact, what you've seen over the last couple of months is customers coming out and wanting that commitment to service and that commitment to -- for our whole industry to be focused on what can we do to grow. So we're not distracted by what's going on and certainly not getting distracted by it. We're focused on what we can do, and as you saw in the quarter sequential improvement across the Board, and we talked about our confidence in to be able to continue to deliver that. And that's what I'm really proud of our team, is not getting distracted and staying focused on our customers, on our employees. We need to improve safety, as Mike talked about and looking for opportunities to grow. And what we're hearing from customers, they're very happy with the service CSX is providing, and they're very pleased with the continuity and the consistency of our messaging, but also our results, interactions. And that's what we want to stay focused on. At the higher level, as you hinted at, as an industry, we have to continue to get better service to our customers. I talked about it extensively at many different conferences and events, and we're all working together to do that. I'm seeing more collaboration across the industry to make that happen, and I'm encouraged by that, and we want to be a part of that. And so to ultimately realize the potential of this entire industry, we all need to get better, at the fluidity of our network, how we work together and the service we provide to our customers. And that's going to take us working better with all the stakeholders in this industry to help make that happen. So we can grow as industry if and when we all get better at customer service and working together. So that's the focus we have at CSX. You're not going to see us change our -- there's no 2.0 or 3.0, 4.0 plan. It's the same ONE CSX, focusing on our employees and our customers, and you're going to see us continue to execute. Thanks. And Joe, Kevin and I have -- sorry, Kevin and I have spent, I don't know how many customers we've met with in the last couple of months, but we've had an FDA and a number of other events. I think we've touched almost every major customer we have and directly personally. And we've seen a lot of -- gotten a lot of feedback on the consistency, reliability and the continuity of our messaging and also our actions.

            "name": "Kevin Boone",
            "content": "All right, thank you, Mike, and good afternoon everyone. The team continues to build momentum with our customers, targeting modal share conversion and quickly bringing solutions to the market that target profitable growth. Our ability to react quickly and provide solutions for our customers was highlighted by our efforts in Baltimore, where we rapidly stood up an alternative solution to meet the intermodal needs of the community. Despite a continuing weak truck market, the team has done a great job focusing on developing new opportunities, including truck to rail conversion, industrial development, working closer with our rail partners to identify joint opportunities and accelerating strategic discussions that allow our customers to benefit from our best-in-class service. Communication and collaboration between sales and marketing and operations is a key differentiator for CSX. Our recent voice of the customer survey results for the first quarter shows the highest service scores since we began the survey, which highlights the positive trajectory that we are on. Let's turn to Slide 7 to look at our merchandise performance. Our merchandise revenues were up 1% compared to last year with flat volumes and a 1% increase in RPU as contract renewals and slightly favorable mix more than offset the effect of lower fuel surcharge. Across the business lines, automotive accelerated nicely after a slow start at several manufacturing plants. Chemicals, our largest market continues to gain momentum in plastics, food, and NGLs. Forest product volumes were flat overall but saw encouraging signs in pull board and building products as the construction season appears to be off to a stronger start. We told you that minerals face a tough comparison for aggregates, which were unseasonably strong in the first quarter of 2023. But total demand is very strong against a healthy backlog of large construction projects with infrastructure spending expected to accelerate. Metals volumes were a bit weaker year-over-year with the weather affecting flows in certain scrap markets. Finished steel has also been a bit sluggish, but we see opportunity for sequential improvement in the back half of the year. Fertilizer volumes continue to be unimpacted by phosphate production issues here in Florida, but an early application season in certain markets supported demand for longer-haul, higher-yield shipments of potash and other fertilizers, which lifted our RPU. Finally, our ag and food business remains relatively soft, constrained by a strong global soybean supplies, which limit demand for US exports and still high availability of local crops in many of our customer regions. Underlying demand across grains, feed, and food products is solid and we're optimistic challenging conditions will normalize into the back half of the year. Turning to Slide 8. For the first quarter, coal revenue was flat year-over-year as 2% volume growth was offset by a 2% decline in all-in RPU, largely due to fuel surcharge. Our benchmark-based export yields were slightly lower compared to last year, but we also got some benefit from favorable mix on the domestic side. As expected, shipments reflected the strength in export markets with export tonnage up 25% year-over-year. It really is a testament to the great work by the team, including the credible work by operations to meet the increased demand. We also anticipated that the domestic market would be challenged by low natural gas prices and lapping last year's restocking demand. Domestic shipments for the quarter were down 17% against a very tough comparison in the first quarter of 2023. With Baltimore and the effects of the collapse of the Key Bridge, I'm going to stress how important our partnership is with the city. As Joe noted before, we have a long history with Baltimore, going back to the very beginning of our railroad. And the ONE CSX team is working hard to find alternative solutions to help the community and our customers. In terms of the revenue impact to CSX, export coal will see a near-term headwind with both our Curtis Bay facility and the dual-serve console marine terminal that are unable to load vessels. Two days following the incident, Joe and I joined senior leadership from CSX to visit key alternative export facilities. We have already begun to divert a portion of our Baltimore volumes to other outlets. Currently, we estimate that the net revenue impact to CSX from the port closure is between $25 million and $30 million per month, including the benefit of diverting some of these tons. It's still very early in the remediation process, but the Army Corps of Engineers has projected that the full channel depth, which we need for coal vessels to be reopened by the end of May. It's also likely that you see a good amount of congestion immediately after reopening, but there's potential for it to take a few weeks to ramp back up to full run rate. In the meantime, we are studying in communication with our customers, business partners, state, local, and federal authorities. We are working closely with Mike and his team to make sure we are optimizing all available resources to serve our customers as successfully as possible. Turning the intermodal on Slide 9. Revenue increased 1% on 7% volume growth. Lower fuel surcharge and negative mix pulled our RPU lower by 5%. Growth was very strong for our international business as healthy consumer demand and more normalized inventories have supported higher import levels. We saw volumes increase year-over-year with many of our shipping partners as we gained from new contracts, new lanes, and a comparison with last year's weak market conditions. We are very encouraged by the recovery we are seeing and continued positive demand signals as we look over the rest of the year. Our domestic intermodal business also grew over the quarter at a more moderate pace than what we've seen over the last couple of quarters. What's been constant is our service performance, which continues to help us win new business and drive truck conversion even as the weak truck market conditions persist. We're optimistic that truck capacity will normalize in time, even benefit the intermodal market. More importantly, we are confident that we will be prepared when the demand rebounds. Finally, let's turn to Slide 10, where we have an update on our industrial development program. Our project pipeline remains strong with hundreds of companies eager to partner with us to find attractive ways to expand their production capacity on rail surf sites. Something that's often overlooked is how diverse these development projects really are. The chart on left shows the market split. Based on potential carload volume or the approximately 100 facilities that have come online over the last 12 months, these new sites and expansions represent $4.2 billion in total capital investment and have added new capacity in many of our key markets such as chemicals, minerals and forest products. But this is only scratching the surface. The chart on the right shows the market split for the full development pipeline ranging from projects we anticipate starting up later this year to project proposals that will be constructed several years from now. There are two key takeaways from this forward-looking view. First, the total estimated potential carload opportunity measured by expected capacity implies a meaningful acceleration in activity as we look-forward. Scopes can change and timelines can shift, but the setup is very encouraging for meaningful growth contribution over multiple years. Second, the long-term pipeline is also diverse. We are excited about the multiple electric vehicle manufacturing facilities that are scheduled to come online over the next several years. When combined together with related raw material or battery facilities, they represent approximately 12% of the total long-term volume potential. Minerals, metals, chemicals and other projects represent larger contributors. This is a big opportunity for CSX and our industrial development team has been working non-stop to build the partnerships that make all of this possible. We're excited to tell you that there's much more to come. With that, let me turn it off -- let me hand it over to Sean. Thank you. Yeah, Tom. Nothing has changed on the pricing side. We're obviously a tough truck backdrop. That will improve and we'll see a lot of benefits from that I think, as we see the cycle hopefully has bottomed here from what we're seeing. But I -- when you look at-the market, what we do on the pricing side is obviously, we're able to capture that inflation and I don't see anything really changing there. It's always a balance and we manage the portfolio accordingly. And where there's opportunities, obviously to gain more-and-more volume, we work with our customers, but it's a core to what we -- how our growth algorithm works. It's volume and price as we look at it and nothing has changed there. As hopefully cost inflation comes down, then the customers will benefit from that going-forward. But obviously, not the environment that we had last year where inflation was very-high, that's starting to moderate some. Hopefully, the Fed gets a big-picture too and with the rates and things like that, but that's where we are today. Still as planned, I think I was very happy with what the results in the first-quarter, what the team was able to deliver, and we're right on-track. Yeah. I mean, look, we're in the very early stages of this. And when the facility comes online, there's usually -- depending on the industry, a 12- to 24-month ramp, right? And so for this year, for example, we have in the aggregate side, really on the metal side as well as where we've seen some concentration in that activity as we look forward. You can see where the activity is going to take place. But these projects, some of them longer than others. But once they come online, there's really a guide path of growth, as related to that as we bring that capacity on and enter the market. So -- we're excited about it. I think we'll share a lot more as the year progresses on and give you a lot more detail on how that layers in over time. But we thought we'd give a little more color just around how diverse that pipeline is and how it continues to build. And I think that's exciting to have diversity around. We're not concentrated in one single industry. It's really -- we're seeing it across the board in the markets that we serve. Yeah. I think just looking at last week, not that we live week to week, this is going to be a little bit choppy with some of the terminals we're working with in terms of taking on some additional capacity. I don't think last week necessarily the trend that we're seeing, we're seeing some good performance and then stepping up here this week on that. But when you look at the impact, I explained $25 million to $30 million net impact from the Baltimore incident, that will continue at least through May, and then we'll probably have a hopefully glide path end of June of improving that. But we're looking at offsetting a third of that business, maybe a little bit more if we can get all of the terminals to work with us. Look, I think, obviously, the comps on the International side were fairly easy in the first quarter. That's where we saw some pretty dramatic declines last year, as you saw destocking happening almost across the board in a lot of companies out there. So we benefited from that. The team has done an amazing job of identifying new services, some other areas, that identified some profitable growth that we went after, good contract relationships. We're aligned with the right partners, and we benefited from that. So you've seen double-digit growth on our international side, while our domestic was slightly up this past quarter and the domestic market is a lot more truck competitive, as we all know. And if you've been listening the last couple of days, it hasn't been -- the trucking companies have obviously struggled, and I think we're pretty proud of the results we were able to put up in that context. We think there's better days ahead, but certainly a challenging market and the results were good in that context for sure. Yeah. Thanks, Jason. Look, there's still a value proposition out there. Was it a little bit tighter than maybe a year ago when truck prices were a lot healthier? Absolutely. And I think the discussion is more about when you look at it, what can add value in the near term. I mean when you have to do nothing and you get price declines in your trucking business, then you're not as compelled to look at the intermodal option as you would be in a more normalized market. And so I think that all probably balances out as we get it through the year. It feels like we're at the bottom, bouncing along here. And as things solidify, I think those conversations accelerate. We've put up domestic growth, and we're pretty proud of that. The product that we're offering, the service that we're offering is compelling in the market even at these lows, and I can only imagine how compelling it's going to be as the market recovers. So we're pretty excited about it. We're talking about it actively as a group of when the growth comes back, that we're going to be prepared more than anybody else to handle it. So that's exciting for us. When that recovery happens, we're not certain, I think it's fair to say the trucking market is probably a little bit worse than what people anticipated coming into the year, but we were pretty resilient in a very, very challenging market. I'll cover the revenue one. That one's easy. It's coal that we're seeing there, maybe some slight opportunities, but they're not large enough to be impactful to that number. On the cost side, Mike. I just want to tell you guys a little story because I get often asked all the time, what are the benefits of ONE CSX and the culture we're trying to achieve here. Within two days of the incident in Baltimore, we put out a request for transfers from our engineers and conductors, who were in our locations to be able to relocate temporarily for a couple of months to help with the change in the train setup and schedule we needed to support the movement of coal elsewhere. And we needed maybe a dozen people to go, and we had seven, eight times that people immediately sign up to help. And that's a testament to what we're seeing here is that our people are willing to be a part of the solution and to serve our customers and know how important that is. And that's just a great example. So there's a little bit of cost of that relocation and a temporary transfer. But I can tell you, a little over a year ago, we were trying to get temporary transfers, and we struggled. And this time, we have so many people signed up, it was great to see. And those are the signs you want to see of a healthy culture and people are really service oriented, but also understand the bigger picture of what we're trying to do here in serving our customers. And so we have not been the constraint or the bottleneck at all. In fact, we've been able to really -- Kevin and I were with one of our largest coal customers the other day and he was just so proud of the work we've done and our team has done to respond so quickly and be able to react, and that's a testament to our people. That's just another example of why it's so important to stay consistently focused on our culture and our people and help them understand that we're here to serve customers, and that's why we exist to do it safely, obviously, and efficiently, but that message is resonating and our people are responding. Look, I think we said roughly half of our business touches another railroad. And certainly, when you look at the Western railroads, particularly UP, they are a very large part of that. So they're a very important partner to us. All of our partners are very important. So it's encouraging to hearing a lot of signs to go after more business, and we're working collaboratively to do that. So a lot of opportunities out there that we see. Yeah. Look, in terms of pent-up demand, there's outages in the summer that happened for the coal miners and we'll see how they handle that with some of the obviously, slowdown that we've seen. Is there opportunity to make up to this volume in the third and fourth quarter? There is. That's not in the plan right now, but we'll see how that plays out. The prices remain strong. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of incentive to meet those contractual obligations and those things. On the East Coast, West Coast, look, if you've been to Savannah lately, there's huge, huge investments going on in investments. Obviously, when you're spending billions of dollars, you've got to have visibility to the demand out there and -- there's tremendous demand that they see coming. And we're not hearing any anticipation of significant trade moving from the east to west. Obviously, if that happened and they want to move to the East, there could be a net benefit to us. So I think from our perspective, it's probably a neutral outcome if that happened. And in some cases, you could see some business that normally would come into the ports and move truck that would come over the less than move over our railroad, which would be an incremental opportunity for us. So I don't see a high probability to risk there, maybe some more opportunities if that happens, but we'll continue to watch it. But over the long term, we see a lot of capacity growth in the East, and it's just not there in the West. I think generally, there's a lot of geopolitical risk out there. There's a lot of movement in terms of how companies post the pandemic are thinking about their supply chains. And we talked about this before, but a supply -- their supply chains are being viewed as competitive advantages and being closer to your end consumer, which we have the most valuable consumers in our network in the world, it's becoming a priority, and we're seeing those investments take place to really happen. So it's broad based, as I mentioned, a lot of activity, but I think that's the major draw. I think they saw through the pandemic, a lot of disruption with how much it costs to get things delivered to the end consumers. So now it provides an opportunity where we can maybe get the inbound and the outbound, which is pretty exciting for us. So it will happen over time. There's already a lot of capital on the ground, a lot of the capital that's already been spent. So we'll participate in that. But it's a really shift from what we've seen probably over the last three or four decades, in terms of activity. And rather than the industrial base decaying within our network, we see some growth in that industrial base, which should benefit us over time. Look, I mean, I've seen more activity with our customers willing us to share us their truck files to really open up the book in terms of what their supply chain looks like, given some of the service performance we've been able to achieve over the last few quarters. So that's exciting for us. We're really looking internally about what we can deliver. I think customers want certainty and they want visibility. And I think we're providing that. They understand the path we're on. They're supportive of that path, and they're seeing the service along with it. So we had many customers last year, say, hey, we want to see the service and then we can talk about more opportunities for you. And now we're in the midst of a lot of those discussions, and it's -- the team is working really hard. The backdrop, the wind is not at our back. Clearly, we have a lot of markets that are at cyclical lows. Those will come back. But the opportunity right now is to win wallet share. And as you win wallet share and the markets turn, that would translate into a lot of growth for us. So incredibly excited. We're internally focused on what we can accomplish those discussions, what we can deliver. And I think we're having a lot of those conversations."

            "name": "Sean Pelkey",
            "content": "Thank you, Kevin, and good afternoon. First quarter revenue fell by 1%, while operating income was down 8% or $110 million. These results include a number of discrete items versus the prior year with approximately $140 million of impacts from last year's insurance recovery, changes in net fuel, as well as declines in other revenue and export coal pricing. Across merchandise coal and intermodal, revenue excluding fuel recovery increased 4% in the quarter, benefiting from 3% volume growth and strong pricing across the merchandise portfolio. Expenses were 4% higher and I will discuss the line items in more detail on the next slide. Underlying results reflect continued momentum generated by the ONE CSX team, both in our service-driven top-line performance and broad-based cost-control and efficiency initiatives. Q1 was our second consecutive quarter of sequential operating income growth despite a $30 million net fuel headwind relative to Q4. In addition, sequential operating margins grew nearly 100 basis points, demonstrating this team's focus on growth and efficient service performance. This momentum positions us well to deliver year-over-year gains in the back half of 2024. Interest and other expense was $9 million higher compared to the prior year, while income tax expense fell $25 million on lower pretax earnings net of a slightly higher effective rate. As a result, earnings per share decreased $0.02, including $0.05 of impact from the previously mentioned discrete items. Let's now turn to the next slide and take a closer look at expenses. Total first quarter expense increased by $85 million. Turning to the individual line items, labor and fringe increased $75 million, mostly impacted by inflation, higher headcount, costs from union employees' sick pay, and higher incentive compensation. Even so, cost per employee was down versus the fourth quarter, and we expect cost per employee to again be favorable sequentially in Q2. Total headcount should remain stable despite higher seasonal volumes. Purchase services and other expense increased $23 million, which includes a $46 million impact from a prior year insurance recovery. Efficiency gains evident on this line represent significant cross-functional collaboration to drive sustainable cost improvements across both operating and overhead budgets. We expect this momentum to continue going forward. Depreciation was up $17 million due to a larger asset base. Fuel cost was down $39 million, mostly driven by a lower gallon price. Progress continued in fuel efficiency, which improved year-over-year and saw smaller than normal seasonal degradation from Q4, despite severe winter weather earlier in the quarter. Finally, equipment and rents increased by $2 million, while property gains were unfavorable by $7 million. Now turning to cash flow and distributions on Slide 14, free cash flow of $560 million is lower year-to-date, driven by a decrease in net earnings, increased investment in the business, and deferred tax payments, partially offset by prior year back wage payouts. CSX exits Q1 with a healthy balance sheet and an A-rated credit profile. Our first priority remains investing capital towards safety, reliability, and long-term growth. CSX also distributed nearly $500 million to shareholders, split between share repurchases and dividends, demonstrating our balanced but opportunistic approach to returning excess cash. We also believe a long-term focus on economic profit aligns our interest with that of our shareholders. While first-quarter economic profit declined due to previously mentioned discrete headwinds, we expect it to increase over time as we efficiently convert freight off the highway while maintaining strong asset utilization and attractive returns on our capital spending. Now with that, let me turn it back to Joe for his closing remarks. Hey, Justin, happy to take both of those questions. So yeah, in terms of sequential improvement, that's normally what we see from Q1 to Q2. While clearly, the Baltimore impact is going to be felt in the second quarter, we still feel that we should be able to grow earnings sequentially from Q1 to Q2. And what I would say is, that's both top-line as well as being able to do it while containing costs and deliver really strong incremental margins from Q1 to Q2. The headwind clearly is export coal, not just the Baltimore impact, but in terms of RPU, I think pricing has come down. What we're seeing right now in the marketplace is probably something that's going to lead to a mid-to-high single-digit decline in coal RPU from Q1 to Q2. But even with that backdrop, still feel pretty good about our ability to continue this momentum. Sure, Brian. Yeah. So on the headcount side, I would say we came into the year, we actually added a little bit from Q4 to Q1. Most of that was for the engineering work that Mike talked about and making sure that we could get everything done this year. We're going to manage that down through attrition. As we get to the second half of the year, we're going to watch business levels. We're going to see how we're running. But I think it's fair to assume that we're going to be relatively stable as we get to the second half, if not down a little bit sequentially. And so you're going to see a clear return to headcount labor productivity in the second half of the year. And then in terms of comp per employee, yep, second quarter will be another step down versus Q1. A couple of reasons for that. One is, first quarter, we had some winter-related costs. And then secondly, as some of the capital-related programs get a little more ramped up in the second quarter that has a benefit to cost per employee sequentially Q2 versus Q1. And then you're right, as we get to the second half of the year, the current labor agreement stipulates a 4.5% union wage increase. So we'll feel the impact of that as we go from second quarter into the second half. Thanks, Mike. Yeah. And what he says is true. We're focused on how do we deliver growth and how do we do it at strong incremental margins by maintaining the fixed cost profile and not adding a whole lot of variable costs along the way. If not finding opportunities where we can run things more efficiently. So to your direct question about cost ex fuel, I think, yeah, it's fair to assume we got a chance to improve that even further going from Q1 to Q2. And that ties in with the comments I just made about comp per employee and keeping headcount relatively flat. So we'll build some momentum. I think the year-over-year comps are a little more difficult in Q2 given the Baltimore impacts. If that hadn't happened, maybe could have even grown operating income and margin in the second quarter. But with it, it makes it more challenging. Second half of the year, we feel good about the setup. Some of these headwinds that we're facing, the first couple of quarters paid. And we're going to have labor productivity. We'll continue to grow the business. The industrial development projects Kevin talked about, a number of those start to come on as we get a little bit later into the year. So there's a lot to like about it. We are not going to give any specific guidance about full year operating income growth, margin growth. But clearly, sticking with the low to mid-single-digit total volume and revenue growth is very helpful, particularly when we're focused on what we can do to drive continued efficiency gains. Amit, it's Sean. I'll take the first part. Yeah, profit up Q2 versus Q1 and margins up. I think that's a fair expectation on both sides. Yeah, Walter, I'll do my best on that one. So yeah, I mean, certainly, a little bit of winter in January, couple of things there. And then, of course, the Baltimore outage was unexpected, and that's a hit to the forecast. But still feel very confident about what the second half looks like, in particular, from a volume and revenue perspective and what it looks like on the cost side. We did an exercise here where we looked at every dollar of every budget and there's a lot of small wins that we're getting here, just $1 million, $2 million here and there across every line item, both within operations and across the business. So I think it's everybody focused on how do we deliver the kind of economic financial performance that sort of backs up all the momentum that we've got with ONE CSX, the goodwill that we've got with the customer. And to the extent there's revenue headwinds, how do we close the gap on some of those, but still a lot of confidence, I think, from the CSX team. Thanks, Stephanie. It's Sean. We're still committed to the share repurchase as well as the dividend. It's certainly a step down in the first quarter of the year, but we -- the stock ran up pretty quickly. And so we try to be opportunistic and gauge the amount of buybacks that we do based on the momentum in the stock. So with the pullback that we've had recently, we're buying a little bit more. Still committed to do a significant amount of share repurchases this year. It will be a little bit less than it was last year, just simply because we came into the year with a little bit less cash on the balance sheet. And last year, we raised a little bit of incremental debt to help juice the system, and that led to some additional buybacks, but we're still very committed to that, and you'll see it go up and down quarter-to-quarter just based on the opportunity that we have in the market."

            "name": "Mike Cory",
            "content": "Yeah, thank you, Joe, and thanks for everybody for taking the time to be with us today. So let's look at the first slide on safety. While we found improvement in the FRA train accident rate year-over-year, in my view, our overall performance results in this quarter pale in comparison to what this team is capable and will deliver. So as a team we've begun to really work collectively to elevate and integrate the beliefs and actions that a strong safety culture requires. We recognize that in order to successively change our safety performance, we need different and better skills. This includes proactive risk identification for our employees and their supervisors. And we thoroughly investigate every incident to determine the root cause and the necessary follow-ups for any recurrence. And we pass that information on to our employees through portals to ensure the information is shared, learned from, and used in improving everything from training to oversight of all our employees. [Technical Difficulty] employees in both the union and their management provide a key opportunity to build a strong safety culture. We're starting to partner with our union leaders to help us change risk tolerances across our property. And this partnership is starting to provide real benefit toward creating a strong safety culture. This takes time and effort on all sides, but I'm very pleased with our progress so far. We're also listening to our employees' suggestions and we're applying it to our safety plan in order to become more responsive to our customers' needs in a safe and efficient way. Let's look at the next slide. And looking at this slide, you're going to see our standard velocity and dwell metrics that I'm sure we'll talk about today. Our focus this quarter has been on providing strong customer service while controlling costs. And while we've seen a slight decrease in velocity and an increase in dwell, our train sizes have grown in line with the increase in volume we've handled for our customers year-over-year. Crew starts have remained flat with GTMs up 1.5% and carloads up 3%. Our cost focus also includes management of the large capital program we have our engineering crews working on. And we're focused on making sure they have enough time for the work to be done properly. As a result, our crews are accomplishing all of their scheduled work and are also gaining efficiency. In both [tie] (ph) and rails, we've seen reductions in unit costs, good reductions. As we've enforced stricter compliance with planned track time for crews, we've seen slight decreases in velocity increases as well. Our intent is to build and execute a more inclusive plan that provides the right work window while minimizing loss of velocity. And I expect to see improvement as we continue to refine and develop this plan for the rest of this year cycle and beyond. Our focus on cost has also identified some strategic locations that are not as productive as they could be. We see cost saving opportunities by reconfiguring and strategically utilizing these assets into our operating plan. This will reduce cars running out of route and excess handlings, and our customers will benefit as we increase speed and open up capacity in one of the corridors. And that's the most important part. It is we make these changes to our operation. There's no change to our goal of servicing the customer the best way we can. Having an efficient network that can consistently perform to our customers needs will allow us to gain share, and build business from truck and attract new customers to rail. Over to the next slide. On this slide, you're going to see some of our customer service metrics, which still remains strong. Intermodal trip plan compliance remains high. Truck drive return times and arrival to availability, which is a measure of efficiency at the yard, has also improved as we collaborate with our customers to improve the experience of their terminals. As an example, our Fairburn terminal, southeast of Atlanta, is a critical asset for our domestic intermodal business, but has not performed to our customers' needs as well as our expectations. Our intermodal leader put together a team and they developed better process for use of both the footprint and the assets, in turn creating fluidity that has reduced driver dwell at Fairburn by nearly 50% in recent weeks compared to earlier in the year and previous to that. This leads to capacity and more opportunity for conversion from truck. Our carload trip compliance declined slightly, but remained over 80% for the quarter and has improved in the first month of Q2. We're very proud of the service that our customers experience with CSX. To show this, we've added another important metric to this slide, and that's customer switch data, which represents our reliability to be able to deliver on our commitments at the first and last mile of service for our customers and most of our short-line partners. As you can see, this remains very high. In closing, we have many opportunities ahead of us. The team is focused on creating a climate of success for all involved. Our focus on safety, service, and efficiency won't waver as we continue to provide the best service product we can for our customers. With that, over to you Kevin. Yeah, sure, John. Thank you very much for the questions. But I just want to make it really loud and clear. These metrics are extremely important. We're not happy with them. They're not significant, and I'll put it in perspective here. So some of the -- we really shocked the system. And one of the first things we did was really start to look at the efficiency of our capital -- engineering capital programs for $1.5 billion envelope. And quite frankly, last year we didn't get the work done and we paid more than we should have for the work that we got done. So this year we decided that we were going to be very strict about the curfews. And those are anytime the track is out and either for between six and 10 hours across our network for these big giant gangs to get out there and do all their work with rail ties, bridges, you name it. And again, we started this probably around -- you can see the dip probably around early February, late January, because it was after the winter started. But after we went through the winter storms and it really impacted our southern corridors. We stuck to our guns. We held our trains at the terminals to run in line with the curfew that dwells the cars in the yard that also congests and bunches up traffic. And so we really let that go for a month. But then we've been working ever since that point to start to redefine the program that we're doing, split up the work. And one thing we really did before was do all the work in the south during the winter time, because of the winter up north. We've got to find ways and we will to spread the work out. But that in itself caused a fluctuation in train speed from previous years because we did not be that strict. We've come in under our rail and tie budget. So everything unit cost wise is the right way. But the biggest thing it provides that safety -- that safety hardening of the track that we need to do every year with the volume we move. That's number one. If you remember, we went into last quarter, we reduced 5% of our crew starts and we absorbed [1.5%] (ph) GTMs, 3% carloads, whatever you want to call it, without any more change in headcount. What that did was really focuses on increasing the tonnage on the train. That then starts to convert itself to better utilization of locomotives. Something as simple as going from three to two. Those things start to slow the trains. But they're still within an acceptable parameter. And as far as I am concerned right now, it's not where we want to be, though. On top of that, we really took a strict view on our use of trip optimizer. And that's really there to moderate the speed of the train, but again, get its fuel efficiency. We increased our use by over 10% this quarter. So we did all this over the backdrop of a typical first quarter. If you look last year, the numbers came down as well. And then you get whether you want to call it winter. They're excuses, but these things on top of that, I'm comfortable with all the actions we're taking that we will figure out a better way to do the work blocks. But at the same time, this is forcing the folks in our terminals that you don't have as many outlets at times to move their cars. And so we're working through that. In fact, it got to the point now where in going through this exercise, we started to identify some yards that were closed for the right reason, I shouldn't say closed, but they were disconfigured. I'm not talking about opening up pumps, but there's some strategic yards that we're going to look at using as we go forward that I'm looking at quite a few out of road car miles, handlings, all the good stuff that produces more speed, but at a reduced cost. And we don't find that until you start to push the program. We could have easily just absorbed traffic, put some more trains on. PSR is not running the speed. PSR is providing the proper service at the right cost and being able to incrementally grow your margins and grow your business. And so that's really what's going on. I see improvement in the future. I see it every day. I see the engagement of our folks. This has also provided a real opportunity for us to teach our operating supervisors how to balance. As Sean said earlier, there's a lot of cost in everywhere we look on this railway. Obviously, the biggest is labor and fuel, and that's what we're tackling. But this is teaching them how to go about this exercise without at the end sacrificing customer service. And one dwell number we don't show is our arrival to placement for our customers. It's improved 10% in many of the major industrial areas. The reason for that is we have actually increased our local service. We've taken some of the money we saved on the liner although we make sure we're trying to build trust with our customers, because now the next opportunity -- one of the next opportunities to look at their fleets and get them to work with us, to trust us, to be there like we are and hopefully reduce some of the fleet that we have out there and still add more incremental business onto what we have. I hope that answers it, but there's a plan behind this. Thank you. Thank you, Scott. I'm going to let the expert over here, Sean, talk about margin because as you know, I never talk about margin. But your theories are right, like, we're trying to balance without first of all, safety and the customer without damaging that and we have a long way to go on safety. So these things -- that these things we're looking at are all focused on really on the cost side. So whether if we can shift some of the capital that we're planning to use by being more productive into other areas that we hadn't planned and make some of these yards useful or more useful than they are, I see definite cost benefit. It's things like that. It's not something -- Sean is looking at me, he's going to start talking a bit about the numbers. But really, that is our focus to bring that margin up on the cost side. But I'll turn it over to Scott -- to Sean. Yeah, Ken. That's a good question. I almost -- I thought I explained earlier. I'm not -- I can't give you an answer so much on when do we expect to see the service improve because the service is good. Like, we -- I expect to see over the next few quarters here, yeah, the velocity and dwell will continue to improve versus what they are. But the service level is going to be what the customer needs. And right now, that's what we're fulfilling. But -- so again, we're going to do a lot of different things here to test our facilities, our people that put -- we're trying to put stricter process in place. And that's going to have some effect until we learn to get through it. But I see the metrics improving. I see them now improving. It's just we still have -- we still have the odd thing that's taking place and lots of it's revolved around these engineering gangs that we are full hearted, like our full engineering team plus our operating, our transportation team are meeting as we speak, to continue to find a way to not have such restricted curfews, but we have to do. Other than that, the network is fluid. And I'll let Kevin talk about Baltimore and what we are doing with the shifting to Newport. Yeah. And I think Kevin alluded to it, we had a little bit of a rough start-up going over to Newport and that's now smoothed itself out. But really not a lot more cost then. The -- most of the traffic moves through, other than the [point of coal] (ph). So not significant in that sense, no. And just one more point, Ben, I should mention this is. With this issue, we've been able to get a betterment in terms of our maintenance at Curtis Bay. We've been able to go in there and do work that we would have had to do it under load with a lot of volume moving through. So we've fully taken advantage of some pretty major restoration that we were able to accomplish that we're still working on. So that's been a good thing."
