And now I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteven Huffman: Thanks Jesse. Hey everyone, thank you for joining and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm excited to share that Q3 was a landmark quarter for Reddit. We averaged over 97 million DA UQ, an increase of 47% from last year. And for the first time, we exceeded 100 million DA UQ a few times during the quarter, which has been a longstanding milestone for us. Our Q3 revenue grew 68% year-over-year, and I'm proud to announce that we also achieved GAAP profitability. Reddit's influence continues to grow across the broader Internet. In 2024, so far, the word Reddit was the sixth most Googled word in the United States, underscoring that when people are looking for answers, advice or community, they seek out Reddit specifically. We saw this play out in real time when the White House came to Reddit to share critical information during the recent hurricanes, they used our Reddit Pro tools to identify the right communities to reach people affected by these events. In fact, thousands of businesses are now using Reddit Pro, including the MLB and NFL. We're using it to share exclusive content with communities. We continue to see more businesses and organizations come to Reddit to find their audience. We remain focused on making Reddit the best place on the Internet for conversations and community, which means, quite simply, we're continuously improving the user experience by making discovery easier, making the platform faster and smarter, enabling seamless contribution and simplifying moderation. A few highlights from the quarter include our conversation pages, conversation page views exceeded 90 billion, growing 40% year-over-year in Q3 as users are getting into the conversations faster and more often. We refreshed the Ask Me Anything or AMA product, which led to a fivefold increase in the number of AMAs created in the new format. And we launched better tools for posting that have both increased posts and reduced moderator removals, which makes a better experience for everybody. And as for growing beyond the United States, our efforts here are proving successful. International DAU grew 44% year-over-year, led by 53% growth in our focus markets, most notably in France, India and the Philippines. This year we started using AI to translate Reddit's corpus into other languages, making it more accessible for non-English speakers to enjoy in their native languages. After promising results with French in the first half of this year, we expanded our coverage to include Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German. This quarter, machine translation drove four times more users than last quarter, and based on the success we've seen so far, we plan to expand machine translation to over 30 countries through 2025. As Reddit becomes a truly global platform, we are focused on ensuring everyone, regardless of their language, can participate in and benefit from the communities on Reddit. Looking ahead, improving the search experience on Reddit is a key part of our strategy. We want to ensure that all users have the best experience possible. This includes users coming to Reddit from external search and those searching directly on Reddit who are looking for recommendations on what to buy, what to watch, or what products or services are the best. We know many users are looking for more than just answers. They are looking for authentic real-world insights and advice from the communities on Reddit. So, we're focused on making the experience of finding relevant conversations and content on Reddit easier and more intuitive. Continuing to look to 2025 and beyond, we'll seek opportunities to accelerate our roadmap, whether through new product developments, global expansion, or growing our ads business, all while maintaining our commitment to scaling profitably and ensuring that Reddit continues to be the go-to place for conversations and community on the Internet. Thank you again for being a part of this exciting journey with us. I'll now hand it over to Jen.\nJennifer Wong: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. It was a strong quarter for Reddit as our unique proposition and core platform improvements are driving differentiated growth. Total revenue in Q3 grew 68% year-over-year to $348.4 million. The advertising business grew 56% year-over-year to $315.1 million driven by strong growth across objectives, channels, verticals and geographies. Let me discuss our ad revenue drivers in more detail. We saw strong year-over-year growth in impressions from higher user growth, more efficient ad load and expansion of conversation placement ads, while pricing was mostly consistent with the prior year. Revenue across the funnel accelerated year-over-year. We continue to deliver more value to our customers by improving ad performance, particularly in the middle and lower funnel, which is 2/3 of our road map. Performance revenue from mid- and lower funnel objectives drove more than half the growth in the quarter and accounted for about 60% of total advertising revenue. We more than doubled the number of clicks this quarter as we continue to enhance our lower funnel capabilities. We saw continued momentum across channels. The scaled business, including mid-market and SMB customers, grew over 80% year-over-year and continues to be an area of investment. This was largely driven by managed clients where we provide service. We saw strength across verticals led by auto, consumer goods, financial services and pharmaceuticals, all adding new clients and lines of business in Q3 and total international revenue grew 57% year-over-year as we saw strength in the EMEA markets across both large and midsized customers. In our ad stack, we continue to focus on: number one, driving performance of our ad solutions across the funnel; two, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity for our sales force; and three, offering our advertisers Reddit-unique solutions and creatives. I'll discuss our progress in each. So first, driving performance of our ad solutions. We continue to invest in delivery formats and measurement and optimization products across the funnel. We saw nearly 50% growth in the number of conversions in Q3 versus Q2, and advertisers are adopting our automation tools, including auto bidding. We continue to drive CAPI adoption and expand our partner ecosystem. We saw over 2x more advertisers adopt CAPI this quarter versus Q2. We also expanded our ads API offering an ecosystem with the launch of our custom audience API, which allows advertisers to target their audience from their customer data platforms on Reddit. Our partnerships with Tealium mParticle and ActionIQ now include both CAPI and custom audience capabilities. Second, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity for our sales force. Over the course of the year, we invested across a few broad categories. Ads manager improvements that consolidate steps and remove manual work from campaign creation automation tools that make it easier to create performance campaigns and reduce the need for manual optimization. For example, multi placement optimization with auto bidding automatically sets bids and placement to maximize performance. We're seeing over 90% adoption of this feature across lower funnel campaigns. And AI-driven workflows for our sales force to extract product insights from customer interactions and streamlined sales support with an AI-powered knowledge base. We also continue investing in brand safety and recently launched pre-bid protection with IS, which will expand our partnership to include brand safety and viewability reporting in the coming months; and third, offering our advertisers ready unique solutions and creatives. In Q3, we launched a refresh design of our Reddit-unique ads product, conversation ads, driving double-digit improvements in conversion rate. We continue to test ad placements within the comments as we expand inventory and improve performance on the surface. In the near term, we anticipate this could reach up to mid-single digit of total impressions. Next, I'll shift to our data licensing business. We continue to address the data licensing opportunity and are in contact with a small set of potential partners. Other revenue was $33.2 million in Q3, driven by data licensing partnerships we signed earlier in the year. In Q3, we entered into a new partnership with Meltwater, a media and social intelligence company. Meltwater accesses Reddit's content through our data API, which allows our customers to uncover brand insights, monitor industry trends and tap into the discussions happening on the platform. Looking ahead, the landscape continues to evolve and we have limited visibility into the timing of additional partnerships. We are focused on ensuring the end customers of our partners continue to see value in their content and meeting uptime and delivery expectations for our existing data partners. Overall, this was another strong quarter for Reddit, and we are pleased with the traction we're seeing in the business. I want to mention a recent key addition to our sales leadership team, Mike Romoff, our new Chief Revenue Officer. Mike is a proven leader and brings a strong track record of sales, partnerships and operational leadership from Google and LinkedIn. Mike will lead all of our sales and sales support functions reporting directly to me. With Mike on board, our strategy remains the same, to help customers grow their businesses on Reddit through our full funnel solution built on our leadership in contextual and interest-based advertising. Looking ahead to Q4, the current industry environment feels stable, and we are benefiting from structural improvements we have made to the core ad business that have sustained differentiated growth over the past quarters. We are monitoring for any potential impact from the upcoming elections, and we remain focused on our strategies and execution. Thank you all for joining for your continued support. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew.\nAndrew Vollero: Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. If three points make a trend, the business trends remained strong for Reddit in the third quarter as we continue to deliver on our key financial goals, namely scale profitably. The main financial headline for Q3 is likely that Reddit reached breakeven on a GAAP basis, which has been an important internal goal. Net income was $30 million, up $40 million sequentially, but with a closer look, this quarter featured a number of encouraging signs of strength and key enablers to achieve GAAP profitability. Let me outline three areas where the company really shined: First, accelerating revenue growth to 68%; second, strong gross margins of 90% and strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%; and third, strong free cash flow of $70 million. Let me expand a bit on each: First, revenues grew 68% year-over-year, a meaningful acceleration from 54% in Q2 and 48% in Q1 driven by a ramp in ad revenue, which grew 56% year-over-year in Q3, up 15 percentage points sequentially. Let me summarize 3 key drivers for revenue acceleration. First, overall, the investments in new ad products and the additional resources for our sales team are working well, and we're seeing solid early traction with our customers. Second, we saw strong gains in ad impressions, which continue to fuel our growth all year long. Pricing growth for Q3 was about flat year-over-year, whereas for the first half of the year, it was slightly down year-over-year. A contributor to pricing was improved ad performance and value delivery for advertisers as cost per click declined, while click-through rates increased. Third, across our channel portfolio, we saw broad strength. More than half our verticals grew over 50% year-over-year with some growing more than 100%. While revenues were accelerating, total adjusted cost growth continues to be modest, up 19% in Q3, less than 1/3 of the rate of revenue growth. Q3 growth in total adjusted costs was sequentially higher than the 11% in Q2, reflecting in part the growth investments fuelling the revenue acceleration in Q3. Total adjusted costs were $254 million, up $13 million sequentially, but down as a percentage of revenue from 86% last quarter to 73% this quarter. Our adjusted cost of revenue remained efficient with gross margins exceeding 90% for Q3, up 280 bps year-over-year. We saw tailwinds from incremental revenue growth, coupled with cloud hosting efficiencies, which more than offset hosting cost increases from user and ad growth and investments in ML to support our consumer platform and ad performance. Adjusted operating expenses were up 17% year-over-year in Q3, slightly higher sequentially, driven primarily by rising people costs and machine translation costs. People costs were higher in Q3, driven by our yearly merit cycle and hire rate. Total headcount was up 4% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, slightly higher than last quarter due to the seasonal build from college graduate hiring from our engineering teams. In the quarter, we launched machine translation in five countries with potentially 30 more on the road map. Our translation efforts today have been cost efficient as the translation costs for each language was less than $1 million per language this quarter and total spend was less than 1% of revenue. We'll continue to test how much content to translate. With strong revenue growth and modest cost growth, it's not surprising. The financials continue to reflect in a very positive way. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $94 million, a 27% adjusted EBITDA margin. That's nearly double our Q2 margin of 14%. Adjusted EBITDA was $101 million higher than prior year, driven in large part by a 72% flow-through on incremental revenues, marking the fourth time the last five quarters over 70%. That's solid cost leverage. Our key focus is to turn profitability into cash flow. Operating cash flow was $72 million, a $79 million positive change from a year ago. For the first three quarters of the year, operating cash flow was $132 million. Our CapEx remains very light, less than $2 million in the quarter and less than 1% of revenue. Free cash flow for Q3 was $70 million and $127 million to date. Free cash flow was 20% of revenue for Q3, which is great to see. Cash on the balance sheet ended at $1.74 billion, up $46 million sequentially. It was particularly encouraging to see we could both grow our cash balances and return capital. In Q3, Reddit execute the net settlement where the tax withholding for employee shares divested in the quarter. Overall Reddit net settled 1.2 million shares at a cost of $66 million. This strategy helped to lower dilution for employee vesting in the quarter. Relatedly, the total number of diluted -- fully diluted shares outstanding in Q3 was $206 million, up 0.7% sequentially to 1.3% for the year, excluding the IPO. We're pacing well against our medium-term goal of 2% to 3% dilution for the year. Stock-based compensation in Q3 was $83 million, about 24% of revenue, in line with peers at this scale. In the quarter, net income was $30 million or $0.18 per basic share and $0.16 per diluted share. This was a positive change from the prior year where both basic and diluted earnings per share were negative $0.13. As we look ahead, we'll share our internal thoughts on revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, where we have the greatest visibility. In the fourth quarter, we estimate revenue in the range of $385 million to $400 million, representing 54% to 60% year-over-year revenue growth with a midpoint of 57%. Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $110 million to $125 million, representing a 30% adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint. Let me close with this thought on areas for financial focus. In the near term, historically, Q4 has been our largest revenue quarter of the year. So we're focused on execution. Medium and longer term, Reddit is scaling profitably. And financially, we are focused on turning differentiated revenue growth, high margins and low CapEx into meaningful cash flow generation. Let me turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteven Huffman: Thank you, Drew. Okay. We're going to start with a few questions from our communities that were asked in the r/rddt subreddit, so the folks who are in that subreddit asking questions. Thank you. There's a ton of great questions in there. I'm going to do two two now. And then Jen, Drew and I will do a bunch of others that we'll report later after our call today. So, first question, \"with White House having an official account now, will Reddit be able to get more official accounts from government officials/agencies for getting information out to people, what will Reddit be doing to help expand that process?\" So big picture, we want businesses, brands, creators, people to be able to have an official presence on Reddit. And so, this is -- you can see the beginnings of this work with our work with Reddit Pro and some of these official accounts. I think prior to this, there's been no place for a business or entity or even a creator to call their home on Reddit. And so, I think that has been historically a gap in our product and we need a place for them to be as a launching pad or that's distinct from the communities themselves as a launching pad for getting into communities. And so, we want Reddit to be a space for everyone, and we need it to be kind of well-labelled and intentional, so we've got a lot of businesses in there already over the course of this year and seeing the White House be on Reddit is really exciting and particularly in the way they use Reddit, which was to reach people in local communities to give them timely information and updates. So, thanks for that question. Next question is basically the Google question. \"One thing that worries me is Google give us -- google takes dynamic, particularly with logged out DAU growth. I guess most of us would be expecting log in to be outgrowing logged out, but logged in is at 27%, logged out is at 70%. Even the two-year stacks, the logged-out DAU crushes. My questions are, what are the dynamics of those users? It would be good if you could have some color on the conversion of them, if they show intention on the Google queries, et cetera? And how much should we worry about Google diverting traffic in the future? Also, if you can comment on the famous say Google is dying and people appending Reddit for queries?\" Okay. Thank you for the question. Look, we've long -- we've long had a, I think, a symbiotic relationship with Google and the Google Search platform specifically. So, I think if you look within the Google traffic, there's a couple of big classes of users that I think are important to recognize. So, the first are people who go to Google with the intention of ending up on Reddit. So, in that stat I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're seeing a lot of those users. Reddit is the sixth most searched word on Google in the U.S. this year. And so those are people literally typing the word Reddit into Google. So, they know they're going to end up on it. They're using, in this case, Google to navigate Reddit. The second class of users is users who are running maybe a more general search on Google and then ending up on Reddit, also valuable. And so, we think of these users as this is an opportunity to teach people that Reddit has the answers to their questions. And so, in that case, it's a great source of new users and a great opportunity to kind of show a new audience what Reddit is all about. It's true the algorithm does kind of come and go, give us and take it away as you say. So, you\u2019ll never hear us celebrate or complain about an algorithm change here. But at the end of the day, Reddit has great content. It answers the questions. It has advice and perspectives that people are looking for, and that\u2019s what Internet consumers want, whether they\u2019re coming directly to Reddit or finding us through other means. Okay. Now I\u2019ll turn it back over to -- yes, in the audience.\nJesse Rose: Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Jen, Drew, I really appreciate it. Rob, why don't we open the line for questions from the analysts that are on the line, please. Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. And your first question comes from the line of Benjamin Black from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Black: Great, thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. So first one really on search, and it would be great to get sort of a status update on your efforts to improve on platform search. What incremental investments you need from here on out, how could search to potentially improve the DAU growth? And how do you think about sort of the pathway and timeline to monetization of search? And secondly, just quickly on machine translation. Can you just double click a little bit on sort of your early learning here so far. Also, are you seeing growth in international content velocity? And could that potentially also support user growth here domestically. Thank you very much.\nSteven Huffman: Okay. First question is search, on platform search specifically, yes. Important part of our strategy and will be a focused investment for us heading into 2025. I think search is a unique opportunity because of both. It kind of strikes out all of the things we care about. It helps new users find their home on Reddit. Even today, many new users in their first session run a search. So, they're literally typing into a text box, what they're interested in, what they're looking for. It helps core users navigate Reddit answer their questions. and it's a monetization opportunity. So, it's one of the few products that kind of touches everything. So, we're working on this as an investment area in 2025. I think the timeline for monetization is, first, we think about the consumer product. So, we're doing some heavy lifting on both the back end and the front end. You'll see movement on that between now and throughout the year. And I think when the product is in a more stable configuration then we can start working on monetization, which I think is, of course, a big opportunity. So, first users, then the monetization, but it's one of our top investments heading into next year. Your second question on machine translation, what are the early learnings? Well, the -- this is a feature that has had a lot of nice stories to it. So first, our primary objective was can we attract -- can we translate English content into other languages. In this case, French has been our focus in the kind of first half of this year was our first language. Can we attract French-speaking users in France on translated content? The answer is, yes. And so, following that simple learning, we're rolling out kind of a full immersive experience into five countries. And then we\u2019re also beginning to translate the larger corpus of Reddit into 30 languages over the course of next year. Machine translation is scaling. We drew four-times many users this quarter as we did last, so we like that trend. And the machine translation has some other positive externalities. One is that the translated content gets indexed into other search engines. And so, we start to see new users from external search who are arriving on the translated pages. And we\u2019re starting to see a little bit of what you\u2019re asking about, does that native language content gets translated into English and show up for US. users. We\u2019re seeing some of that now. I think over time, we\u2019ll see more and more of that. And I think that just speaks to one of the, I think, fine reasons to use Reddit, which is to get a view of the world through the lens of somebody else. And so, machine translation, I think from that point of view, is really helping us fulfil our mission of connecting people around the world. So thanks for the questions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Josey from Citi. Your line is open.\nRonald Josey: Great, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask two, please, and I guess this is for Jen and Drew. So, I guess, Jen and Drew, I'm trying to understand the upside to revenue in the quarter. And I understand that impressions drove growth here, but talk to us more about maybe the mix between ad stack improvements. Jen, you mentioned a few newer products that are driving growth. But then also, I would love to hear your thoughts on newer advertiser demand as SMB and others join the platform. That's question one. And then, Drew, more specifically, you highlighted operating leverage, again, over 70%, clearly achieving positive GAAP OI, which is great to see. Talk to us about just how you view investments versus growth and whether we think we turned the corner on profitability going forward. Thank you, guys.\nJennifer Wong: Yes. I think first part of it, which is sort of the growth drivers. It's a combination of the work we've done on go-to-market and the ad stack. So, first of all, some of the drivers were things like vertical diversification, like over half of our verticals are growing more than 50% year-over-year, like media entertainment, pharma, tech finance, these are areas where we made intentional investments to develop that capability and those client relationships to bring on new lines of business and new customers. So that's really go-to-market driven. Then you have pieces that are really driven by the ad stack. So, things like the lower funnel and the mid-funnel objective growth in the lower funnel almost doubled year-over-year in terms of an objective. That's because we're delivering more conversion volume, right, our revenue grows when advertisers, they find the outcomes, at the volumes that they -- the outcomes they want the volumes and prices that they want in our marketplace, and we're just able to deliver more conversion and traffic outcomes to advertisers. So that's been a significant growth driver in the quarter as you look at the mid and the lower funnel. I mean all objectives grew really nicely, but those two in particular. And then finally, international, as I mentioned, it grew 69% year-over-year. So, in EMEA, in particular, which is an area that we continue to develop, build agency relationships as well as a book of business across both channels, our large customer and mid-market channels. So, each of these, I think, is contributing growth drivers. We are adding new advertisers. Every quarter, there are thousands of new advertisers onto our platform. Now it's not at the levels that we think is possible. I think that TAM is really large compared to where we are today. There are many more lines of business and thousands more advertisers that can be on our platform, but we are adding them and acquiring new customers onto the platform. So those are obviously seeds that are planted for the future while we continue to grow our base book of business. So, I think both were contributors.\nAndrew Vollero: Ron, on the investment side of the world, I mean it's happening now. The great news about our business is it's a really easy one to invest into. And because the ROI is quick, it's immediate, it's measurable. There's a bias here to invest, and we were a young company, which have done a 90 gross margin. The types of investments that we're making right now are measurable, short-term payback, frankly, really easy financial decisions where you're getting multiples back on some of the investments that you're making. Where are we investing? We're investing in ad tech, right? So, there's a number of things that we've added from an ad tech perspective that makes sense. You can measure the products. You have direct visibility into how the customers access your platform. And so, you can see whether or not you're getting returns for that immediately. On the people side, we're adding people in channels and countries easy to take a look at. We're opening up a couple of new markets, easy to take a look at that run a country P&L. So, a simple example would also be the sports deals we talked about last quarter. That was an investment Jen and I made maybe six months ago. Small investment, put a team on the ground and you're able to tangibly produce meaningful licenses with some of the leagues in the world. And so anyway, it's -- right now, it's a pretty straightforward decision. You see that happening right now in the P&L. Like if you look at our cost growth over the last four quarters, if I go back to Q3 of '23, we grew 5%, 7%, 9%, 11% and this quarter, 19% year-over-year. So, you're starting to see that come in Again, we're just in a place where the investments are measurable. They're short term and you can really see the payback. So really, the questions we have are really about, can the organization handle it and can we execute? It really isn't a difficult ROI decision because right now, the returns are very, very strong, as you know, with the high gross margin pull-through.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield from LightShed Partners. Your line is open.\nRichard Greenfield: I am tempted to ask one question with 27 parts, but I'll contain myself. Sorry, I just couldn't resist. As we think of -- this sort of follows up on what Drew was saying, but I think Jen's probably the person I should direct this at. As we think about sort of the ARPU growth, it's obviously a lot far more measured and slower, it's solid overall, but it's obviously a lot slower than what you're seeing in terms of user growth. And I guess the question is, how much is the ARPU growth being pressured by the rapid growth in users and in turn, the number of impressions that you're actually getting on the platform? And maybe the way of thinking about this is why we're asking is like the absolute level of monetization per user still feels very low relative to where I think you should be right now given the level of engagement. And just trying to understand the puts and takes as we think about what will drive dramatically faster ARPU growth? Does user growth actually have to slow for that to happen? Or can you actually get to both happening at the same time if that makes sense.\nJennifer Wong: Thanks for the question, Rich. Just we've always said this, we don't manage to ARPU. It's just -- it's an output, right? It's an output of revenue users and user mix. User mix being things like what geographies the users are in, the mix of logged in and logged out. So, all of those are sort of drivers of ARPU we don't manage to it. Look, our revenue growth, it's -- like I said before, it's driven by advertisers finding the outcomes they want the volumes and prices they want. And we are -- we have really differentiated revenue growth, and we feel really good about that. We also have really differentiated user growth. which we feel really good about. And like we said, we don't focus on ARPU quarter-to-quarter, although we do see headroom in the future over time because we do believe in the value of Reddit users and over time, Reddit users actually increase in engagement as they come in and spend more time with us. So, another way to think about it is the bedrock of our inventory is logged in users. And we do continue to grow the value of our most valuable users who are those logged in users. And there's been very steady growth in those logged-in users. And so, it's just another way to think about it. So again, we don't manage to it, but we do see the headroom in the future over time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone from JMP Securities. Your line is open.\nAndrew Boone: Hi guys.Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to talk about data sales a little bit from here. How do we think about the puts and takes of that category of growth? I understood there's limited visibility, but can you help us understand kind of the guardrails of where this could go. Thanks so much.\nSteven Huffman: Okay. I'll take it. Look, we are -- we're in the market, so there's basically kind of a, call it, like a barbell of customers. So, we've got the big customers on the training side where we're still in conversations with folks, but there's a limited number of deals there. And then there's more customers, that would be smaller deals. We've done a number of deals there that are less training and more real-time access to information on Reddit, social listening, financial services. Those would be the customers we're targeting there. Look, we're still -- I think it's still early days for us here. We've built the kind of enterprise level kind of APIs to support this business. It's -- I'd say for us, it's a nice to have business, and we'll keep those conversations going. But if we're thinking about the future of Reddit, it's really our ads business, it's search, it's more of our kind of on-platform initiatives. But I think the story here, it's Reddit's data is extremely valuable. It's extremely valuable for a lot of players in the market, including to ourselves. And so -- and as I said in my opening remarks, Internet consumers broadly are trying to find Reddit's content for various reasons. And so, look, we\u2019re open and we\u2019re open for business. And I think finding the right batch between making this information accessible and building our own products on top of it is how we think about this.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley Securities. Your line is open.\nNaved Khan: Great, thanks a lot. So, it's great to say conversation pays us up 40%. Can you just maybe talk about the ad road there, where do you think you are in that opportunity in terms of monetizing just that runway?\nJennifer Wong: I think you're asking about monetizing conversation placements. I think look, we're testing ads and comments right now. I think we're still early in both, honestly, the design of that page from a consumer experiences point of view, where I think there's a lot of opportunity in thinking happening because it's such a high-intent page where people are searching for information. And I think we're early in designing the ad format that is appropriate for the different sections of that page. The part of the post, which we launched couple of years ago and the ads in common. So, I think there's a lot of opportunity there. That's about -- that's a minority of our inventory today, but is growing in terms of engagement. So, I do think that, that's an opportunity. But we move both of those things in tandem. And I think there's a lot more actually that we want to do with that page in terms of the experience of when users come in and are guiding and working through the -- getting the information that they want and going deeper and the ad experience will follow that. So, there's headroom there. Again, we don't look at -- we are interested in designing ad formats, but ad load is not a lever that we focus on. We're really focused on designing formats and making sure we're delivering performance against the increasing users that we've seen on to the platform. So, our inventory really grows with that reach.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nEric Sheridan : Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe following up on that last answer and asking one of Jen. Jen, you think about scaling performance measurement, attribution and garnering more direct response, advertising budgets, not in 2024, but over the medium to longer term. What do you see as some of the key investments or unlocks that you're still trying to solve for to continue to progress the budget conversation with the broader advertising community that would have the output of the yield of building additional revenue scale in the years ahead.\nJennifer Wong: Yes. Thanks, Eric. It's a number of things. So end-to-end for performance, we're still continuing on our CAPI drive. It's really important. Measurement is incredibly important to performance. That's proceeding really nicely, but it takes time. We want ideally 100% of our conversion revenue covered by a measurement like CAPI, but we're not there yet. So that's an IT-driven process with our customers, but measurement is incredibly important. The second is automation simplicity. So, I think we have now developed a product that is market competitive in terms of performance outcomes. That's great. We'll continue to chip away at that and improve performance for advertisers quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and that's what the market demands and allow them to scale, especially with the increased reach of our users. That's great. But it has to be simple in order for smaller advertisers to take advantage of that, which means automation, really end-to-end simplicity and we're not there yet. That's something that we're building more end-to-end automation in the world of performance. But that will unlock more advertisers. The third is in the lower funnel is shopping. Shopping is just a -- it's a different sub-objective within the lower funnel performance. It requires catalog ingest, its own machine learning models, more complicated measurement and we're building that capability, but it's a longer journey to sort of birth that objective, something we believe in for Reddit, but that's also something that I think would bolster our lower funnel. So those three things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rohit Kulkarni from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.\nRohit Kulkarni: Hey, thank you. Question about just how are you using Gen AI in your ad tech. Maybe talk about what impact have you already seen with advertising adoption among the lines of, Jen, you mentioned reducing friction in the automation? And perhaps what category of new customers are coming as a result of any new tools that you're providing such advertisers around gen AI?\nJennifer Wong: Yes. Thanks for asking. So, we started -- we launched a couple of quarters ago a headline generator using gen AI where you can just put in the URL from your website, and it actually gives you Reddity headlines that actually drive improved ad performance and having Reddity type headlines in your ads really does make a difference in the ad resonance. So that's just an example of, I think, what's possible in terms of ad creative. We did acquire a company called Memorable AI. Their specialty is in understanding the components of creative and how they drive performance might be the -- is it a hero image, the color of the image, the type of text, et cetera. So, they drive the insights in how to optimize creative. We have an ability -- we want to take that and integrate into our ad stack, and the next step would be having those insights tied to a gen AI capability to actually do the work based on those insights. So, it's early in that we just acquired them, and we're integrating them into our asset, but we do see a very fulsome and exciting road map related to ad creative in terms of gen AI. The other automation that you'll see that is coming in the platform is going to really be around with a little bit of AI on top in terms of the end-to-end performance, that's taking steps out of the tool to make things easier to execute in terms of campaign setup and campaign optimization.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Colantuoni from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nJohn Colantuoni : Great, thanks for taking my question. You talked last quarter about conversation adds creating some pricing headwinds. Can you talk about if conversation adds are still putting pressure on CPMs and also talk to the impact on pricing early adoption and sort of the reception of some of your newer premium conversation adds?\nJennifer Wong: Sure. Yes, I would say that the conversation placement compared to the feed still has less demand in that placement because it's newer. And we are testing ads in comments. So, we'll be adding some ad load into that page and obviously, adoption for a new ad unit like that does take time. But there are ways that we've been growing that demand. So, for example, I mentioned earlier the multi-placement optimization, where customers can get the benefit of us optimizing across both pieces of inventory, especially when they're looking for a specific outcome that's helped increase demand fluidly across these two surfaces because what the advertiser really wants is the outcome, and they're sort of more indifferent to the placement. And so that's helping advertisers get acquainted with the performance in that unit where we can fluidly optimize for them and take some friction out and having to set up different ad groups, et cetera, and think about those two ad units and we sort of adjust the creative and the optimization across both. So, I do think that there is increased demand. We're seeing good increased demand against that unit. But of course, we're also seeing a lot of supply, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of the engagement on that page. So, they\u2019re moving in tandem. The good news is there\u2019s incredible opportunity on that page. That page is extremely contextual, extremely high intent. It is a high converting page with great outcomes. And we\u2019re still early in the ad formats and designing the ads for that page. So, it\u2019s just incredible opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is to go back to Eric's earlier question about sort of '25 drivers. Jen, could you just sort of walk us through, we think through all the ad innovation that you're most excited about, which of the products have you sort of built the back-end tech stack for that are going to sort of roll out into '25 that you think could really be the next driver of performance and add budget growth for you guys? And then the second one, Steve, can you just kind of walk us through your conceptual timeline about search, building search and then starting to test monetization of search.\nJennifer Wong: Yes. Happy to talk about the ad stack. So, for '25, I would say we're continuing on the same journey in terms of our strategy, right? We want to be a full funnel solution for advertisers. We want to deliver market competitive outcomes across brand and performance advertising. And I think we're doing that in the objectives that we have across brands, some impressions, brand lift middle of the funnel for traffic and lower funnel in terms of key conversions, things like at the card purchase and then app install. So, there's more there. We're just at the beginning of that journey. There's more that we can do in terms of our modelling. There's more that we can do on measurement, like we can add modelling to measurement. There's a lot more that we can do to give more value and more scale to advertisers in those objectives. And remember, that can all scale with user growth. So, it's a really nice position to be in. and we will deliver more efficient. It's still efficiencies driven market. So, we will still deliver more efficiency and return on ad spend to them next year, which will help them scale their work with us. In addition to that, we see an opportunity to enhance the brand part of our proposition. On the brand side, we've always been very successful because of the high engagement and the big unduplicated reach on a monthly basis. And brand has an opportunity to be a lot more automated and have a lot more selection in terms of the optimizations for advertisers like optimizing to reach our lowest cost, the things that we've given to advertisers on the performance side that drive some automation from them, not end-to-end automation, but automation on the optimization to make it easy. We can do that in brand as well. And so that will be something that we're investing in. The second is on the lower funnel, while we have a really nice foundation in conversions in app install, we want to build out shopping, as I mentioned before. That's just another capability in the lower funnel that I think can get advertisers another way to talk to customers. So that would be the second piece. And the third, which I think we're now at the moment that we can do, which is the end-to-end automation. And you've seen this with Advantages and Performance Max from Google. It really does make optimization campaign set up much simpler and scalable for advertisers. In order to do that, there's two steps. Like you have to have every part of the ad stack in place before you automate over it. And the second is you need to build a certain amount of trust with your customers before you automate all of those activities so that they really understand what's happening at each step. I think we are there at that point. And so, we've been investing and starting to put together these items into a more automated experience. So those are the three things that we've been starting to invest in, in the background and think about as we go into '25 on top of the continuing road map from this year in terms of delivering the market competitive performance.\nSteven Huffman: Okay. And so then on the search side, look, we'll be doing a lot of heavy lifting throughout 2025, so high-level road map, modernizing our search products, so kind of bringing it up to table stakes or what are table stakes in this era. So really good auto complete, beautiful results pages. We'll start working integrating LLM into making our results more sophisticated I mean helping users navigate all of the results that come back from Reddit. And there's a lot of back-end work as well, which is improving our own ability to do retrieval getting more sophisticated ranking ourselves and then creating more entry points in the search as well. So not just the search button on Reddit, but for example, users who arrive to Reddit from external search helping them kind of expand their queries and climb more of what they're looking for. So, all of that will be under heavy construction. We do a lot of testing, so you'll start to see this over the course of the next year. In terms of when we start monetization, we need to have some stability in the product, right? It's hard to monetize the product and the pickles are moving all over. So that's the simplest answer. I think most likely is we'll find some products we like next year. That's something we'll begin planning. And so, I wouldn't expect actual dollars to be coming in, in 2025, but hopefully not too far after. So, we'll follow the product. There's lots of exciting stuff coming. I think the opportunity is really big. And we're looking forward to getting there. But it is a multistep process. But I think you'll be able to follow along with us each quarter as we go next year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nThomas Champion : Jen maybe for you. Your comments on the market sound quite a bit better than maybe the last call. Curious if you agree, what were maybe the signposts that emerged during the quarter? And just any early take on the market in '25.\nJennifer Wong: Thanks for the question. Yes, I'd say, look, probably when we last spoke, I had some caution about Q4 around the election. And what I would say is, I think the -- it doesn't seem to be affecting bookings. I think there is caution around delivery timing. So, there might be advertisers who are going to be a little quiet for certain periods of time, but it doesn't seem to affect their interest in growing their business with us in Q4 and continuing their advertising. So, I think that's where at least what we've seen so far. '25, it's early, but I would say the signals are that it's stable that there's probably some optimism. I think most folks at the Holocaust will say that they're going to be up in general, unless there's been major client or share shift, which I think is good. And I think brand advertising has been really healthy. And we've seen strength across all our objectives. I think it's still an efficiency-driven market. So I do think at the mid- and lower funnel, there are still pressure to improve ROAS year-on-year. But I do think that there is healthy interest and investment in brand. which I think is always a good sign. So I think the full funnel is actually all in a healthy place in terms of investment. That's our view so far.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nDouglas Anmuth : Great. Maybe two for Steve. With Google and OpenAI already under contract, could you characterize the demand for future large language model partnerships currently? And do you feel like you're making progress in working through some of those data and privacy requirements that you've talked about. So that's one. And then maybe second, this is a frequent question that we get from investors. But hoping you could just help us think through some of the puts and takes of getting up to 3% of daily traffic coming from Google.\nSteven Huffman: Sure. Okay. So, first question is on data partnerships. So, you mentioned a couple of big ones, Google and OpenAI. Like as I mentioned, we are talking to folks. It's important that in, I think, any commercial agreement -- non-commercial agreement for that matter as well that the partners are respectful of our users. So that's inclusive of our public data policy. And then also, it needs to be fair to our business. And so, I think those deals have so far been complex. I wouldn't say to me not even close to Reddit, but none of them are existential for Reddit. I'd say they're all kind of nice-to-have. Our general principle is we're open and open for business, but it needs to be on terms that work for us, our business and our users. So, we're kind of working through each of those. But as you've also seen, we're not afraid to block people or cut people off if we don't think we're going to come to terms there. And so, I think there'll be a range of outcomes. And then on the kind of more traditional external search side. Yes, look, I think, as I mentioned, had a I think symbiotic relationship with the Google Search platform. It's high utility for some of our core users. Those users are going to come to Reddit regardless. And it's a great source of new users effectively a marketing channel to educate new users about Reddit. And look, we've seen algorithm change a lot over the years, and of course, it always will. And the Google, of course, experiments with all sorts of new search products, some help, some hurt, but we've been on this journey for 19 years. So yes, there's volatility in that traffic. But if you look over the last few years, our log in growth has been very stable and reliable. Our app growth has been stable and reliable. And that's where the majority -- the vast majority of our revenue is there. So yes, volatility on the logged-out users, on the external users, but our actual business has been very stable and reliable growth over that time period, and that's what we see looking forward as well.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alan Gould from Loop Capital. Your line is open.\nAlan Gould : Thanks for taking the question. So, Jen, I know you said you don't manage towards ARPU, but domestic ad ARPU had a significant uptick this quarter from minus 12% year-over-year in 2Q to plus 2% year-over-year in 3Q. I know Drew said pricing has improved. How much of that is pricing? And how much -- what other areas are contributing to that?\nJennifer Wong: So I mean, ARPU is going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. That's just the reality of being focused on revenue growth and user growth. And so I don't necessarily read too much into quarter-over-quarter movements in ARPU, but yes, I mean, the drivers of ARPU in general are in terms of -- it's definitely things like pricing, and ad formats or ad load or obviously contributors to ARPU growth. The way I think about it is our business has really grown significantly in the mid- and lower front. And you do that by growing volume of clicks and conversions, which increases the value per impression that an advertiser gets, right? And it's increasing their return and the efficiency that we're delivering to them and that just increases the value of every impression because of the click volume and the conversions that they're seeing from advertising on Reddit. So, I do think that delivering performance is definitely helpful for advertisers and for us in delivering return on ad spend for advertisers which drives demand, which drives spending and which can drive pricing and competition and interest in those objectives and scaling those objectives. So I do think it's driven by a lot of the work we've done in the ad stack to deliver performance.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Salmon from New Street Research. Your line is open.\nDaniel Salmon - New Street Research: Hey guys. This is Bill speaking for Dan Salmon from New Street. Thanks for taking our question. I was just wondering, could you guys give us an update on your go-to-market strategy for data licensing, how it's evolving, both for like large language model trainers and its size customers. It'd be great to hear about your latest earnings.\nJennifer Wong: Sure. So as Steve mentioned before, our go-to-market is kind of a barbell. We have discussions with a small group of folks who are developing training AI models. The other side is maybe marketing intelligence firms or verticals who are interested in slices of Reddit data, and those tend to be smaller deals, but more volume. And the training folks, there's usually a combination of both freshness that they're interested in as well as the total corpus of information to train on. Look, I think that we continue to -- we're -- we continue to talk to like what I'd say is a small group of folks who are in the world of AI training. It's a really evolving landscape. Many of those companies are trying to figure out their own strategies, what their product is going to be, what they're building, how they're investing, how Reddit fits into it. So, I think we are -- it's well known that a there to help and be a thought partner in this, et cetera. But I think it is an evolving landscape where they're sifting out their strategies, and we're a part of that strategy. So that's just where we are in the landscape. The other side of the go-to-market, it's a very small team, but is out there talking to marketing intelligence companies and also looking at some verticals. There, what we're doing is we're both engaging who would be the client, the customer to us as well as their end customers, right? So, if your marketing intelligence term, you might have customers who are brands and companies. If you're a financial services firm, you might have an end customer who's financial services firm. And there, what we're doing is really helping them show the value to their end customers and make sure that their end customers have a great experience in understanding what the Reddit data -- how the Reddit data can bring value. And that's how we sort of grow that business. We get more people excited about what you can learn and the insights you can get from Reddit data and to continue to see value in it and so that's what that work looks like.\nOperator: There are no further questions. Please go ahead.\nJesse Rose: Yes. Thanks, Rob. Yes, I think we'll wrap here. I appreciate everyone joining the call today. If anyone has any follow-up questions, please do not hesitate to reach out. We, of course, look forward to keeping the dialogue open. Thanks, everyone.\nSteven Huffman: Thanks all.\nOperator: This concludes Reddit's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steven Huffman",
            "content": "Thanks Jesse. Hey everyone, thank you for joining and welcome to our third quarter earnings call. I'm excited to share that Q3 was a landmark quarter for Reddit. We averaged over 97 million DA UQ, an increase of 47% from last year. And for the first time, we exceeded 100 million DA UQ a few times during the quarter, which has been a longstanding milestone for us. Our Q3 revenue grew 68% year-over-year, and I'm proud to announce that we also achieved GAAP profitability. Reddit's influence continues to grow across the broader Internet. In 2024, so far, the word Reddit was the sixth most Googled word in the United States, underscoring that when people are looking for answers, advice or community, they seek out Reddit specifically. We saw this play out in real time when the White House came to Reddit to share critical information during the recent hurricanes, they used our Reddit Pro tools to identify the right communities to reach people affected by these events. In fact, thousands of businesses are now using Reddit Pro, including the MLB and NFL. We're using it to share exclusive content with communities. We continue to see more businesses and organizations come to Reddit to find their audience. We remain focused on making Reddit the best place on the Internet for conversations and community, which means, quite simply, we're continuously improving the user experience by making discovery easier, making the platform faster and smarter, enabling seamless contribution and simplifying moderation. A few highlights from the quarter include our conversation pages, conversation page views exceeded 90 billion, growing 40% year-over-year in Q3 as users are getting into the conversations faster and more often. We refreshed the Ask Me Anything or AMA product, which led to a fivefold increase in the number of AMAs created in the new format. And we launched better tools for posting that have both increased posts and reduced moderator removals, which makes a better experience for everybody. And as for growing beyond the United States, our efforts here are proving successful. International DAU grew 44% year-over-year, led by 53% growth in our focus markets, most notably in France, India and the Philippines. This year we started using AI to translate Reddit's corpus into other languages, making it more accessible for non-English speakers to enjoy in their native languages. After promising results with French in the first half of this year, we expanded our coverage to include Spanish, Portuguese, Italian and German. This quarter, machine translation drove four times more users than last quarter, and based on the success we've seen so far, we plan to expand machine translation to over 30 countries through 2025. As Reddit becomes a truly global platform, we are focused on ensuring everyone, regardless of their language, can participate in and benefit from the communities on Reddit. Looking ahead, improving the search experience on Reddit is a key part of our strategy. We want to ensure that all users have the best experience possible. This includes users coming to Reddit from external search and those searching directly on Reddit who are looking for recommendations on what to buy, what to watch, or what products or services are the best. We know many users are looking for more than just answers. They are looking for authentic real-world insights and advice from the communities on Reddit. So, we're focused on making the experience of finding relevant conversations and content on Reddit easier and more intuitive. Continuing to look to 2025 and beyond, we'll seek opportunities to accelerate our roadmap, whether through new product developments, global expansion, or growing our ads business, all while maintaining our commitment to scaling profitably and ensuring that Reddit continues to be the go-to place for conversations and community on the Internet. Thank you again for being a part of this exciting journey with us. I'll now hand it over to Jen. Thank you, Drew. Okay. We're going to start with a few questions from our communities that were asked in the r/rddt subreddit, so the folks who are in that subreddit asking questions. Thank you. There's a ton of great questions in there. I'm going to do two two now. And then Jen, Drew and I will do a bunch of others that we'll report later after our call today. So, first question, \"with White House having an official account now, will Reddit be able to get more official accounts from government officials/agencies for getting information out to people, what will Reddit be doing to help expand that process?\" So big picture, we want businesses, brands, creators, people to be able to have an official presence on Reddit. And so, this is -- you can see the beginnings of this work with our work with Reddit Pro and some of these official accounts. I think prior to this, there's been no place for a business or entity or even a creator to call their home on Reddit. And so, I think that has been historically a gap in our product and we need a place for them to be as a launching pad or that's distinct from the communities themselves as a launching pad for getting into communities. And so, we want Reddit to be a space for everyone, and we need it to be kind of well-labelled and intentional, so we've got a lot of businesses in there already over the course of this year and seeing the White House be on Reddit is really exciting and particularly in the way they use Reddit, which was to reach people in local communities to give them timely information and updates. So, thanks for that question. Next question is basically the Google question. \"One thing that worries me is Google give us -- google takes dynamic, particularly with logged out DAU growth. I guess most of us would be expecting log in to be outgrowing logged out, but logged in is at 27%, logged out is at 70%. Even the two-year stacks, the logged-out DAU crushes. My questions are, what are the dynamics of those users? It would be good if you could have some color on the conversion of them, if they show intention on the Google queries, et cetera? And how much should we worry about Google diverting traffic in the future? Also, if you can comment on the famous say Google is dying and people appending Reddit for queries?\" Okay. Thank you for the question. Look, we've long -- we've long had a, I think, a symbiotic relationship with Google and the Google Search platform specifically. So, I think if you look within the Google traffic, there's a couple of big classes of users that I think are important to recognize. So, the first are people who go to Google with the intention of ending up on Reddit. So, in that stat I mentioned in my opening remarks, we're seeing a lot of those users. Reddit is the sixth most searched word on Google in the U.S. this year. And so those are people literally typing the word Reddit into Google. So, they know they're going to end up on it. They're using, in this case, Google to navigate Reddit. The second class of users is users who are running maybe a more general search on Google and then ending up on Reddit, also valuable. And so, we think of these users as this is an opportunity to teach people that Reddit has the answers to their questions. And so, in that case, it's a great source of new users and a great opportunity to kind of show a new audience what Reddit is all about. It's true the algorithm does kind of come and go, give us and take it away as you say. So, you'll never hear us celebrate or complain about an algorithm change here. But at the end of the day, Reddit has great content. It answers the questions. It has advice and perspectives that people are looking for, and that's what Internet consumers want, whether they're coming directly to Reddit or finding us through other means. Okay. Now I'll turn it back over to -- yes, in the audience. Okay. First question is search, on platform search specifically, yes. Important part of our strategy and will be a focused investment for us heading into 2025. I think search is a unique opportunity because of both. It kind of strikes out all of the things we care about. It helps new users find their home on Reddit. Even today, many new users in their first session run a search. So, they're literally typing into a text box, what they're interested in, what they're looking for. It helps core users navigate Reddit answer their questions. and it's a monetization opportunity. So, it's one of the few products that kind of touches everything. So, we're working on this as an investment area in 2025. I think the timeline for monetization is, first, we think about the consumer product. So, we're doing some heavy lifting on both the back end and the front end. You'll see movement on that between now and throughout the year. And I think when the product is in a more stable configuration then we can start working on monetization, which I think is, of course, a big opportunity. So, first users, then the monetization, but it's one of our top investments heading into next year. Your second question on machine translation, what are the early learnings? Well, the -- this is a feature that has had a lot of nice stories to it. So first, our primary objective was can we attract -- can we translate English content into other languages. In this case, French has been our focus in the kind of first half of this year was our first language. Can we attract French-speaking users in France on translated content? The answer is, yes. And so, following that simple learning, we're rolling out kind of a full immersive experience into five countries. And then we're also beginning to translate the larger corpus of Reddit into 30 languages over the course of next year. Machine translation is scaling. We drew four-times many users this quarter as we did last, so we like that trend. And the machine translation has some other positive externalities. One is that the translated content gets indexed into other search engines. And so, we start to see new users from external search who are arriving on the translated pages. And we're starting to see a little bit of what you're asking about, does that native language content gets translated into English and show up for US. users. We're seeing some of that now. I think over time, we'll see more and more of that. And I think that just speaks to one of the, I think, fine reasons to use Reddit, which is to get a view of the world through the lens of somebody else. And so, machine translation, I think from that point of view, is really helping us fulfil our mission of connecting people around the world. So thanks for the questions. Okay. I'll take it. Look, we are -- we're in the market, so there's basically kind of a, call it, like a barbell of customers. So, we've got the big customers on the training side where we're still in conversations with folks, but there's a limited number of deals there. And then there's more customers, that would be smaller deals. We've done a number of deals there that are less training and more real-time access to information on Reddit, social listening, financial services. Those would be the customers we're targeting there. Look, we're still -- I think it's still early days for us here. We've built the kind of enterprise level kind of APIs to support this business. It's -- I'd say for us, it's a nice to have business, and we'll keep those conversations going. But if we're thinking about the future of Reddit, it's really our ads business, it's search, it's more of our kind of on-platform initiatives. But I think the story here, it's Reddit's data is extremely valuable. It's extremely valuable for a lot of players in the market, including to ourselves. And so -- and as I said in my opening remarks, Internet consumers broadly are trying to find Reddit's content for various reasons. And so, look, we're open and we're open for business. And I think finding the right batch between making this information accessible and building our own products on top of it is how we think about this. Okay. And so then on the search side, look, we'll be doing a lot of heavy lifting throughout 2025, so high-level road map, modernizing our search products, so kind of bringing it up to table stakes or what are table stakes in this era. So really good auto complete, beautiful results pages. We'll start working integrating LLM into making our results more sophisticated I mean helping users navigate all of the results that come back from Reddit. And there's a lot of back-end work as well, which is improving our own ability to do retrieval getting more sophisticated ranking ourselves and then creating more entry points in the search as well. So not just the search button on Reddit, but for example, users who arrive to Reddit from external search helping them kind of expand their queries and climb more of what they're looking for. So, all of that will be under heavy construction. We do a lot of testing, so you'll start to see this over the course of the next year. In terms of when we start monetization, we need to have some stability in the product, right? It's hard to monetize the product and the pickles are moving all over. So that's the simplest answer. I think most likely is we'll find some products we like next year. That's something we'll begin planning. And so, I wouldn't expect actual dollars to be coming in, in 2025, but hopefully not too far after. So, we'll follow the product. There's lots of exciting stuff coming. I think the opportunity is really big. And we're looking forward to getting there. But it is a multistep process. But I think you'll be able to follow along with us each quarter as we go next year. Sure. Okay. So, first question is on data partnerships. So, you mentioned a couple of big ones, Google and OpenAI. Like as I mentioned, we are talking to folks. It's important that in, I think, any commercial agreement -- non-commercial agreement for that matter as well that the partners are respectful of our users. So that's inclusive of our public data policy. And then also, it needs to be fair to our business. And so, I think those deals have so far been complex. I wouldn't say to me not even close to Reddit, but none of them are existential for Reddit. I'd say they're all kind of nice-to-have. Our general principle is we're open and open for business, but it needs to be on terms that work for us, our business and our users. So, we're kind of working through each of those. But as you've also seen, we're not afraid to block people or cut people off if we don't think we're going to come to terms there. And so, I think there'll be a range of outcomes. And then on the kind of more traditional external search side. Yes, look, I think, as I mentioned, had a I think symbiotic relationship with the Google Search platform. It's high utility for some of our core users. Those users are going to come to Reddit regardless. And it's a great source of new users effectively a marketing channel to educate new users about Reddit. And look, we've seen algorithm change a lot over the years, and of course, it always will. And the Google, of course, experiments with all sorts of new search products, some help, some hurt, but we've been on this journey for 19 years. So yes, there's volatility in that traffic. But if you look over the last few years, our log in growth has been very stable and reliable. Our app growth has been stable and reliable. And that's where the majority -- the vast majority of our revenue is there. So yes, volatility on the logged-out users, on the external users, but our actual business has been very stable and reliable growth over that time period, and that's what we see looking forward as well. Thanks all."

            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. If three points make a trend, the business trends remained strong for Reddit in the third quarter as we continue to deliver on our key financial goals, namely scale profitably. The main financial headline for Q3 is likely that Reddit reached breakeven on a GAAP basis, which has been an important internal goal. Net income was $30 million, up $40 million sequentially, but with a closer look, this quarter featured a number of encouraging signs of strength and key enablers to achieve GAAP profitability. Let me outline three areas where the company really shined: First, accelerating revenue growth to 68%; second, strong gross margins of 90% and strong adjusted EBITDA margins of 27%; and third, strong free cash flow of $70 million. Let me expand a bit on each: First, revenues grew 68% year-over-year, a meaningful acceleration from 54% in Q2 and 48% in Q1 driven by a ramp in ad revenue, which grew 56% year-over-year in Q3, up 15 percentage points sequentially. Let me summarize 3 key drivers for revenue acceleration. First, overall, the investments in new ad products and the additional resources for our sales team are working well, and we're seeing solid early traction with our customers. Second, we saw strong gains in ad impressions, which continue to fuel our growth all year long. Pricing growth for Q3 was about flat year-over-year, whereas for the first half of the year, it was slightly down year-over-year. A contributor to pricing was improved ad performance and value delivery for advertisers as cost per click declined, while click-through rates increased. Third, across our channel portfolio, we saw broad strength. More than half our verticals grew over 50% year-over-year with some growing more than 100%. While revenues were accelerating, total adjusted cost growth continues to be modest, up 19% in Q3, less than 1/3 of the rate of revenue growth. Q3 growth in total adjusted costs was sequentially higher than the 11% in Q2, reflecting in part the growth investments fuelling the revenue acceleration in Q3. Total adjusted costs were $254 million, up $13 million sequentially, but down as a percentage of revenue from 86% last quarter to 73% this quarter. Our adjusted cost of revenue remained efficient with gross margins exceeding 90% for Q3, up 280 bps year-over-year. We saw tailwinds from incremental revenue growth, coupled with cloud hosting efficiencies, which more than offset hosting cost increases from user and ad growth and investments in ML to support our consumer platform and ad performance. Adjusted operating expenses were up 17% year-over-year in Q3, slightly higher sequentially, driven primarily by rising people costs and machine translation costs. People costs were higher in Q3, driven by our yearly merit cycle and hire rate. Total headcount was up 4% sequentially and 7% year-over-year, slightly higher than last quarter due to the seasonal build from college graduate hiring from our engineering teams. In the quarter, we launched machine translation in five countries with potentially 30 more on the road map. Our translation efforts today have been cost efficient as the translation costs for each language was less than $1 million per language this quarter and total spend was less than 1% of revenue. We'll continue to test how much content to translate. With strong revenue growth and modest cost growth, it's not surprising. The financials continue to reflect in a very positive way. Q3 adjusted EBITDA was $94 million, a 27% adjusted EBITDA margin. That's nearly double our Q2 margin of 14%. Adjusted EBITDA was $101 million higher than prior year, driven in large part by a 72% flow-through on incremental revenues, marking the fourth time the last five quarters over 70%. That's solid cost leverage. Our key focus is to turn profitability into cash flow. Operating cash flow was $72 million, a $79 million positive change from a year ago. For the first three quarters of the year, operating cash flow was $132 million. Our CapEx remains very light, less than $2 million in the quarter and less than 1% of revenue. Free cash flow for Q3 was $70 million and $127 million to date. Free cash flow was 20% of revenue for Q3, which is great to see. Cash on the balance sheet ended at $1.74 billion, up $46 million sequentially. It was particularly encouraging to see we could both grow our cash balances and return capital. In Q3, Reddit execute the net settlement where the tax withholding for employee shares divested in the quarter. Overall Reddit net settled 1.2 million shares at a cost of $66 million. This strategy helped to lower dilution for employee vesting in the quarter. Relatedly, the total number of diluted -- fully diluted shares outstanding in Q3 was $206 million, up 0.7% sequentially to 1.3% for the year, excluding the IPO. We're pacing well against our medium-term goal of 2% to 3% dilution for the year. Stock-based compensation in Q3 was $83 million, about 24% of revenue, in line with peers at this scale. In the quarter, net income was $30 million or $0.18 per basic share and $0.16 per diluted share. This was a positive change from the prior year where both basic and diluted earnings per share were negative $0.13. As we look ahead, we'll share our internal thoughts on revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter, where we have the greatest visibility. In the fourth quarter, we estimate revenue in the range of $385 million to $400 million, representing 54% to 60% year-over-year revenue growth with a midpoint of 57%. Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $110 million to $125 million, representing a 30% adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint. Let me close with this thought on areas for financial focus. In the near term, historically, Q4 has been our largest revenue quarter of the year. So we're focused on execution. Medium and longer term, Reddit is scaling profitably. And financially, we are focused on turning differentiated revenue growth, high margins and low CapEx into meaningful cash flow generation. Let me turn the call back over to Steve. Ron, on the investment side of the world, I mean it's happening now. The great news about our business is it's a really easy one to invest into. And because the ROI is quick, it's immediate, it's measurable. There's a bias here to invest, and we were a young company, which have done a 90 gross margin. The types of investments that we're making right now are measurable, short-term payback, frankly, really easy financial decisions where you're getting multiples back on some of the investments that you're making. Where are we investing? We're investing in ad tech, right? So, there's a number of things that we've added from an ad tech perspective that makes sense. You can measure the products. You have direct visibility into how the customers access your platform. And so, you can see whether or not you're getting returns for that immediately. On the people side, we're adding people in channels and countries easy to take a look at. We're opening up a couple of new markets, easy to take a look at that run a country P&L. So, a simple example would also be the sports deals we talked about last quarter. That was an investment Jen and I made maybe six months ago. Small investment, put a team on the ground and you're able to tangibly produce meaningful licenses with some of the leagues in the world. And so anyway, it's -- right now, it's a pretty straightforward decision. You see that happening right now in the P&L. Like if you look at our cost growth over the last four quarters, if I go back to Q3 of '23, we grew 5%, 7%, 9%, 11% and this quarter, 19% year-over-year. So, you're starting to see that come in Again, we're just in a place where the investments are measurable. They're short term and you can really see the payback. So really, the questions we have are really about, can the organization handle it and can we execute? It really isn't a difficult ROI decision because right now, the returns are very, very strong, as you know, with the high gross margin pull-through."

            "name": "Jennifer Wong",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. It was a strong quarter for Reddit as our unique proposition and core platform improvements are driving differentiated growth. Total revenue in Q3 grew 68% year-over-year to $348.4 million. The advertising business grew 56% year-over-year to $315.1 million driven by strong growth across objectives, channels, verticals and geographies. Let me discuss our ad revenue drivers in more detail. We saw strong year-over-year growth in impressions from higher user growth, more efficient ad load and expansion of conversation placement ads, while pricing was mostly consistent with the prior year. Revenue across the funnel accelerated year-over-year. We continue to deliver more value to our customers by improving ad performance, particularly in the middle and lower funnel, which is 2/3 of our road map. Performance revenue from mid- and lower funnel objectives drove more than half the growth in the quarter and accounted for about 60% of total advertising revenue. We more than doubled the number of clicks this quarter as we continue to enhance our lower funnel capabilities. We saw continued momentum across channels. The scaled business, including mid-market and SMB customers, grew over 80% year-over-year and continues to be an area of investment. This was largely driven by managed clients where we provide service. We saw strength across verticals led by auto, consumer goods, financial services and pharmaceuticals, all adding new clients and lines of business in Q3 and total international revenue grew 57% year-over-year as we saw strength in the EMEA markets across both large and midsized customers. In our ad stack, we continue to focus on: number one, driving performance of our ad solutions across the funnel; two, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity for our sales force; and three, offering our advertisers Reddit-unique solutions and creatives. I'll discuss our progress in each. So first, driving performance of our ad solutions. We continue to invest in delivery formats and measurement and optimization products across the funnel. We saw nearly 50% growth in the number of conversions in Q3 versus Q2, and advertisers are adopting our automation tools, including auto bidding. We continue to drive CAPI adoption and expand our partner ecosystem. We saw over 2x more advertisers adopt CAPI this quarter versus Q2. We also expanded our ads API offering an ecosystem with the launch of our custom audience API, which allows advertisers to target their audience from their customer data platforms on Reddit. Our partnerships with Tealium mParticle and ActionIQ now include both CAPI and custom audience capabilities. Second, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity for our sales force. Over the course of the year, we invested across a few broad categories. Ads manager improvements that consolidate steps and remove manual work from campaign creation automation tools that make it easier to create performance campaigns and reduce the need for manual optimization. For example, multi placement optimization with auto bidding automatically sets bids and placement to maximize performance. We're seeing over 90% adoption of this feature across lower funnel campaigns. And AI-driven workflows for our sales force to extract product insights from customer interactions and streamlined sales support with an AI-powered knowledge base. We also continue investing in brand safety and recently launched pre-bid protection with IS, which will expand our partnership to include brand safety and viewability reporting in the coming months; and third, offering our advertisers ready unique solutions and creatives. In Q3, we launched a refresh design of our Reddit-unique ads product, conversation ads, driving double-digit improvements in conversion rate. We continue to test ad placements within the comments as we expand inventory and improve performance on the surface. In the near term, we anticipate this could reach up to mid-single digit of total impressions. Next, I'll shift to our data licensing business. We continue to address the data licensing opportunity and are in contact with a small set of potential partners. Other revenue was $33.2 million in Q3, driven by data licensing partnerships we signed earlier in the year. In Q3, we entered into a new partnership with Meltwater, a media and social intelligence company. Meltwater accesses Reddit's content through our data API, which allows our customers to uncover brand insights, monitor industry trends and tap into the discussions happening on the platform. Looking ahead, the landscape continues to evolve and we have limited visibility into the timing of additional partnerships. We are focused on ensuring the end customers of our partners continue to see value in their content and meeting uptime and delivery expectations for our existing data partners. Overall, this was another strong quarter for Reddit, and we are pleased with the traction we're seeing in the business. I want to mention a recent key addition to our sales leadership team, Mike Romoff, our new Chief Revenue Officer. Mike is a proven leader and brings a strong track record of sales, partnerships and operational leadership from Google and LinkedIn. Mike will lead all of our sales and sales support functions reporting directly to me. With Mike on board, our strategy remains the same, to help customers grow their businesses on Reddit through our full funnel solution built on our leadership in contextual and interest-based advertising. Looking ahead to Q4, the current industry environment feels stable, and we are benefiting from structural improvements we have made to the core ad business that have sustained differentiated growth over the past quarters. We are monitoring for any potential impact from the upcoming elections, and we remain focused on our strategies and execution. Thank you all for joining for your continued support. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew. Yes. I think first part of it, which is sort of the growth drivers. It's a combination of the work we've done on go-to-market and the ad stack. So, first of all, some of the drivers were things like vertical diversification, like over half of our verticals are growing more than 50% year-over-year, like media entertainment, pharma, tech finance, these are areas where we made intentional investments to develop that capability and those client relationships to bring on new lines of business and new customers. So that's really go-to-market driven. Then you have pieces that are really driven by the ad stack. So, things like the lower funnel and the mid-funnel objective growth in the lower funnel almost doubled year-over-year in terms of an objective. That's because we're delivering more conversion volume, right, our revenue grows when advertisers, they find the outcomes, at the volumes that they -- the outcomes they want the volumes and prices that they want in our marketplace, and we're just able to deliver more conversion and traffic outcomes to advertisers. So that's been a significant growth driver in the quarter as you look at the mid and the lower funnel. I mean all objectives grew really nicely, but those two in particular. And then finally, international, as I mentioned, it grew 69% year-over-year. So, in EMEA, in particular, which is an area that we continue to develop, build agency relationships as well as a book of business across both channels, our large customer and mid-market channels. So, each of these, I think, is contributing growth drivers. We are adding new advertisers. Every quarter, there are thousands of new advertisers onto our platform. Now it's not at the levels that we think is possible. I think that TAM is really large compared to where we are today. There are many more lines of business and thousands more advertisers that can be on our platform, but we are adding them and acquiring new customers onto the platform. So those are obviously seeds that are planted for the future while we continue to grow our base book of business. So, I think both were contributors. Thanks for the question, Rich. Just we've always said this, we don't manage to ARPU. It's just -- it's an output, right? It's an output of revenue users and user mix. User mix being things like what geographies the users are in, the mix of logged in and logged out. So, all of those are sort of drivers of ARPU we don't manage to it. Look, our revenue growth, it's -- like I said before, it's driven by advertisers finding the outcomes they want the volumes and prices they want. And we are -- we have really differentiated revenue growth, and we feel really good about that. We also have really differentiated user growth. which we feel really good about. And like we said, we don't focus on ARPU quarter-to-quarter, although we do see headroom in the future over time because we do believe in the value of Reddit users and over time, Reddit users actually increase in engagement as they come in and spend more time with us. So, another way to think about it is the bedrock of our inventory is logged in users. And we do continue to grow the value of our most valuable users who are those logged in users. And there's been very steady growth in those logged-in users. And so, it's just another way to think about it. So again, we don't manage to it, but we do see the headroom in the future over time. I think you're asking about monetizing conversation placements. I think look, we're testing ads and comments right now. I think we're still early in both, honestly, the design of that page from a consumer experiences point of view, where I think there's a lot of opportunity in thinking happening because it's such a high-intent page where people are searching for information. And I think we're early in designing the ad format that is appropriate for the different sections of that page. The part of the post, which we launched couple of years ago and the ads in common. So, I think there's a lot of opportunity there. That's about -- that's a minority of our inventory today, but is growing in terms of engagement. So, I do think that, that's an opportunity. But we move both of those things in tandem. And I think there's a lot more actually that we want to do with that page in terms of the experience of when users come in and are guiding and working through the -- getting the information that they want and going deeper and the ad experience will follow that. So, there's headroom there. Again, we don't look at -- we are interested in designing ad formats, but ad load is not a lever that we focus on. We're really focused on designing formats and making sure we're delivering performance against the increasing users that we've seen on to the platform. So, our inventory really grows with that reach. Yes. Thanks, Eric. It's a number of things. So end-to-end for performance, we're still continuing on our CAPI drive. It's really important. Measurement is incredibly important to performance. That's proceeding really nicely, but it takes time. We want ideally 100% of our conversion revenue covered by a measurement like CAPI, but we're not there yet. So that's an IT-driven process with our customers, but measurement is incredibly important. The second is automation simplicity. So, I think we have now developed a product that is market competitive in terms of performance outcomes. That's great. We'll continue to chip away at that and improve performance for advertisers quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, and that's what the market demands and allow them to scale, especially with the increased reach of our users. That's great. But it has to be simple in order for smaller advertisers to take advantage of that, which means automation, really end-to-end simplicity and we're not there yet. That's something that we're building more end-to-end automation in the world of performance. But that will unlock more advertisers. The third is in the lower funnel is shopping. Shopping is just a -- it's a different sub-objective within the lower funnel performance. It requires catalog ingest, its own machine learning models, more complicated measurement and we're building that capability, but it's a longer journey to sort of birth that objective, something we believe in for Reddit, but that's also something that I think would bolster our lower funnel. So those three things. Yes. Thanks for asking. So, we started -- we launched a couple of quarters ago a headline generator using gen AI where you can just put in the URL from your website, and it actually gives you Reddity headlines that actually drive improved ad performance and having Reddity type headlines in your ads really does make a difference in the ad resonance. So that's just an example of, I think, what's possible in terms of ad creative. We did acquire a company called Memorable AI. Their specialty is in understanding the components of creative and how they drive performance might be the -- is it a hero image, the color of the image, the type of text, et cetera. So, they drive the insights in how to optimize creative. We have an ability -- we want to take that and integrate into our ad stack, and the next step would be having those insights tied to a gen AI capability to actually do the work based on those insights. So, it's early in that we just acquired them, and we're integrating them into our asset, but we do see a very fulsome and exciting road map related to ad creative in terms of gen AI. The other automation that you'll see that is coming in the platform is going to really be around with a little bit of AI on top in terms of the end-to-end performance, that's taking steps out of the tool to make things easier to execute in terms of campaign setup and campaign optimization. Sure. Yes, I would say that the conversation placement compared to the feed still has less demand in that placement because it's newer. And we are testing ads in comments. So, we'll be adding some ad load into that page and obviously, adoption for a new ad unit like that does take time. But there are ways that we've been growing that demand. So, for example, I mentioned earlier the multi-placement optimization, where customers can get the benefit of us optimizing across both pieces of inventory, especially when they're looking for a specific outcome that's helped increase demand fluidly across these two surfaces because what the advertiser really wants is the outcome, and they're sort of more indifferent to the placement. And so that's helping advertisers get acquainted with the performance in that unit where we can fluidly optimize for them and take some friction out and having to set up different ad groups, et cetera, and think about those two ad units and we sort of adjust the creative and the optimization across both. So, I do think that there is increased demand. We're seeing good increased demand against that unit. But of course, we're also seeing a lot of supply, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of the engagement on that page. So, they're moving in tandem. The good news is there's incredible opportunity on that page. That page is extremely contextual, extremely high intent. It is a high converting page with great outcomes. And we're still early in the ad formats and designing the ads for that page. So, it's just incredible opportunity. Yes. Happy to talk about the ad stack. So, for '25, I would say we're continuing on the same journey in terms of our strategy, right? We want to be a full funnel solution for advertisers. We want to deliver market competitive outcomes across brand and performance advertising. And I think we're doing that in the objectives that we have across brands, some impressions, brand lift middle of the funnel for traffic and lower funnel in terms of key conversions, things like at the card purchase and then app install. So, there's more there. We're just at the beginning of that journey. There's more that we can do in terms of our modelling. There's more that we can do on measurement, like we can add modelling to measurement. There's a lot more that we can do to give more value and more scale to advertisers in those objectives. And remember, that can all scale with user growth. So, it's a really nice position to be in. and we will deliver more efficient. It's still efficiencies driven market. So, we will still deliver more efficiency and return on ad spend to them next year, which will help them scale their work with us. In addition to that, we see an opportunity to enhance the brand part of our proposition. On the brand side, we've always been very successful because of the high engagement and the big unduplicated reach on a monthly basis. And brand has an opportunity to be a lot more automated and have a lot more selection in terms of the optimizations for advertisers like optimizing to reach our lowest cost, the things that we've given to advertisers on the performance side that drive some automation from them, not end-to-end automation, but automation on the optimization to make it easy. We can do that in brand as well. And so that will be something that we're investing in. The second is on the lower funnel, while we have a really nice foundation in conversions in app install, we want to build out shopping, as I mentioned before. That's just another capability in the lower funnel that I think can get advertisers another way to talk to customers. So that would be the second piece. And the third, which I think we're now at the moment that we can do, which is the end-to-end automation. And you've seen this with Advantages and Performance Max from Google. It really does make optimization campaign set up much simpler and scalable for advertisers. In order to do that, there's two steps. Like you have to have every part of the ad stack in place before you automate over it. And the second is you need to build a certain amount of trust with your customers before you automate all of those activities so that they really understand what's happening at each step. I think we are there at that point. And so, we've been investing and starting to put together these items into a more automated experience. So those are the three things that we've been starting to invest in, in the background and think about as we go into '25 on top of the continuing road map from this year in terms of delivering the market competitive performance. Thanks for the question. Yes, I'd say, look, probably when we last spoke, I had some caution about Q4 around the election. And what I would say is, I think the -- it doesn't seem to be affecting bookings. I think there is caution around delivery timing. So, there might be advertisers who are going to be a little quiet for certain periods of time, but it doesn't seem to affect their interest in growing their business with us in Q4 and continuing their advertising. So, I think that's where at least what we've seen so far. '25, it's early, but I would say the signals are that it's stable that there's probably some optimism. I think most folks at the Holocaust will say that they're going to be up in general, unless there's been major client or share shift, which I think is good. And I think brand advertising has been really healthy. And we've seen strength across all our objectives. I think it's still an efficiency-driven market. So I do think at the mid- and lower funnel, there are still pressure to improve ROAS year-on-year. But I do think that there is healthy interest and investment in brand. which I think is always a good sign. So I think the full funnel is actually all in a healthy place in terms of investment. That's our view so far. So I mean, ARPU is going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. That's just the reality of being focused on revenue growth and user growth. And so I don't necessarily read too much into quarter-over-quarter movements in ARPU, but yes, I mean, the drivers of ARPU in general are in terms of -- it's definitely things like pricing, and ad formats or ad load or obviously contributors to ARPU growth. The way I think about it is our business has really grown significantly in the mid- and lower front. And you do that by growing volume of clicks and conversions, which increases the value per impression that an advertiser gets, right? And it's increasing their return and the efficiency that we're delivering to them and that just increases the value of every impression because of the click volume and the conversions that they're seeing from advertising on Reddit. So, I do think that delivering performance is definitely helpful for advertisers and for us in delivering return on ad spend for advertisers which drives demand, which drives spending and which can drive pricing and competition and interest in those objectives and scaling those objectives. So I do think it's driven by a lot of the work we've done in the ad stack to deliver performance. Sure. So as Steve mentioned before, our go-to-market is kind of a barbell. We have discussions with a small group of folks who are developing training AI models. The other side is maybe marketing intelligence firms or verticals who are interested in slices of Reddit data, and those tend to be smaller deals, but more volume. And the training folks, there's usually a combination of both freshness that they're interested in as well as the total corpus of information to train on. Look, I think that we continue to -- we're -- we continue to talk to like what I'd say is a small group of folks who are in the world of AI training. It's a really evolving landscape. Many of those companies are trying to figure out their own strategies, what their product is going to be, what they're building, how they're investing, how Reddit fits into it. So, I think we are -- it's well known that a there to help and be a thought partner in this, et cetera. But I think it is an evolving landscape where they're sifting out their strategies, and we're a part of that strategy. So that's just where we are in the landscape. The other side of the go-to-market, it's a very small team, but is out there talking to marketing intelligence companies and also looking at some verticals. There, what we're doing is we're both engaging who would be the client, the customer to us as well as their end customers, right? So, if your marketing intelligence term, you might have customers who are brands and companies. If you're a financial services firm, you might have an end customer who's financial services firm. And there, what we're doing is really helping them show the value to their end customers and make sure that their end customers have a great experience in understanding what the Reddit data -- how the Reddit data can bring value. And that's how we sort of grow that business. We get more people excited about what you can learn and the insights you can get from Reddit data and to continue to see value in it and so that's what that work looks like."

And now I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Huffman: Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Q2 was another strong quarter for Reddit in our communities. We kept up our momentum with both strong business performance and progress on the product. In Q2, both users and revenue grew over 50% year-over-year. And for the second consecutive quarter, we had positive cash flow and we're profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis. User growth has continued to climb, reaching new heights with over 342 million active users and more than 91 million daily active users. More and more people are coming to Reddit to explore their interests, engage in conversations and find their communities. And increasingly, users are turning to Reddit for answers to their questions via search, recognizing the authenticity and trustworthiness of our content across a wide variety of topics. Our product work is focused on enhancing the user experience to make Reddit faster, safer and easier to use. Conversations are the heart of Reddit, and we've improved our app with near instant comment loading and more intuitive navigation across different post types, including text, video and images. The recent improvements bring users into conversations faster and more often, driving more engagement on the platform. The number of comments viewed reached a new high, up 10% from Q1 to Q2. Over the years, we've hosted some notable Ask Me Anything sessions, ranging from U.S. presidents to celebrities and sports figures to regular people with interesting stories. We introduced several updates to the AMA feature, making it easier for a host to schedule and post and easier for users to participate. During the pilot, we've seen hundreds of new AMAs created, including those with high-profile brands and artists. These product updates tie into our advertising strategy, allowing us to test new conversation ad placements and AMA ads, which are high-intent services for brands and businesses to reach their audience. As the platform continues to scale, so does our need for safety and moderation tools. Using AI, we are reducing the moderation burden and making Reddit's platform safer at scale. We're evolving what the day-to-day looks like for moderators on Reddit, allowing them to spend more time engaging and growing their communities. International expansion remains a top priority and one of our largest opportunities. 50% of our current user base is outside of the U.S., and we believe we can scale this meaningfully over time. International growth was a key driver in Q2, both in users and revenue. International daily active users exceeded 45 million, growing 44% year-over-year and 11% from Q1. This was led by focus countries like France, India, the U.K. and the Philippines, where we're seeing good results with our growth strategies, including through machine translation. Immersive=machine translation is now widely available in French, and as a result, France was one of our fastest growing countries surpassing growth in the U.S. We will now begin to expand machine translation to German, Spanish and Portuguese, aiming to make Reddit accessible to everyone regardless of their native language. Looking ahead, we're making progress across our emerging initiatives, including the user economy, search and data licensing. Starting with the user economy. We're excited to have our developer platform out to public beta with a few hundred active developers. In Q2, we saw growing engagement with about 3x more custom post use than in Q1, including scoreboards and stock tickers in our international sports and investing communities. We're working towards enabling monetization within the developer platform to empower our users to create and earn money on the platform this year. I look forward to sharing more about this in the coming quarters. Okay. Next, let's discuss our opportunity in search. Reddit's content is uniquely valuable and becoming more important in the context of Internet search. Users run over 1 billion search queries a month on Reddit today, and our product work is improving the search experience and success rate on the platform. Later this year, we will begin testing new search result pages powered by AI to summarize and recommend content, helping users dive deeper into product shows, games and discover new communities on Reddit. Turning to third-party search. We're seeing an evolution in the search ecosystem where Internet search, summarization and training are blending. We are seeking the right balance between openness and protecting our users and platform. Our partnerships with Google and OpenAI align with our public content policies and uphold our belief in the connected Internet, helping people find what they're looking for and to discover communities on Reddit. Our preference is for Reddit it to be open and indexed in third-party search, and we are in discussions with both big and small search engines towards this end. However, some players in ecosystem have not been transparent with their use of Reddit's content. And in those instances, we've blocked access to protect Reddit content and user privacy. We believe the Internet and search are better with Reddit's content and we remain open to finding solutions that are mutually beneficial to our users, Reddit and the broader Internet community. To wrap up, I'm happy with the progress we've made in our first two quarters as a public company. We're still early in our journey with many opportunities and opportunities for execution ahead to fulfill our mission. Thank you again for being a part of this journey with us. And now, I'll hand it over to Jen.\nJen Wong: Okay. Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for revenue. Total revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $281.2 million and accelerated from the prior quarter and the fastest year-over-year growth rate since Q1 2022. The investments we made across the business continue to pay off, and we're pleased with the results in the first half of the year. The ad business continues to scale in Q2 and accelerated from the prior quarter as we executed on our strategies and saw a stable ad market. Ad revenue grew 41% year-over-year to $253.1 million. We made progress scaling and diversifying the business, expanding partnerships and executing on our AdTech road map. Let me discuss our ad revenue drivers. We saw double-digit year-over-year growth in impressions from personalized ad loads, underlying user growth and product enhancements to drive ad efficiency against a year-over-year decline in pricing. We continue to diversify our business across channels, verticals and geographies. The global scale channel, including mid-market and SMB grew over 50% year-over-year, driven by both new advertiser activation and by deepening existing relationships. Strength in our verticals was led by retail, pharma and financial services, which each grew over 50% year-over-year. International revenue accelerated from the prior quarter and grew 49% year-over-year, driven by strength across large and mid-market customers in EMEA. And the big six agency relationships were also growth drivers in the quarter. Our Q2 growth was across the full funnel. Performance objectives drove more than half of our revenue in the quarter and we more than doubled the number of clicks again as we continue to enhance the lower funnel capabilities of our full funnel advertising business. We made measurable progress against our AdTech road map in Q2. We focused on: number one, driving performance of our ad solutions; number two, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity for our sales force; and number three, offering our advertisers Reddit unique solutions and bringing them closer to our communities. Now let me discuss each. First, driving performance of our ad solutions. We continued building out our conversion API ecosystem with a new partnership with mParticle. This adds to our partnerships with Google Tag Manager and Tealium as we execute our one-to-many approach for CAP adoption. We launched a performance ad solution, Dynamic Product Ads or DPA, to public data. Early adopters have seen about a 2x higher return on ad spend, or ROAS, compared to other conversion campaigns. Now, it's still early for this solution, and we'll continue to invest in improving performance with this new solution. And we recently announced the acquisition of Memorable AI, which helps accelerate our road map to bring AI-driven intelligence tools and ad creative to our advertisers to help drive performance. With this acquisition, we're adding AI foundational models to our ad stack to help optimize creative, and we are working towards integration beginning to have impact next year. Second, improving usability for our users and productivity for our sales force. We've launched our Reddit ads API to GA, allowing partners and advertisers to integrate with Reddit's ad manager and build customized campaigns and analytics, which help to expand our platform's reach. Sprinklr is the first marketing intelligence platform to integrate with both Reddit's ads API and data API, offering advertisers unique insights and capabilities. In Q2, we extended our partnership with DoubleVerify and announced a new partnership with IAS to provide advertisers with brand safety and suitability measurement complementing our robust first-party brand safety controls and fostering transparency and trust with the major brands. Third, offering our advertisers ready unique solutions and bringing them closer to communities. We expanded ad placements on the conversation page, a high intent and valuable surface for both our users and advertisers and where nearly 50% of all screen views occur. We launched the test of ads between comments and a new refreshed set of ad formats for conversation ads that are driving higher click-through rates and early testing. Advertisers using both in feed and conversation ads experience a lift in action intent compared to those using old in-feed ads. We also invested in bringing new content types to our users and offering businesses and advertisers new ways to reach and engage with communities. In Q2, we launched the next-generation version of our Ask Me Anything, AMA product, resulting in hundreds of new AMAs created. Businesses are hosting AMA and promoting them with ads to engage with communities and to share more about their brands and products. We also announced a partnership program, which brings sports content to Reddit's ad communities, including highlight videos, AMAs and behind the scenes material. This helps drive engagement on the platform and offers new ad format and placements for our advertisers. Sports are global interest and a category that our users are deeply passing about with over 1,000 active sports communities on Reddit, partnering with Sports League was a natural place to start. And we'll see how this program unfolds later this year and consider how we might expand to other verticals and categories in the future. Next, I'll shift to our data licensing business. Other revenue grew over 690% year-over-year to $28.1 million, primarily driven by data licensing agreements signed in the first half of the year. This market is still evolving, and we are exploring agreements of partners across the landscape who are aligned with our public content and user privacy policies and where there is commercial alignment. Through recent partnerships with Sprinklr and OpenAI make Reddit's corpus of authentic conversations available for these partners to access, while also putting guardrails in place that protect our users' privacy and bred its content. To date, our data licensing strategy has focused on marketing intelligence platforms and large-scale enterprise technology and search company, and we made good progress addressing these markets. We'll continue to explore opportunities with new verticals and potential ways to work with additional large and smaller scale emerging AI companies. Overall, this was a good first half of the year for Reddit, and we've made a lot of progress. Our focus now turns to the back half of the year as we work to continue growing the business. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew.\nDrew Vollero: Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. Reddit delivered very strong second quarter results across the board, which built on the sound start in Q1 and rounded out a solid first half of the year. In the quarter, three key financial themes developed: first, our most important growth and cost metrics really shined; second, our profitability continues to inflect rapidly as our business scales; third, we saw continued traction on important economic drivers like cash flow, CapEx, dilution and stock-based compensation. Let's speak to each point starting first with strength and key metrics, specifically users, revenues, gross margins and OpEx. We saw really solid growth in the quarter with both user growth and revenue growth exceeding 50% year-over-year. The DAUq was $91.2 million, up 51%, logged out users were about 70% of the end quarter growth, but total logged-in users grew 31% year-over-year, the fastest rate in the last few years. Revenues were $281 million, up 54% as impression gains continue to fuel our growth. Ad revenue grew 41% in Q2, while other revenue grew over 690%, primarily driven by new licensing deals with Google, OpenAI and others. Margin growth also really shined in the quarter. Gross margins were nearly 90%, up from 84% in the prior year, driven by operating efficiencies, lower pricing from our cloud hosting contracts and the leverage from incremental revenues. For Q2, our 12% adjusted OpEx cost growth is very consistent with the last four quarters where adjusted OpEx growth has averaged about 9%. The Company continues to leverage the organizational scale it's built over the last few years as we targeted modest hiring in the front of house areas like AdTech, machine learning and sales. Total headcount was up less than 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. So, as you can see, terrific traction on key metrics. Second, let me touch on how profitability is inflecting rapidly as the business scales. On a GAAP basis, our net loss was $10 million, $31 million better than prior year and very solid progress against our internal goal of reaching GAAP breakeven. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was nearly $40 million, up $30 million sequentially and up $75 million year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins reached the mid-double-digit level at 14% up from 4% in Q1 and negative 19% in the prior year. The key to our significant gains in profitability continue to be both execution and our strong economic model. Revenue grew over 5x as fast as total adjusted costs in Q2, similar to Q1 as revenues grew 54% year-over-year and total adjusted costs grew slightly less than 11% year-over-year. That's well ahead of our long-term internal goal of revenue growth twice as fast as total adjusted cost growth. Now relatedly, our incremental adjusted EBITDA margins were 76% for the quarter, slightly higher than our last four quarter average of 73%. In Q2, we saw a $75 million positive change in adjusted EBITDA on a $98 million change in revenue. Now to the third point, we're not only seeing good traction in areas like growth and costs, but also on important metrics like cash flow, CapEx, stock-based compensation and dilution. Operating cash flow was $28 million in Q2, an $82 million positive change from Q2 of 2023. For the first half of the year, positive operating cash flow was $60 million. Our CapEx remains very light, about $1 million in the second quarter, less than 1% of revenue. Stock-based compensation, including related taxes, was $67 million, down substantially from the last quarter due to the recognition of IPO-related stock expenses. Stock-based compensation was about 24% of revenue for the quarter. Share count movements were modest in Q2 as basic shares outstanding were $166 million, up 1% sequentially, but fully diluted shares were $205 million, down sequentially. On the other hand, cash was $1.7 billion, which gives us a lot of flexibility as our business scales into profitability and positive cash flow. In medium term, we believe the right amount of cash on hand for the business today is around $800 million to $1 billion. The Company will look to deploy capital where it makes sense over time with capital priorities being: first, investing in our business, M&A and share repurchases. As Jen mentioned, we recently completed and announced the acquisition of Memorable AI and ad creative optimization platform to help drive lower funnel performance for our advertisers. The preliminary purchase price consideration was $19.9 million, including $17.1 million of cash. The deal closed in late July and will be reflected in the Q3 financial statements. As we look ahead, we'll share our internal thoughts on revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, where we have the greatest date of visibility. For the third quarter 2024, we estimate revenue in the range of $290 million to $310 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $60 million. These estimates include the anticipated benefits from the recently signed content partnerships with the sports leagues. We anticipate these deals will contribute modestly to revenue this year, more in Q4 than Q3 and should have a greater financial impact in 2025 and beyond. So, to summarize, the strength and consistency of the numbers were nice to see throughout the first half of 2024. Both Q1 and Q2 were solid quarters for Reddit. That said, our business historically scales seasonally, and we've turned our attention and focus to the back half of 2024. Now let me turn the call over to Steve.\nA - Steve Huffman: Thanks, Drew. Thanks, Jen. Okay. We're going to do two questions from our community, and then we'll open it up to everybody else. First question, in past interviews, you have mentioned using large language models to translate Reddit's content into other languages to better connect Reddit's communities internationally. Is this something that is being actively built or just a vision for a distant future. So, it's something that's being built. It's testing and for French, which was our first language for doing this, it's now in GA, or general availability, which means if you're -- in France, speaking French minus a small holdout group, you can see the full immersive real-time translation experience. And it's working very well. So now we're kicking off German, Spanish and Portuguese with our aim to get those out later this year as well. Long story short, the test was successful. This is a really promising feature. And so, it's real, and I think it should have an impact in the short term. Second question, I'll read and this one's for Jen. Advertising is the prime source of revenue for Reddit. To increase this revenue, do you plan to focus on increasing the quantity, number of ads, or quality, profit generated per ad, of ads featured on Reddit.\nJen Wong: Steve. So, what's important to growing revenue in our auction is that advertisers find the outcomes they want at the volumes and price they want. And our ads platform and marketplace is still early, still young. So, we do see opportunity to drive more demand and performance which can drive more value per ad or CPM, cost per thousand impressions. As load on Reddit, where there are ad today, like in the feed, for example, is light compared to peers. And the best we can tell outside in is about half of peer platforms. But there are still many places on Reddit without ads today. So, we're more focused on designing ads for spaces where users are spending more time versus increasing ad load in existing spaces. So, for example, 50% of screen views, they're now in conversation stages, that's an opportunity.\nSteve Huffman: Okay. Thanks, Jen. For the community questions, Jen, Drew and I will record answers to the rest of them and post them tomorrow. Okay. Jesse, back to you.\nJesse Rose: Great. Thanks, Steve. Thanks, Jen. Krista, why don't we open up the line, take some questions from the folks that are on the line now. Appreciate it.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nDoug Anmuth: One for Drew and one for Steve. Drew, I was hoping you could provide some more color on the 3Q guide, in particular, any more insight into the ad market and the health in the third quarter. Just -- it looks like the revenue outlook is either very conservative or perhaps you're seeing something in the business because if you back out OpenAI incremental contribution and then perhaps even some of the sports league benefits as well. It doesn't suggest much sequential growth in revenue. So, I was just checking if there's anything to call out there. And then, Steve, you talked about testing new search results pages. Can you just elaborate there? Is this going to be done all internally? Or are you partnering with third-party providers here as well?\nDrew Vollero: Okay. On the guide, Doug here, we guided 290 to 310. If you take the midpoint of that year-over-year growth is mid-40s. We think that's a good number. We think that's differentiated versus the pure set. If you look over the last four quarters, we've been growing in the mid- to high 30s. So, we feel like it's a differentiated number. I take your point that your measurement stake is a bit different. You're looking just only at the second quarter. So, I take your point there. In terms of the revenue drivers that you're looking at sort of the incrementality of them. Look, I think that the sports deals are something that's probably a bigger idea for us in 2025 and beyond. We have to get that sold through our sales force, et cetera. So, I would look for a very modest impact in Q3. I think we'll have a little bit more, particularly with the NFL in the fourth quarter. That's kind of the main part of the NFL season. So, I think that incrementality in the third quarter will be pretty modest. As it relates to kind of OpenAI, we saw about half the benefit of the deal in the second quarter. So, there will be a little bit of incrementality to your point. But overall, I think the guide feels good. Are there particular things that we're looking at in the third quarter that we can put our finger on? No, there isn't anything that's particularly different than what we've seen. Now for the full year, there still is some macro uncertainty and particularly in the fourth quarter around elections. So, I think that's a little bit in the background. But I think overall in the third quarter, I think the guide feels good to where the business is right now feels better than where we've been over the last four quarters. But I do take your point, it's a little bit lower than we've been in the second quarter, but I think we take a little broader lens than that.\nSteve Huffman: Okay. Thanks, Doug. Second question about search. So, we're talking about on Reddit search. A lot of our work over the last couple of years has been on the back end. So improving the actual results, so the speed and relevance of those results. Some of that is on first-party technology. Some of that is third-party technology. We're also beginning to enhance the results with AI. Again, some of those are first-party models. Some of those will be third-party models. And what I was really referring to in my script is the rest of this year, we'll start to see the front-end product actually change, so the user experience and how we package these results because that's gone unchanged for a long time. Search on Reddit is a huge opportunity. Many new users run a search. You've heard me talk about onboarding, helping connect users to their interest on Reddit. For many users, they're literally typing into a box exactly what they're interested in. So it's, I think, really important consumer product service area. And then, of course, over the long term, there's significant advertising potential there as well. But really, what I'm referring to here is -- it will be our in-house efforts to improve the presentation of that product.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nLaura Martin: I will be your request to only have one question. So, I'm going to ask one of Steve. Putting on your protector of culture hat, Steve, Historically, these are conversations and there hasn't been a hidden agenda about earning money. And you guys are going to try to earn money now for people and creators on the platform which sort of moves it more towards a Twitch or a YouTube in fine line. So, how do you protect this wonderful unique culture of Reddit? At the same time, you're going to let people make money from these conversations.\nSteve Huffman: Thank you, Laura. Great question. So yes, I think one of the truly special and honestly, almost magical things about Reddit is the amount of time and effort people spend helping each other, giving advice, helping people through decisions sometimes small decisions, which should I watch tonight, sometimes big decisions like should I go through this breakup. It's really, I think, truly profound. Your question is if we start to include other incentives in there, like monetary incentives, does that change. In my experience on Reddit, whenever we add basically a new way of using Reddit, what happens is it expands Reddit, but we've not seen it cannibalize existing Reddit. And so, I think the existing altruistic-free version of Reddit will continue to exist and grow and thrive just the way it has. But now we will unlock the door for new use cases, new types of subreddits that can be built that may have exclusive content or private areas, things of that nature. A good example of this, for example is, at Reddit, we didn't host images back in the past. It was all text and links and images were linked. So, we'd link to other websites or platforms for images. When we added image hosting, all of a sudden, there's a ton of new communities built around that feature, but the existing text and link-based Reddit also continued to grow. So, I'd look at this as an opportunity of expansion as opposed to one that is going to cannibalize the existing Reddit, which as I said, is magical. It's something that we think is truly precious. And so, we'll, of course, watch these things closely, but that's how we see it playing out.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with Citi. Please go ahead.\nRon Josey: I wanted to ask on usage and in advertising. Steve, I think we saw logged in DAUs up 32%, maybe amongst the fastest growth in the past couple of years and we saw comments also, comments viewed, I think, up as well. So, I wanted to hear about the changes the team has made on the site itself, whether it be Shred-It, new onboarding processes that have driven this and really curious about the lasting implications here. And then, Jen, you mentioned the stable ad market. We saw each other a few weeks back over con. Can I just wanted to hear your conversations with advertisers have evolved really over the past few months just in terms of how the dynamic has changed in terms of advertising on Reddit.\nSteve Huffman: Okay. Ron, thank you for the questions. Yes, as you observed, logs in DAU is up over 30% last year. That is indeed our fastest growth rate among that segment in years. So, we're very happy with that. And you answered your own question, improved onboarding, Shred-it, which represents web performance. I would say broadly a general push around quality on Red it has helped a lot. And then there is a structural change that we've been going through over the last couple of years, which is it used to be when you're a new user to Reddit, we were putting you into basically global feed. So we call that the popular feed today. That was the core Reddit product for the first maybe 15 years of our life. And now what happens is we get you into the community onboarding experience. And so, we try to find the interest specific to you. And then we put you in a home feed that has those communities in subreddit, and we grow from there. And so that first user experience has gotten much more dialed in and relevant to new users, which has been driving meaningful improvements to new user retention and of course, that compounds and the growth. And so, the story of it I think for a long time is we've had this very big top of funnel from third-party search and word of mouth. And the question has been, can we retain those users because we get so many shots on goal every day. So really, over the last year, we've gotten much better at retaining new users, and we've been growing over 1 million users a month more or less since spring of last year. Jen, there was a second question on the stable ad market.\nJen Wong: Yes. I think we saw a stable ad market in Q2, Ron. I'd say post can, I think -- first of all, I think can have very strong sentiment post. Can was working with Shred-It, it's a very, very positive. Look, we're watching a few things. We're watching inflation, geopolitics, elections. I will say a few things. One, there are real election jitters. We did see some pauses in the U.K. around the snap election, we saw pauses around the time of the Trump rally shooting. So, I think there's a lot of caution. I will also say that recently, agencies have signaled a little bit of back half caution budgets being more flattish versus growing. So, I think there is caution from the large holdcos, and we're not a big player in political ads, which some might have a political bump, but that's not something that we play in. That's kind of how I think about the back half. So overall, I think it is -- if there's still a little bit maybe more cautious but I think we're still well positioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nBrian Nowak: I want to go back to the ad markets, Jen. Can you talk to us about sort of what you're seeing on your branded advertiser spend? Are you still seeing your advertisers who are mostly branded spent? Are they spending more on the branded side? And so, sort of what's driving that -- then just sort of any update you can give us, I remember the pre-IPO. Walk us through sort of progress on growing your advertiser count, growing your advertiser spend, your advertiser spend per advertiser over time? Anything you kind of help us kind of what's going on actually beneath the headlines on driving this really strong ad growth in the 3Q.\nJen Wong: Sure. Happy to. So just on your question on the brand. Brand as an objective was growing really nicely for us. And in fact, I think brand, we've seen both folks come into the auction, so fitting against brand objectives as well as using our takeover product, which is a reserve product where they can align against specific subreddits, so specifically the category takeovers, you can buy category like sports, et cetera. So, we see brand advertisers come into both of those products as well as nice adoption of some of the Reddit unique formats like AMA that have been refreshed in the free format. So, brand has actually been solid as an objective, and there is really diversified spend across brand and performance. In terms of the underlying pieces of our business, I think it's really healthy in a number of ways. So, number one is we've been growing the number of active advertisers, particularly in the managed segment that has for large customers in mid-market and managed SMB. And those are really seeds for the future because you start small and you can grow those advertisers in some more products and more objectives. So that, I think, allows us to plant seeds for the future. The second is we had a number of growth drivers across our business. The scale part, mid-market and SMB growing over 50%, international becoming a growth driver, 49% year-over-year, vertical diversification. So, it used to be that our tech group was our number one vertical group. This quarter, it actually was the group that included retail, pharma, financial services, CPG, so really interesting. That diversification continues in our booking, it's actually changing the face of our book, I think, which has been really positive. And so -- and then the final thing I'll say is we've been investing in the lower funnel and specifically converging and that has accelerated in growth as an objective in our auction. So that's really nice to see because as that objective delivers more performance, that allows an unlock for more advertisers, particularly in the scale channel. So, I think the business is really healthy. We're doing a good job retaining at high rates or managed advertisers as well as adding new advertisers to the book because of the new platform capabilities.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nEric Sheridan: The topic really is Memorable AI. Can you talk a little bit about why you felt that was the right asset for you as a team to acquire? How you thought about building organically around that broader theme versus maybe accelerating the path to market and going down the acquisition route and how we should be thinking about that asset being integrated and having an impact on the business in the years ahead?\nJen Wong: Sure. So, one of the layers in our ad stack that we want to develop and that was on our road map is around creative, both insights and optimization and then creative generation. we know that, that can be really valuable for driving performance and also just making an easier, more automated, scalable experience for advertisers. It is something that we had on our road map that we could build, but acquiring Memorable, which is one of the leaders in the market, I mean, all of our deals just showed how much customers value their technology and insight it just accelerates our ability to come -- to add this part of the ad stack. So, we're integrating -- we get technology and talent with the acquisition, and we're doing that integration work in the back half of this year to start having impact next year, but it will really accelerate our ability to deliver performance at the lower end of the funnel, in particular. I mean it will help all the performance, but particularly at the lower end of the lower funnel where ad formats and creative can have a lot of impact on quicker rates and conversions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with LightShed. Please go ahead.\nRich Greenfield: I got a couple of questions. Steve, you talked about sort of the improving engagement in sort of that upper funnel, which I assume you're talking about sort of how search drives people into the platform. But your DAU -- or your weekly users are still growing faster than your daily users. And I guess the question is how do you close that gap over time? Is it product changes? Like it's obviously great that you have all of these people coming and touching Reddit every single week. But how do you get them to be addicted and become daily active users? What is that -- like is there something that you've seen historically that sort of convert somebody from either a search-based user or someone who comes in once in a while to an actual daily user. And then just to, I wanted to follow up on, I think you've made a comment about CPM's pricing being down. Is that the same issue that you, sort of, are seeing in ARPU? Is it just simply that the users year-over-year are just growing too quickly and you can't keep up with the overall growth of the platform? Any just color on given how early you are, what's happening on the CPM side of pricing on the advertising side from Jen would be great.\nSteve Huffman: Great. Okay. Rich, thanks. I'll take the first half. Jen will take the second half. So, look, let's -- first things first. We're happy with growth. Weekly is growing, daily is growing, logged in, logged out growing, so I think we're in a good position there. I think your observation is correct. Weeklys and of course, monthlys even more so, can be more volatile because they can be more affected by third-party search or events in the news and what have you. And of course, we want to grow dailys, and that's really how we operate the Company is growing dailys. But we don't think necessarily about how do we convert weekly to dailys. We think about it a little bit differently, which is how do we retain the dailys that we see on the platform every day. both the new users, getting them to come back at all and the core user is getting them to come back more. And our work there is -- it's hard work, but it's easy to explain. Relevancy, ML, onboarding product quality. Do you see something -- a very simple question? Do you see something in your first session on Reddit that is uniquely engaging? One assumption that I would caution against making is that search users, third-party search users, many of them are core users. So, they're using other search engines to effectively navigate Reddit, and I include myself in that cohort. But there are a number of logged out users or new potential users that come from search. And I think of that experience is there learning that Reddit, over time, has the answers to their questions. They may not be in that session looking to join a community. That's maybe a little bit of a heavier experience. But eventually, we get them through the front door. They'll come -- they'll download our app, but they'll come to the website. And then that's where everything I mentioned around relevancy and product quality come into play to retain those users. And we're growing retention and we're growing DAU. So, we're happy with that result. And then there's another interesting dynamic on Reddit, which is the longer somebody has their account, the more time they actually spend on Reddit. They join more communities and they go deeper and deeper. And so, users on Reddit where they maybe on other platforms age out, they actually age into Reddit and spend more time over the course of years. So I think this is a really powerful trend. Okay. Jen, the second half of the question was the interplay between users and ARPU and users in CPM.\nJen Wong: Sure. So, Richard, look, nobody manages in the Company of two. We managed revenue growth, we managed the DAU growth and we're in the, I think, fortunate position of having really strong revenue and user growth with users being a little bit more, and that's why ARPU is down. But I think when I look at the headroom that we have, I think we've been growing share in the top row around the revenue side and I think continue to have headroom on ARPU. So, I think it may be a first-class problem that we have in the map. On the CPM side, what's really driving the decline in CPMs is the placement on the conversation page. So that's a newer unit that -- and then -- and so the -- right now, we're still building demand for that unit. And there are a couple of things we're doing to do that. So one is educating the market about that unit. It's very unique. It's very different than anything else in the market. In fact, most people don't -- most platforms don't have an add-in comment, partially because the comments aren't the best part of their platform. They are the best part of Reddit, but there's some reeducation to be done. The second is that we've actually refreshed that format so that it has a broader set of creative capability. One of the things that our advertisers wanted is just a little more functionality in that format. So, we've recently released that, and they'll be able to take advantage of it. I think that can increase demand. And then finally, we're testing ad inside the comments. So that adds some more inventory to that page that there's very low demand for it because it's been testing. It's very new. It's just experimental. So obviously, that wouldn't have high CPMs in that unit yet. So when you look at the page, but I think I mentioned earlier that 50% of screen views are now on the conversation page. So the traffic is really going to that page, which is a great high intent, highly contextual page, but we have to match the demand through the flow of the ad impressions on that page. So we'll continue to grow the demand on this new unit. I think it's a really good unit high performing, but it will take time for the demand to catch up with the supply that's been generated. That's why you see the differential in CPMs.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Boone: You guys have seen an influx of new users just via search as well as just an improved product. Steve, you mentioned this earlier about the maturation of new user cohorts and how people spend more time. Are you seeing anything different with new users more recently? And then, Jen, retail is just a massive opportunity. Can you talk about DPAs and what you guys need to do to unlock the retail advertising opportunity more acutely?\nSteve Huffman: Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Me first then Jen. Okay. So, the question was, are we seeing anything in the latest cohort of new users. Broadly, we're seeing new user retention go up. That's one of our core internal operating metrics. And I think that's really a measurement of is onboarding working, is the performance ML relevance, all of those things working and so we've actually seen over the last couple of quarters, steady improvement in news or retention, which we're very happy with. In my experience at Reddit, that is the hardest number to move because you can't always see it in an individual experiment. So, you have to kind of let these product improvements run for a while. But our strategy of just make Reddit better, simpler, faster, safer, easier to use, that's been working for the last year. So happy with the new user retention, particularly among that new cohort. Jen, the question was about the retail opportunity on Reddit.\nJen Wong: Yes, I think the question is about DPA. Look, I think this is a really big opportunity given the commercial intent on Reddit. But it's also one of the hardest, right, in the industry. Dynamic product ads, they have their -- it's its own objective, it has its own models and prediction models and it has its own end-to-end workflow from ingesting catalogs all the way to how measurement is done at a detailed level to feedback product level information for the targeting and retargeting. So, it is a big ecosystem onto itself. So, what we're working on is; one, improving our models and we're driving performance; number two, CAPI, so conversion API, incredibly important for signal and feeding signal into the models for better and better performance; third is enabling first-party data from an advertiser to match into our platform for targeting; and then, obviously, on the measurement side, they have very specific audiences, maybe loyalty programs for some cases, like retail media networks that they want to be able to target against; and then finally, just continuing to improve both the format and the catalog in jet. So, we can adjust catalogs today, but we want to make that process easier and even more scalable. So, we are working across all of these areas to continue to improve DPA. I would just say it is -- our goal for this year is to test with a handful of partners and really build the foundations of DPA so that it can be a more material contributor to the business in '25 and beyond. It is a longer road, but I think a big opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tom Champion with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nTom Champion: Steve, you've talked in the past about the most reliable way to grow is to make Reddit better. So, I'm just curious between sports content, subreddits functionality search, text translation, the laundry list of things you guys are working on. What do you think has the potential to be the most impactful from a customer experience perspective?\nSteve Huffman: Thanks, Tom. Good question. I'd say there are broadly two -- two dimensions to this or kind of two ways I think about it. So the first is like the general quality. And so this is, call it, the search experience onboarding ease of use. In mature markets like the U.S. is actually still one of our fastest-growing markets. Product quality has an outsized impact because the content is already there. If you speak English, if you live in America, I guarantee you have a home on Reddit. Your interest, your passion, whatever you're into are going through is on Reddit somewhere. And so the question is can we reveal that? And so anything we do around onboarding and relevance more effectively reveals that. And so that's driving a lot of the growth in the U.S. Now outside of the U.S., we need the content base to grow. So, machine translation is one of the best opportunities we've ever seen to rapidly grow the content base outside of English. So, I've mentioned this over the last couple of quarters, our tests in French. That went very well. We're expanding to other languages. So, I think this is a very exciting opportunity. Now of course, all of the quality and onboarding efforts that works -- that will work in every market, but you have to have the content base, the community base to recommend people too. And so that's where the machine translation is really affected. So to summarize, in the U.S., it's the block and tackle product quality work. And outside of the U.S., it's the machine translation to get them to the point where the quality can be like a multiplier effect on top of that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the Daniel Salmon from New Street Research. Please go ahead.\nDaniel Salmon: Steve, you talked a lot about search and third-party search and the relationship with model training and thus your data licensing business. You also talked about beginning to restrict access to Reddit content in some cases. we have seen news reports that, that includes Microsoft Bing. I'm sure you don't want to speak too much in detail about one potential partner. But is that an example of the type of back and forth that's beginning to transpire with some of your potential partners? Or just more broadly, can you take us a layer deeper in those conversations and tell us a little bit more about the variables that tend to be the more important ones in those dialogues.\nSteve Huffman: Sure. Thanks, Dan. So look, the corpus of content on Reddit is super valuable. The old status quo, so search engines crawl us index that's put us in search. Everybody wins in that. The consumer finds content, we get some users, the search businesses grow. Reddit in that arrow is the most open. By the way, I think Reddit is still the most open of our peers. But what's changed is folks are calling Reddit for training and other use cases that we can't see. And so, we can no longer assume intent for what Reddit's data is being used for. And so, we went from a situation of being default open to default blocking crawlers. Now we're still open for users. You don't even have to have an account to see Reddit. And we still make our corporates available for free for noncommercial use our preference is for Reddit content to be out there, to be open and indexed, but it has to come with important terms. And so -- we created a public content policy we released that a couple of months ago. And it basically speaks to user privacy, not using Reddit data to identify users or target ads to them, you can't resell the data because, again, we want to know where Reddit data is going and what it's being used for. And so those are the terms of engagement. Now we've had some big players sign up for that. We've had some medium and small players sign up for that as well. And we still make Reddit available for free for researchers and noncommercial use. But the ecosystem has changed. I'd say it's a dynamic market for sure. All of our conversations are ongoing. Look, I think, as I said many times, our preference is to have relationships with everybody, but we need to be very considered of where Reddit data goes and what it's used for.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Black: So, on the developer platform, so opening it up to monetization is coming earlier than we anticipated. So -- can you talk a little bit more about the results from the public data and what surprised you to the upside for instance? And then Drew, quickly on margins, the flow-through was, I think, 76% the last couple of quarters, the midpoint of 3Q guide implies a bit of a step down. Is there some comparative built in? Or maybe just more broadly, talk to the swing factors embedded in your EBITDA guide.\nSteve Huffman: Okay. Yes. Thanks, Ben. First question on debt platform. So the beta is going nicely. So we are in closed beta for most of this year. We're still iterating on the technology. It's one of the more complex things we've built because we're effectively running user code both on our servers and on the client side. That's in a public beta now. We've got a few hundred developers playing with it. There's some cool stuff in the works. So, I'm excited to see where users take it. Our aim for this year is to both get some of these debt platform apps kind of at scale out there. We see some fun ones of scoreboard, stock tickers and Wall Street bets, things like that. I'd love -- I'd be very excited to see some of these more interactive ones, and I'll be very, very excited to see somebody build something that we didn't anticipate, which is kind of a common story of Reddit is users surprising us. So, one milestone we're looking for is that surprise. And then the other milestone we're looking for is just to connect the dots on monetization. And so really getting an end-to-end prototype where a user can basically buy something through a developer platform app written by another user. So, I can't promise scale or anything like that this year. But getting to that kind of end-to-end proof of concept will be, I think, a really important milestone. But we're making nice progress towards that. Drew, the second question was about margin and flow-through Q3.\nDrew Vollero: Yes. Look, it's really been a good run for us last four quarters, as you mentioned, 73%, 76% last quarter. Look, there's nothing enormous going on. There's a couple of things on the margin the guide itself sort of has, I think, an incremental margin in more of the 60s range, there's a couple of things in between that are happening. I mean, I think, again, incremental revenues are our friends. The guide is a little higher than where we were in in the second quarter, 281. So, we'll pick up something there, which is nice. I think there's a couple of things to think about as you think about our margin structure. But again, just small stuff on the margin, a nice benefit that we got over the last 12 months has been contract prices on hosting. And so, we signed those contracts in kind of mid-third quarter last year. We've enjoyed kind of a full year of those benefits you remember. Our gross margins were up 500 basis points in the second quarter. We'll start to lap that contract pricing now here in the third quarter. So that will be a little bit of a -- we won't see the benefit that we have seen over the last four quarters on that. Again, a couple of other small things in the margin. The Company pays raises typically in the third quarter. So, there'll be a little bit more on the cost structure there, again, on the margin, small stuff. And then also we hire a bit more in the third quarter. Historically, we have a lot of folks that come in, the folks that we've hired from universities typically start during that time. So, it's a little bit on the margin again. So, nothing huge. Maybe a couple of points lower we'll see sort of you can do the math around kind of what the guide margin is. But overall, there's nothing significant in the quarter. There's a little bit also in the model for business translation, right? So, we're starting to translate, as Steve said, some of the markets into foreign languages, there's some hosting costs associated with that as well. So those are things, but no huge change right now in the margin structure.\nOperator: Our final question today comes from Alan Gould with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nAlan Gould: I've got two. First, what impact as Olympics and political historically had for you on users' engagement. I'm assuming not much on revenue? And the second one for Drew, is that cash guide that you were a cash goal of $800 million to $1 billion is significantly less than what you have now. I'm assuming that's a multiyear period to get to that.\nSteve Huffman: Okay. Thanks, Alan. First question, maybe Jen and I will tag team that real-quick. So, there are certainly moments in the world that are huge, right? Olympics, elections, major sporting events like the Super Bowl has been a big one on Reddit. What we've seen -- and we've seen this for a long time, is there's always some subreddit on Reddit that's having a moment, that's twice as large as they were yesterday or sometimes significantly more. But when you zoom out, our traffic doesn't fluctuate that much because there are many thousands of subreddits, and so somebody is always having a moment, somebody is always growing, but our traffic is actually pretty steady despite kind of feeling that activity on the Internet or even feeling it on Reddit. Jen, is there anything to add from a kind of revenue point of view around these events?\nJen Wong: No, we don't say in critical ad, so there's not a bump from that, not a focus for us and something like Olympics, I think tracks to see what you just said, which is there's always these moments happening on Reddit, but overall, they kind of smooth out, and that's how it reflects in the revenue. Those are opportunities -- sales opportunities, but they tend to smooth out because there's moments happening in different parts of Reddit throughout the year.\nSteve Huffman: Okay. And the final question with Drew.\nDrew Vollero: Yes. On the cash side, you're right, Alan. Thanks for the question. $800 billion is how we think about things over the medium term. We wanted to dimensionalize the cash that we have on the balance sheet right now at $1.7 billion. I gave you a sense on kind of the cash flow over the last couple of quarters, which has been positive and nice. So, the cash is starting to build. We also wanted to give you a sense on how we think about the priorities here. The first priority will be and continues to be investing in the business. There aren't huge ideas right now from a capital investment perspective. And so, we're also starting to look at M&A. You saw us tuck in Memorable in the quarter. So, there's money available for that. And then sort of we'll start to think about share repurchases as we move forward as well. So those are sort of the capital priorities. I think of $800 million to $1 billion is sort of how we look at our business from a stress test perspective. We think that's the right amount of cash. Obviously, we have a credit facility behind it, too. So, I think the Company has a lot of capitalization and certainly has the liquidity to do what it wants, but I wanted to start to dimensionalize a little bit for you how we think about what cash might be available for things like M&A and share repurchases in the future.\nJesse Rose: Great. Thanks, Krista. Thanks, everyone, for joining. We look forward to keeping the dialogue open. Take care.\nSteve Huffman: Appreciate it, folks. See you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Huffman",
            "content": "Hi, everyone. Thank you for joining, and welcome to our second quarter earnings call. Q2 was another strong quarter for Reddit in our communities. We kept up our momentum with both strong business performance and progress on the product. In Q2, both users and revenue grew over 50% year-over-year. And for the second consecutive quarter, we had positive cash flow and we're profitable on an adjusted EBITDA basis. User growth has continued to climb, reaching new heights with over 342 million active users and more than 91 million daily active users. More and more people are coming to Reddit to explore their interests, engage in conversations and find their communities. And increasingly, users are turning to Reddit for answers to their questions via search, recognizing the authenticity and trustworthiness of our content across a wide variety of topics. Our product work is focused on enhancing the user experience to make Reddit faster, safer and easier to use. Conversations are the heart of Reddit, and we've improved our app with near instant comment loading and more intuitive navigation across different post types, including text, video and images. The recent improvements bring users into conversations faster and more often, driving more engagement on the platform. The number of comments viewed reached a new high, up 10% from Q1 to Q2. Over the years, we've hosted some notable Ask Me Anything sessions, ranging from U.S. presidents to celebrities and sports figures to regular people with interesting stories. We introduced several updates to the AMA feature, making it easier for a host to schedule and post and easier for users to participate. During the pilot, we've seen hundreds of new AMAs created, including those with high-profile brands and artists. These product updates tie into our advertising strategy, allowing us to test new conversation ad placements and AMA ads, which are high-intent services for brands and businesses to reach their audience. As the platform continues to scale, so does our need for safety and moderation tools. Using AI, we are reducing the moderation burden and making Reddit's platform safer at scale. We're evolving what the day-to-day looks like for moderators on Reddit, allowing them to spend more time engaging and growing their communities. International expansion remains a top priority and one of our largest opportunities. 50% of our current user base is outside of the U.S., and we believe we can scale this meaningfully over time. International growth was a key driver in Q2, both in users and revenue. International daily active users exceeded 45 million, growing 44% year-over-year and 11% from Q1. This was led by focus countries like France, India, the U.K. and the Philippines, where we're seeing good results with our growth strategies, including through machine translation. Immersive=machine translation is now widely available in French, and as a result, France was one of our fastest growing countries surpassing growth in the U.S. We will now begin to expand machine translation to German, Spanish and Portuguese, aiming to make Reddit accessible to everyone regardless of their native language. Looking ahead, we're making progress across our emerging initiatives, including the user economy, search and data licensing. Starting with the user economy. We're excited to have our developer platform out to public beta with a few hundred active developers. In Q2, we saw growing engagement with about 3x more custom post use than in Q1, including scoreboards and stock tickers in our international sports and investing communities. We're working towards enabling monetization within the developer platform to empower our users to create and earn money on the platform this year. I look forward to sharing more about this in the coming quarters. Okay. Next, let's discuss our opportunity in search. Reddit's content is uniquely valuable and becoming more important in the context of Internet search. Users run over 1 billion search queries a month on Reddit today, and our product work is improving the search experience and success rate on the platform. Later this year, we will begin testing new search result pages powered by AI to summarize and recommend content, helping users dive deeper into product shows, games and discover new communities on Reddit. Turning to third-party search. We're seeing an evolution in the search ecosystem where Internet search, summarization and training are blending. We are seeking the right balance between openness and protecting our users and platform. Our partnerships with Google and OpenAI align with our public content policies and uphold our belief in the connected Internet, helping people find what they're looking for and to discover communities on Reddit. Our preference is for Reddit it to be open and indexed in third-party search, and we are in discussions with both big and small search engines towards this end. However, some players in ecosystem have not been transparent with their use of Reddit's content. And in those instances, we've blocked access to protect Reddit content and user privacy. We believe the Internet and search are better with Reddit's content and we remain open to finding solutions that are mutually beneficial to our users, Reddit and the broader Internet community. To wrap up, I'm happy with the progress we've made in our first two quarters as a public company. We're still early in our journey with many opportunities and opportunities for execution ahead to fulfill our mission. Thank you again for being a part of this journey with us. And now, I'll hand it over to Jen. Okay. Thanks, Jen. For the community questions, Jen, Drew and I will record answers to the rest of them and post them tomorrow. Okay. Jesse, back to you. Okay. Thanks, Doug. Second question about search. So, we're talking about on Reddit search. A lot of our work over the last couple of years has been on the back end. So improving the actual results, so the speed and relevance of those results. Some of that is on first-party technology. Some of that is third-party technology. We're also beginning to enhance the results with AI. Again, some of those are first-party models. Some of those will be third-party models. And what I was really referring to in my script is the rest of this year, we'll start to see the front-end product actually change, so the user experience and how we package these results because that's gone unchanged for a long time. Search on Reddit is a huge opportunity. Many new users run a search. You've heard me talk about onboarding, helping connect users to their interest on Reddit. For many users, they're literally typing into a box exactly what they're interested in. So it's, I think, really important consumer product service area. And then, of course, over the long term, there's significant advertising potential there as well. But really, what I'm referring to here is -- it will be our in-house efforts to improve the presentation of that product. Thank you, Laura. Great question. So yes, I think one of the truly special and honestly, almost magical things about Reddit is the amount of time and effort people spend helping each other, giving advice, helping people through decisions sometimes small decisions, which should I watch tonight, sometimes big decisions like should I go through this breakup. It's really, I think, truly profound. Your question is if we start to include other incentives in there, like monetary incentives, does that change. In my experience on Reddit, whenever we add basically a new way of using Reddit, what happens is it expands Reddit, but we've not seen it cannibalize existing Reddit. And so, I think the existing altruistic-free version of Reddit will continue to exist and grow and thrive just the way it has. But now we will unlock the door for new use cases, new types of subreddits that can be built that may have exclusive content or private areas, things of that nature. A good example of this, for example is, at Reddit, we didn't host images back in the past. It was all text and links and images were linked. So, we'd link to other websites or platforms for images. When we added image hosting, all of a sudden, there's a ton of new communities built around that feature, but the existing text and link-based Reddit also continued to grow. So, I'd look at this as an opportunity of expansion as opposed to one that is going to cannibalize the existing Reddit, which as I said, is magical. It's something that we think is truly precious. And so, we'll, of course, watch these things closely, but that's how we see it playing out. Okay. Ron, thank you for the questions. Yes, as you observed, logs in DAU is up over 30% last year. That is indeed our fastest growth rate among that segment in years. So, we're very happy with that. And you answered your own question, improved onboarding, Shred-it, which represents web performance. I would say broadly a general push around quality on Red it has helped a lot. And then there is a structural change that we've been going through over the last couple of years, which is it used to be when you're a new user to Reddit, we were putting you into basically global feed. So we call that the popular feed today. That was the core Reddit product for the first maybe 15 years of our life. And now what happens is we get you into the community onboarding experience. And so, we try to find the interest specific to you. And then we put you in a home feed that has those communities in subreddit, and we grow from there. And so that first user experience has gotten much more dialed in and relevant to new users, which has been driving meaningful improvements to new user retention and of course, that compounds and the growth. And so, the story of it I think for a long time is we've had this very big top of funnel from third-party search and word of mouth. And the question has been, can we retain those users because we get so many shots on goal every day. So really, over the last year, we've gotten much better at retaining new users, and we've been growing over 1 million users a month more or less since spring of last year. Jen, there was a second question on the stable ad market. Great. Okay. Rich, thanks. I'll take the first half. Jen will take the second half. So, look, let's -- first things first. We're happy with growth. Weekly is growing, daily is growing, logged in, logged out growing, so I think we're in a good position there. I think your observation is correct. Weeklys and of course, monthlys even more so, can be more volatile because they can be more affected by third-party search or events in the news and what have you. And of course, we want to grow dailys, and that's really how we operate the Company is growing dailys. But we don't think necessarily about how do we convert weekly to dailys. We think about it a little bit differently, which is how do we retain the dailys that we see on the platform every day. both the new users, getting them to come back at all and the core user is getting them to come back more. And our work there is -- it's hard work, but it's easy to explain. Relevancy, ML, onboarding product quality. Do you see something -- a very simple question? Do you see something in your first session on Reddit that is uniquely engaging? One assumption that I would caution against making is that search users, third-party search users, many of them are core users. So, they're using other search engines to effectively navigate Reddit, and I include myself in that cohort. But there are a number of logged out users or new potential users that come from search. And I think of that experience is there learning that Reddit, over time, has the answers to their questions. They may not be in that session looking to join a community. That's maybe a little bit of a heavier experience. But eventually, we get them through the front door. They'll come -- they'll download our app, but they'll come to the website. And then that's where everything I mentioned around relevancy and product quality come into play to retain those users. And we're growing retention and we're growing DAU. So, we're happy with that result. And then there's another interesting dynamic on Reddit, which is the longer somebody has their account, the more time they actually spend on Reddit. They join more communities and they go deeper and deeper. And so, users on Reddit where they maybe on other platforms age out, they actually age into Reddit and spend more time over the course of years. So I think this is a really powerful trend. Okay. Jen, the second half of the question was the interplay between users and ARPU and users in CPM. Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Me first then Jen. Okay. So, the question was, are we seeing anything in the latest cohort of new users. Broadly, we're seeing new user retention go up. That's one of our core internal operating metrics. And I think that's really a measurement of is onboarding working, is the performance ML relevance, all of those things working and so we've actually seen over the last couple of quarters, steady improvement in news or retention, which we're very happy with. In my experience at Reddit, that is the hardest number to move because you can't always see it in an individual experiment. So, you have to kind of let these product improvements run for a while. But our strategy of just make Reddit better, simpler, faster, safer, easier to use, that's been working for the last year. So happy with the new user retention, particularly among that new cohort. Jen, the question was about the retail opportunity on Reddit. Thanks, Tom. Good question. I'd say there are broadly two -- two dimensions to this or kind of two ways I think about it. So the first is like the general quality. And so this is, call it, the search experience onboarding ease of use. In mature markets like the U.S. is actually still one of our fastest-growing markets. Product quality has an outsized impact because the content is already there. If you speak English, if you live in America, I guarantee you have a home on Reddit. Your interest, your passion, whatever you're into are going through is on Reddit somewhere. And so the question is can we reveal that? And so anything we do around onboarding and relevance more effectively reveals that. And so that's driving a lot of the growth in the U.S. Now outside of the U.S., we need the content base to grow. So, machine translation is one of the best opportunities we've ever seen to rapidly grow the content base outside of English. So, I've mentioned this over the last couple of quarters, our tests in French. That went very well. We're expanding to other languages. So, I think this is a very exciting opportunity. Now of course, all of the quality and onboarding efforts that works -- that will work in every market, but you have to have the content base, the community base to recommend people too. And so that's where the machine translation is really affected. So to summarize, in the U.S., it's the block and tackle product quality work. And outside of the U.S., it's the machine translation to get them to the point where the quality can be like a multiplier effect on top of that. Sure. Thanks, Dan. So look, the corpus of content on Reddit is super valuable. The old status quo, so search engines crawl us index that's put us in search. Everybody wins in that. The consumer finds content, we get some users, the search businesses grow. Reddit in that arrow is the most open. By the way, I think Reddit is still the most open of our peers. But what's changed is folks are calling Reddit for training and other use cases that we can't see. And so, we can no longer assume intent for what Reddit's data is being used for. And so, we went from a situation of being default open to default blocking crawlers. Now we're still open for users. You don't even have to have an account to see Reddit. And we still make our corporates available for free for noncommercial use our preference is for Reddit content to be out there, to be open and indexed, but it has to come with important terms. And so -- we created a public content policy we released that a couple of months ago. And it basically speaks to user privacy, not using Reddit data to identify users or target ads to them, you can't resell the data because, again, we want to know where Reddit data is going and what it's being used for. And so those are the terms of engagement. Now we've had some big players sign up for that. We've had some medium and small players sign up for that as well. And we still make Reddit available for free for researchers and noncommercial use. But the ecosystem has changed. I'd say it's a dynamic market for sure. All of our conversations are ongoing. Look, I think, as I said many times, our preference is to have relationships with everybody, but we need to be very considered of where Reddit data goes and what it's used for. Okay. Yes. Thanks, Ben. First question on debt platform. So the beta is going nicely. So we are in closed beta for most of this year. We're still iterating on the technology. It's one of the more complex things we've built because we're effectively running user code both on our servers and on the client side. That's in a public beta now. We've got a few hundred developers playing with it. There's some cool stuff in the works. So, I'm excited to see where users take it. Our aim for this year is to both get some of these debt platform apps kind of at scale out there. We see some fun ones of scoreboard, stock tickers and Wall Street bets, things like that. I'd love -- I'd be very excited to see some of these more interactive ones, and I'll be very, very excited to see somebody build something that we didn't anticipate, which is kind of a common story of Reddit is users surprising us. So, one milestone we're looking for is that surprise. And then the other milestone we're looking for is just to connect the dots on monetization. And so really getting an end-to-end prototype where a user can basically buy something through a developer platform app written by another user. So, I can't promise scale or anything like that this year. But getting to that kind of end-to-end proof of concept will be, I think, a really important milestone. But we're making nice progress towards that. Drew, the second question was about margin and flow-through Q3. Okay. Thanks, Alan. First question, maybe Jen and I will tag team that real-quick. So, there are certainly moments in the world that are huge, right? Olympics, elections, major sporting events like the Super Bowl has been a big one on Reddit. What we've seen -- and we've seen this for a long time, is there's always some subreddit on Reddit that's having a moment, that's twice as large as they were yesterday or sometimes significantly more. But when you zoom out, our traffic doesn't fluctuate that much because there are many thousands of subreddits, and so somebody is always having a moment, somebody is always growing, but our traffic is actually pretty steady despite kind of feeling that activity on the Internet or even feeling it on Reddit. Jen, is there anything to add from a kind of revenue point of view around these events? Okay. And the final question with Drew. Appreciate it, folks. See you."

            "name": "Drew Vollero",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. Reddit delivered very strong second quarter results across the board, which built on the sound start in Q1 and rounded out a solid first half of the year. In the quarter, three key financial themes developed: first, our most important growth and cost metrics really shined; second, our profitability continues to inflect rapidly as our business scales; third, we saw continued traction on important economic drivers like cash flow, CapEx, dilution and stock-based compensation. Let's speak to each point starting first with strength and key metrics, specifically users, revenues, gross margins and OpEx. We saw really solid growth in the quarter with both user growth and revenue growth exceeding 50% year-over-year. The DAUq was $91.2 million, up 51%, logged out users were about 70% of the end quarter growth, but total logged-in users grew 31% year-over-year, the fastest rate in the last few years. Revenues were $281 million, up 54% as impression gains continue to fuel our growth. Ad revenue grew 41% in Q2, while other revenue grew over 690%, primarily driven by new licensing deals with Google, OpenAI and others. Margin growth also really shined in the quarter. Gross margins were nearly 90%, up from 84% in the prior year, driven by operating efficiencies, lower pricing from our cloud hosting contracts and the leverage from incremental revenues. For Q2, our 12% adjusted OpEx cost growth is very consistent with the last four quarters where adjusted OpEx growth has averaged about 9%. The Company continues to leverage the organizational scale it's built over the last few years as we targeted modest hiring in the front of house areas like AdTech, machine learning and sales. Total headcount was up less than 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. So, as you can see, terrific traction on key metrics. Second, let me touch on how profitability is inflecting rapidly as the business scales. On a GAAP basis, our net loss was $10 million, $31 million better than prior year and very solid progress against our internal goal of reaching GAAP breakeven. Q2 adjusted EBITDA was nearly $40 million, up $30 million sequentially and up $75 million year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margins reached the mid-double-digit level at 14% up from 4% in Q1 and negative 19% in the prior year. The key to our significant gains in profitability continue to be both execution and our strong economic model. Revenue grew over 5x as fast as total adjusted costs in Q2, similar to Q1 as revenues grew 54% year-over-year and total adjusted costs grew slightly less than 11% year-over-year. That's well ahead of our long-term internal goal of revenue growth twice as fast as total adjusted cost growth. Now relatedly, our incremental adjusted EBITDA margins were 76% for the quarter, slightly higher than our last four quarter average of 73%. In Q2, we saw a $75 million positive change in adjusted EBITDA on a $98 million change in revenue. Now to the third point, we're not only seeing good traction in areas like growth and costs, but also on important metrics like cash flow, CapEx, stock-based compensation and dilution. Operating cash flow was $28 million in Q2, an $82 million positive change from Q2 of 2023. For the first half of the year, positive operating cash flow was $60 million. Our CapEx remains very light, about $1 million in the second quarter, less than 1% of revenue. Stock-based compensation, including related taxes, was $67 million, down substantially from the last quarter due to the recognition of IPO-related stock expenses. Stock-based compensation was about 24% of revenue for the quarter. Share count movements were modest in Q2 as basic shares outstanding were $166 million, up 1% sequentially, but fully diluted shares were $205 million, down sequentially. On the other hand, cash was $1.7 billion, which gives us a lot of flexibility as our business scales into profitability and positive cash flow. In medium term, we believe the right amount of cash on hand for the business today is around $800 million to $1 billion. The Company will look to deploy capital where it makes sense over time with capital priorities being: first, investing in our business, M&A and share repurchases. As Jen mentioned, we recently completed and announced the acquisition of Memorable AI and ad creative optimization platform to help drive lower funnel performance for our advertisers. The preliminary purchase price consideration was $19.9 million, including $17.1 million of cash. The deal closed in late July and will be reflected in the Q3 financial statements. As we look ahead, we'll share our internal thoughts on revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter, where we have the greatest date of visibility. For the third quarter 2024, we estimate revenue in the range of $290 million to $310 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $40 million to $60 million. These estimates include the anticipated benefits from the recently signed content partnerships with the sports leagues. We anticipate these deals will contribute modestly to revenue this year, more in Q4 than Q3 and should have a greater financial impact in 2025 and beyond. So, to summarize, the strength and consistency of the numbers were nice to see throughout the first half of 2024. Both Q1 and Q2 were solid quarters for Reddit. That said, our business historically scales seasonally, and we've turned our attention and focus to the back half of 2024. Now let me turn the call over to Steve. Okay. On the guide, Doug here, we guided 290 to 310. If you take the midpoint of that year-over-year growth is mid-40s. We think that's a good number. We think that's differentiated versus the pure set. If you look over the last four quarters, we've been growing in the mid- to high 30s. So, we feel like it's a differentiated number. I take your point that your measurement stake is a bit different. You're looking just only at the second quarter. So, I take your point there. In terms of the revenue drivers that you're looking at sort of the incrementality of them. Look, I think that the sports deals are something that's probably a bigger idea for us in 2025 and beyond. We have to get that sold through our sales force, et cetera. So, I would look for a very modest impact in Q3. I think we'll have a little bit more, particularly with the NFL in the fourth quarter. That's kind of the main part of the NFL season. So, I think that incrementality in the third quarter will be pretty modest. As it relates to kind of OpenAI, we saw about half the benefit of the deal in the second quarter. So, there will be a little bit of incrementality to your point. But overall, I think the guide feels good. Are there particular things that we're looking at in the third quarter that we can put our finger on? No, there isn't anything that's particularly different than what we've seen. Now for the full year, there still is some macro uncertainty and particularly in the fourth quarter around elections. So, I think that's a little bit in the background. But I think overall in the third quarter, I think the guide feels good to where the business is right now feels better than where we've been over the last four quarters. But I do take your point, it's a little bit lower than we've been in the second quarter, but I think we take a little broader lens than that. Yes. Look, it's really been a good run for us last four quarters, as you mentioned, 73%, 76% last quarter. Look, there's nothing enormous going on. There's a couple of things on the margin the guide itself sort of has, I think, an incremental margin in more of the 60s range, there's a couple of things in between that are happening. I mean, I think, again, incremental revenues are our friends. The guide is a little higher than where we were in in the second quarter, 281. So, we'll pick up something there, which is nice. I think there's a couple of things to think about as you think about our margin structure. But again, just small stuff on the margin, a nice benefit that we got over the last 12 months has been contract prices on hosting. And so, we signed those contracts in kind of mid-third quarter last year. We've enjoyed kind of a full year of those benefits you remember. Our gross margins were up 500 basis points in the second quarter. We'll start to lap that contract pricing now here in the third quarter. So that will be a little bit of a -- we won't see the benefit that we have seen over the last four quarters on that. Again, a couple of other small things in the margin. The Company pays raises typically in the third quarter. So, there'll be a little bit more on the cost structure there, again, on the margin, small stuff. And then also we hire a bit more in the third quarter. Historically, we have a lot of folks that come in, the folks that we've hired from universities typically start during that time. So, it's a little bit on the margin again. So, nothing huge. Maybe a couple of points lower we'll see sort of you can do the math around kind of what the guide margin is. But overall, there's nothing significant in the quarter. There's a little bit also in the model for business translation, right? So, we're starting to translate, as Steve said, some of the markets into foreign languages, there's some hosting costs associated with that as well. So those are things, but no huge change right now in the margin structure. Yes. On the cash side, you're right, Alan. Thanks for the question. $800 billion is how we think about things over the medium term. We wanted to dimensionalize the cash that we have on the balance sheet right now at $1.7 billion. I gave you a sense on kind of the cash flow over the last couple of quarters, which has been positive and nice. So, the cash is starting to build. We also wanted to give you a sense on how we think about the priorities here. The first priority will be and continues to be investing in the business. There aren't huge ideas right now from a capital investment perspective. And so, we're also starting to look at M&A. You saw us tuck in Memorable in the quarter. So, there's money available for that. And then sort of we'll start to think about share repurchases as we move forward as well. So those are sort of the capital priorities. I think of $800 million to $1 billion is sort of how we look at our business from a stress test perspective. We think that's the right amount of cash. Obviously, we have a credit facility behind it, too. So, I think the Company has a lot of capitalization and certainly has the liquidity to do what it wants, but I wanted to start to dimensionalize a little bit for you how we think about what cash might be available for things like M&A and share repurchases in the future."

            "name": "Jen Wong",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for revenue. Total revenue grew 54% year-over-year to $281.2 million and accelerated from the prior quarter and the fastest year-over-year growth rate since Q1 2022. The investments we made across the business continue to pay off, and we're pleased with the results in the first half of the year. The ad business continues to scale in Q2 and accelerated from the prior quarter as we executed on our strategies and saw a stable ad market. Ad revenue grew 41% year-over-year to $253.1 million. We made progress scaling and diversifying the business, expanding partnerships and executing on our AdTech road map. Let me discuss our ad revenue drivers. We saw double-digit year-over-year growth in impressions from personalized ad loads, underlying user growth and product enhancements to drive ad efficiency against a year-over-year decline in pricing. We continue to diversify our business across channels, verticals and geographies. The global scale channel, including mid-market and SMB grew over 50% year-over-year, driven by both new advertiser activation and by deepening existing relationships. Strength in our verticals was led by retail, pharma and financial services, which each grew over 50% year-over-year. International revenue accelerated from the prior quarter and grew 49% year-over-year, driven by strength across large and mid-market customers in EMEA. And the big six agency relationships were also growth drivers in the quarter. Our Q2 growth was across the full funnel. Performance objectives drove more than half of our revenue in the quarter and we more than doubled the number of clicks again as we continue to enhance the lower funnel capabilities of our full funnel advertising business. We made measurable progress against our AdTech road map in Q2. We focused on: number one, driving performance of our ad solutions; number two, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity for our sales force; and number three, offering our advertisers Reddit unique solutions and bringing them closer to our communities. Now let me discuss each. First, driving performance of our ad solutions. We continued building out our conversion API ecosystem with a new partnership with mParticle. This adds to our partnerships with Google Tag Manager and Tealium as we execute our one-to-many approach for CAP adoption. We launched a performance ad solution, Dynamic Product Ads or DPA, to public data. Early adopters have seen about a 2x higher return on ad spend, or ROAS, compared to other conversion campaigns. Now, it's still early for this solution, and we'll continue to invest in improving performance with this new solution. And we recently announced the acquisition of Memorable AI, which helps accelerate our road map to bring AI-driven intelligence tools and ad creative to our advertisers to help drive performance. With this acquisition, we're adding AI foundational models to our ad stack to help optimize creative, and we are working towards integration beginning to have impact next year. Second, improving usability for our users and productivity for our sales force. We've launched our Reddit ads API to GA, allowing partners and advertisers to integrate with Reddit's ad manager and build customized campaigns and analytics, which help to expand our platform's reach. Sprinklr is the first marketing intelligence platform to integrate with both Reddit's ads API and data API, offering advertisers unique insights and capabilities. In Q2, we extended our partnership with DoubleVerify and announced a new partnership with IAS to provide advertisers with brand safety and suitability measurement complementing our robust first-party brand safety controls and fostering transparency and trust with the major brands. Third, offering our advertisers ready unique solutions and bringing them closer to communities. We expanded ad placements on the conversation page, a high intent and valuable surface for both our users and advertisers and where nearly 50% of all screen views occur. We launched the test of ads between comments and a new refreshed set of ad formats for conversation ads that are driving higher click-through rates and early testing. Advertisers using both in feed and conversation ads experience a lift in action intent compared to those using old in-feed ads. We also invested in bringing new content types to our users and offering businesses and advertisers new ways to reach and engage with communities. In Q2, we launched the next-generation version of our Ask Me Anything, AMA product, resulting in hundreds of new AMAs created. Businesses are hosting AMA and promoting them with ads to engage with communities and to share more about their brands and products. We also announced a partnership program, which brings sports content to Reddit's ad communities, including highlight videos, AMAs and behind the scenes material. This helps drive engagement on the platform and offers new ad format and placements for our advertisers. Sports are global interest and a category that our users are deeply passing about with over 1,000 active sports communities on Reddit, partnering with Sports League was a natural place to start. And we'll see how this program unfolds later this year and consider how we might expand to other verticals and categories in the future. Next, I'll shift to our data licensing business. Other revenue grew over 690% year-over-year to $28.1 million, primarily driven by data licensing agreements signed in the first half of the year. This market is still evolving, and we are exploring agreements of partners across the landscape who are aligned with our public content and user privacy policies and where there is commercial alignment. Through recent partnerships with Sprinklr and OpenAI make Reddit's corpus of authentic conversations available for these partners to access, while also putting guardrails in place that protect our users' privacy and bred its content. To date, our data licensing strategy has focused on marketing intelligence platforms and large-scale enterprise technology and search company, and we made good progress addressing these markets. We'll continue to explore opportunities with new verticals and potential ways to work with additional large and smaller scale emerging AI companies. Overall, this was a good first half of the year for Reddit, and we've made a lot of progress. Our focus now turns to the back half of the year as we work to continue growing the business. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew. Steve. So, what's important to growing revenue in our auction is that advertisers find the outcomes they want at the volumes and price they want. And our ads platform and marketplace is still early, still young. So, we do see opportunity to drive more demand and performance which can drive more value per ad or CPM, cost per thousand impressions. As load on Reddit, where there are ad today, like in the feed, for example, is light compared to peers. And the best we can tell outside in is about half of peer platforms. But there are still many places on Reddit without ads today. So, we're more focused on designing ads for spaces where users are spending more time versus increasing ad load in existing spaces. So, for example, 50% of screen views, they're now in conversation stages, that's an opportunity. Yes. I think we saw a stable ad market in Q2, Ron. I'd say post can, I think -- first of all, I think can have very strong sentiment post. Can was working with Shred-It, it's a very, very positive. Look, we're watching a few things. We're watching inflation, geopolitics, elections. I will say a few things. One, there are real election jitters. We did see some pauses in the U.K. around the snap election, we saw pauses around the time of the Trump rally shooting. So, I think there's a lot of caution. I will also say that recently, agencies have signaled a little bit of back half caution budgets being more flattish versus growing. So, I think there is caution from the large holdcos, and we're not a big player in political ads, which some might have a political bump, but that's not something that we play in. That's kind of how I think about the back half. So overall, I think it is -- if there's still a little bit maybe more cautious but I think we're still well positioned. Sure. Happy to. So just on your question on the brand. Brand as an objective was growing really nicely for us. And in fact, I think brand, we've seen both folks come into the auction, so fitting against brand objectives as well as using our takeover product, which is a reserve product where they can align against specific subreddits, so specifically the category takeovers, you can buy category like sports, et cetera. So, we see brand advertisers come into both of those products as well as nice adoption of some of the Reddit unique formats like AMA that have been refreshed in the free format. So, brand has actually been solid as an objective, and there is really diversified spend across brand and performance. In terms of the underlying pieces of our business, I think it's really healthy in a number of ways. So, number one is we've been growing the number of active advertisers, particularly in the managed segment that has for large customers in mid-market and managed SMB. And those are really seeds for the future because you start small and you can grow those advertisers in some more products and more objectives. So that, I think, allows us to plant seeds for the future. The second is we had a number of growth drivers across our business. The scale part, mid-market and SMB growing over 50%, international becoming a growth driver, 49% year-over-year, vertical diversification. So, it used to be that our tech group was our number one vertical group. This quarter, it actually was the group that included retail, pharma, financial services, CPG, so really interesting. That diversification continues in our booking, it's actually changing the face of our book, I think, which has been really positive. And so -- and then the final thing I'll say is we've been investing in the lower funnel and specifically converging and that has accelerated in growth as an objective in our auction. So that's really nice to see because as that objective delivers more performance, that allows an unlock for more advertisers, particularly in the scale channel. So, I think the business is really healthy. We're doing a good job retaining at high rates or managed advertisers as well as adding new advertisers to the book because of the new platform capabilities. Sure. So, one of the layers in our ad stack that we want to develop and that was on our road map is around creative, both insights and optimization and then creative generation. we know that, that can be really valuable for driving performance and also just making an easier, more automated, scalable experience for advertisers. It is something that we had on our road map that we could build, but acquiring Memorable, which is one of the leaders in the market, I mean, all of our deals just showed how much customers value their technology and insight it just accelerates our ability to come -- to add this part of the ad stack. So, we're integrating -- we get technology and talent with the acquisition, and we're doing that integration work in the back half of this year to start having impact next year, but it will really accelerate our ability to deliver performance at the lower end of the funnel, in particular. I mean it will help all the performance, but particularly at the lower end of the lower funnel where ad formats and creative can have a lot of impact on quicker rates and conversions. Sure. So, Richard, look, nobody manages in the Company of two. We managed revenue growth, we managed the DAU growth and we're in the, I think, fortunate position of having really strong revenue and user growth with users being a little bit more, and that's why ARPU is down. But I think when I look at the headroom that we have, I think we've been growing share in the top row around the revenue side and I think continue to have headroom on ARPU. So, I think it may be a first-class problem that we have in the map. On the CPM side, what's really driving the decline in CPMs is the placement on the conversation page. So that's a newer unit that -- and then -- and so the -- right now, we're still building demand for that unit. And there are a couple of things we're doing to do that. So one is educating the market about that unit. It's very unique. It's very different than anything else in the market. In fact, most people don't -- most platforms don't have an add-in comment, partially because the comments aren't the best part of their platform. They are the best part of Reddit, but there's some reeducation to be done. The second is that we've actually refreshed that format so that it has a broader set of creative capability. One of the things that our advertisers wanted is just a little more functionality in that format. So, we've recently released that, and they'll be able to take advantage of it. I think that can increase demand. And then finally, we're testing ad inside the comments. So that adds some more inventory to that page that there's very low demand for it because it's been testing. It's very new. It's just experimental. So obviously, that wouldn't have high CPMs in that unit yet. So when you look at the page, but I think I mentioned earlier that 50% of screen views are now on the conversation page. So the traffic is really going to that page, which is a great high intent, highly contextual page, but we have to match the demand through the flow of the ad impressions on that page. So we'll continue to grow the demand on this new unit. I think it's a really good unit high performing, but it will take time for the demand to catch up with the supply that's been generated. That's why you see the differential in CPMs. Yes, I think the question is about DPA. Look, I think this is a really big opportunity given the commercial intent on Reddit. But it's also one of the hardest, right, in the industry. Dynamic product ads, they have their -- it's its own objective, it has its own models and prediction models and it has its own end-to-end workflow from ingesting catalogs all the way to how measurement is done at a detailed level to feedback product level information for the targeting and retargeting. So, it is a big ecosystem onto itself. So, what we're working on is; one, improving our models and we're driving performance; number two, CAPI, so conversion API, incredibly important for signal and feeding signal into the models for better and better performance; third is enabling first-party data from an advertiser to match into our platform for targeting; and then, obviously, on the measurement side, they have very specific audiences, maybe loyalty programs for some cases, like retail media networks that they want to be able to target against; and then finally, just continuing to improve both the format and the catalog in jet. So, we can adjust catalogs today, but we want to make that process easier and even more scalable. So, we are working across all of these areas to continue to improve DPA. I would just say it is -- our goal for this year is to test with a handful of partners and really build the foundations of DPA so that it can be a more material contributor to the business in '25 and beyond. It is a longer road, but I think a big opportunity. No, we don't say in critical ad, so there's not a bump from that, not a focus for us and something like Olympics, I think tracks to see what you just said, which is there's always these moments happening on Reddit, but overall, they kind of smooth out, and that's how it reflects in the revenue. Those are opportunities -- sales opportunities, but they tend to smooth out because there's moments happening in different parts of Reddit throughout the year."

I would now like to turn the call over to Jesse Rose, Head of Investor Relations. You may now begin.\nJesse Rose: Great. Thanks, Julian. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Reddit's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to share our results are Steve Huffman, Reddit's Co-Founder and CEO; Jen Wong, Reddit's COO; and Drew Vollero, Reddit's CFO. Their remarks will be followed by a Q&A session. We issued our first quarter letter to shareholders earlier today and is needed available on our Investor Relations website and our Investor Relations subreddit r/RDDT. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements, including those regarding our future plans, objectives, expected performance and in particular, our guidance for the next quarter. Actual results may vary materially from today's statements. Information concerning risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause these results to differ is included in our SEC filings, including those stated in the Risk Factors section of our filings with the SEC. These forward-looking statements represent our outlook only as of the date of this call. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements.

Now I'll turn the call over to Steve.\nSteve Huffman: Thanks, Jesse. Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Reddit's Co-Founder and CEO, and I'll be kicking things off for us today. Welcome to our first earnings call as a public company. I'd like to start off by saying thank you for spending a bit of your time with us today. We believe that great companies are built in the public markets, and we're proud to have made the transition this quarter. Our IPO was an important moment for the company. And I want to say thank you to our employees, our users and investors who all made it possible. And I also want to say welcome to our new investors, particularly to our new user investors for users to be able to own some of Reddit has long been dream of mine. Starting today and going forward, we want to include the community in this process. Our current plan will be to answer a few of the questions on this call, and then we'll do a few more on RDDT subreddit after this call. This process will likely evolve as we go forward. I also want to acknowledge the research analysts who have been with us on this journey, helping us to prepare by not doing just one but eight practice earnings calls over the last two years. Very much appreciated. Thank you. We're happy with our progress this quarter. More people are visiting Reddit than ever before. Users grew 37% year-over-year in the first quarter. We averaged over 80 million users daily and 300 million users weekly, and we grew across logged in, logged out and within the US and abroad. The most reliable way for us to grow Reddit is to make Reddit better. As such, our primary focus this year is to continue to make Reddit faster, easier to use and safer. Our new web platform, Shreddit is up to 100% of users, and it's more than twice as fast as the platform that replaces, feed equals retention, retention equals growth. We also recently updated our native apps with instant comment loading, comments and conversation at the heart of Reddit and we made it faster and easier for users to join in. Our investments in machine learning and AI will continue to improve relevance, engagement and moderation. We have and will continue to use machine learning to improve our ability to help users find communities they'll love, which in turn increases engagement across the platform. And for moderation, we've trained our own large language models that have dramatically reduced the time required for communities to enforce their own rules. We're in testing with this in a couple of communities right now, and we'll be rolling out more broadly soon. And to grow outside the US, we're using machine translation to unlock our mostly English corpus. We believe this will not only drive growth in the near-term, but also over time, will allow users from all over the world to connect regardless of the languages they speak. Now turning to some of our emerging areas as we think about the next generation of Reddit. A few of the initiatives we have here are the user economy, developer platform and search. The user economy refers to a family of features that will allow users to spend and earn money on Reddit. Launching soon is a revamped version of user awards and Reddit Gold, which is our virtual currency that enables both of these things. And our developer platform, third party developers will be able to push the boundaries of what subreddit can be, and we're excited with the early progress here. For example, wallstreetbets has livestock tickers for training stocks and a number of sports subreddit have built live scoreboards to track gain. Historically, the value of Reddit for users has been in conversation about recent topics, but with improvements to on-platform search, we can unlock the huge amount of latent value in past content, including all the answers, reviews, and advice that we have, and we're going to continue to invest here. It's an exciting time. The technology landscape is evolving and Reddit is becoming more important and valuable. Reddit is one of the largest places for authentic connection and conversation online, and more and more people are discovering and appreciating this. We believe Reddit is more important now than ever before, not only as an alternative to traditional social media, but as we enter the AI era where the value of our corpus continues to grow. The paradox I see is that as more content on the Internet is written by machines, there's an increasing premium on content that comes from real people. And we have nearly two decades of authentic conversation, unique perspectives, earnest advice, honest reviews and answers the questions about every topic imaginable. There are multiple ways, Reddit benefits from the evolving ecosystem, and we're still in the early stages of exploring use cases for Reddit data. This includes both internally to improve the platform and experience for users and externally through partnerships. We remain committed to the open Internet, but we need to be considered of where Redistata ends up and what it's used for. And we need to find the right balance between open and fair and respectful of our users. To wrap up, this was a strong start of the year for Reddit and we're executing better than ever. We see so much opportunity and could not be more excited about our future. Thanks again for taking time with us today. And now, I'll hand it over to Jen.\nJen Wong: Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Our IPO was an important milestone for Reddit in our communities, and I'm thankful for everyone that helped make it possible. I couldn't be more excited about what its future as a public company. Reddit is still early in its monetization journey, I'm proud of what we have achieved to-date with our advertising business and our new and emerging businesses in data licensing and user economy. We aspire to be a leader in contextual and inter-space advertising. And every day, we are working to improve our advertiser solutions and bring new advertisers to the platform. In the first quarter, we successfully scaled and diversified our business, expanded partnerships, and executed on our ads platform roadmap. Total revenue growth accelerated in the first quarter and grew by 48% year-over-year to $243 million, the fastest year-over-year growth since Q1 2022. We continue to see traction with our strategies alongside a more favorable ad market versus last year and made progress in our emerging data licensing business. Total U.S. revenue grew 53% and international revenue grew 30% year-over-year. International revenue represented 18% of total revenue in Q1. Advertising revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $223 million, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth year-over-year. Other revenue grew over 450% year-over-year to $20 million, primarily driven by new data licensing agreements we signed in the first quarter. I'll first discuss our ad revenue drivers. Our investments enabled us to drive performance for advertisers. Click volume doubled and we improved click-through rates by over 40% year-over-year in the quarter. Our full suite of solutions across the marketing funnel continue to position us well for a broad set of advertisers. Our performance advertising business, which drives traffic and conversions, drove more than half of our growth in the quarter. Ad revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in impressions delivered against a year-over-year decline in pricing. We saw revenue growth across all of our managed channels. Our scale business, mid-market, and SMB grew at a faster pace than total revenue. This is an investment area for us and was in line with our expectations. Our large customer service channel, which accounted for slightly over 60% of total revenue saw broad-based growth. Looking at verticals, the tech vertical returned to growth and we experienced particular strength in the finance, pharma, and CPG categories, each growing over 50% year-over-year. I'm pleased with our progress to diversify our revenue. And in Q1, there is no vertical that exceeds 20% of our ad revenue today. In terms of geography, international revenue increased 30% year-over-year to $43 billion in the first quarter, an acceleration from 21% year-over-year growth in Q4 last year. This was driven by strength across large and mid-market customers in EMEA. We've also made meaningful progress against our ad tech roadmap. Here, we've our focus on a few key pillars; number one, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity of our sales force; number two, driving full funnel performance of our ad solutions; and number three, offering our advertisers Reddit unique solutions and creative that they can't find anywhere else. So, first, to improve usability for advertisers, we focus on cutting down the campaign setup time for self-serve and small businesses. We're using advancements in AI to remove friction and reduce set of time. We launched an AI-driven headline generator for Simple Create, which is namely the self-serve creation flow for small businesses, and we're seeing promising early activation and adoption rates. Next, to improve performance and measurability of our ad solutions, we made progress building out our conversion API ecosystem to capture more signals and improve our models that drive performance. We launched our [indiscernible] late last year and this quarter, we announced integrations with [indiscernible], a leading customer data platform and Google Tag Manager. We continue to innovate with our ad products to bring our advertisers closer to our communities. We launched free-formats, which provides advertisers with a versatile and creative format to drive deeper engagement with users. Testing has shown that free-formats have a meaningfully higher click-through rate than other ad types, and we've seen double the number of campaigns per day since its launch. We also launched Reddit Pro, a free suite of AI-powered insights and tools to provide businesses an opportunity to establish and grow a meaningful organic presence on Reddit. We're currently in beta with over 1,000 businesses, including Taco Bell, Wendy's, NFL, the Wall Street Journal as well as several SMBs. We're also continuing to lay the foundation for the future of shopping on Reddit. Users come to Reddit during their purchasing journey and value the rich human-powered product and review discussions on our platform. We launched our first shopping ads and catalog ingest capabilities last year and are now testing dynamic product ads. We're pleased with the early results. Next, I'll share an update on our data licensing business. Our data licensing business continues to grow and evolve as the market is still nascent. In the first quarter, we signed licensing agreements with various companies in the social listening space and with Google as we previously announced. The financial impact of the signed partnerships are reflected in our Q1 financials as other revenue and in our revenue guide for Q2, which you'll hear from Drew shortly. Over time, we will strategically explore data licensing partnerships, as well as other uses for Reddit data internally, which we believe is also valuable in improving the platform and experience for our users and customers. Overall, we delivered solid results in our first quarter as a public company and remain focused on executing and fulfilling our mission. I hope you share the same excitement that we have in Reddit's future and look forward to the journey ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew.\nDrew Vollero: Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. As we often say, Reddit has a powerful financial model that's straightforward, advantaged and scalable. The power of the financial model was evident in the first quarter, we reached an important inflection point. In the first quarter, we were adjusted EBITDA profitable, which is both a marked difference from a year ago and a positive start to 2024. The key to that success was that revenue grew over 5x as fast as total adjusted costs. In the quarter, revenues grew 48% year-over-year and total adjusted costs grew 9% year-over-year. Let's summarize the highlights. AUQ averaged $82.7 million, up 37% year-over-year, driven by structural product changes that have increased speed, onboarding, simplicity and consumer connection to more relevant content. Domestic users were 50% of total users in the quarter, logged-in users were about 48% of the user base. Sequentially, we added 9.6 million users in the quarter, our largest increase in 3 years, with 60% -- with over 60% of those users being logged out. Revenues were $243 million, up 48% year-over-year, driven by both a strong acceleration in the ad business and the incremental data licensing revenue from new large and small deals. Other revenue was $20 million in the quarter, up 454% from last year. International revenues were $43 million, up 30% year-over-year and 18% of total revenue. Reddit's business model has a couple of distinct advantages, which really shined in the quarter in 2 areas. First, our gross margins remain best-in-class. Gross margins were 88.6% in the first quarter, up 500 basis points versus last year, driven by high-margin revenue gains, lower hosting contract prices, tax dep efficiencies and the accretive margin tailwind for the new data licensing deals. Second, our CapEx remains very light. CapEx was about $3 million in the first quarter and just over 1% of revenue. Low CapEx was a contributing factor to our positive free cash flow that was $29 million in the quarter. As we scaled our business, we saw great operating leverage in two areas: first was leverage in operating expenses and headcount. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10% year-over-year, as we continue to hire selectively in strategic areas, such as sales, ad tech and machine learning. Total Q1 ending headcount increased 2% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Second was operating leverage on incremental sales. In Q1, revenue increased approximately $79 million year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA increased about $60 million year-over-year, implying that over $0.75 on the incremental sales dollar reached the bottom line in the first quarter. These highly profitable incremental revenue dollars really helped drive positive free cash flow and swim our business into profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis. That said, we did have a GAAP net loss of $575 million in Q1, driven by stock-based compensation related taxes from the IPO. Stock-based compensation, including related taxes for the quarter was $595 million, up from $13 million a year ago, driven primarily by one-time expenses related to the vesting of restricted stock units in connection with our initial public offering. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $10 million in the first quarter, nearly a $60 million improvement from the first quarter of the prior year. This marks our first profitable Q1 on an adjusted EBITDA basis, which in digital advertising is traditionally the slowest quarter of the year Positive adjusted EBITDA was a strong driver of cash flow for the quarter. Cash from operating activities was $32 million in the first quarter, driven by improved performance and working capital improvements in DSO and DPO. A couple of other financial notes of interest on cash and shares. At the end of the first quarter, cash and marketable securities ended at $1.67 billion and includes all IPO proceeds at this point, dilution from employee grants was about 0.6% of our fully diluted shares outstanding, as we issued about 1.2 million shares to employees in Q1. We view stock as a cost of our business and plan to manage dilution to be in line with peers in a low single-digit percentage range over time. As we look ahead, we'll share our internal thoughts on revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter, which is where we have the greatest visibility. In the second quarter of 2024, we estimate revenue to be in the range of $240 million to $255 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $0 million to $15 million. So in summary, Q1 was a strong start to the year, with accelerated user and revenue growth and modest cost growth, which fueled solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow. Now let me turn the call back over to Steve.\nSteve Huffman: Thanks, Drew. Thanks, Jen. Okay. We're going to take a couple of questions from the community quickly, and then we'll turn it over to the call here. The first question from the community, how are your initiatives going in terms of licensing data for AI data models, plans to expand beyond Google? The short answer is yes. But we're being considered and selective with our partners, especially for the larger scale search and training deals. We need to be very considerate of where our data goes and what it's being used for. I can't comment on deals that are under negotiation, but the landscape is bifurcated. There are a handful of large players and then there are many more smaller opportunities, and we're looking in above. That said, not all plays an ecosystem. I think are good fits for Reddit. We're in early days here. I'd say, big picture, we have seen an increase in interest in Reddit/stata for various uses. And so we'll see -- look forward to how this grows looking forward.\nJesse Rose: Okay. Second question, Jen, I think this one for you. Can you go into specifics about what types of advertising are most responsible for the strong increase in earnings? Is that mostly increased sales on previously existing types of advertising or new types of advertising on the platform?\nJen Wong: Sure. Thanks for the question. We actually saw growth in both supply and demand. Let me talk about the demand side. So across the funnel, we saw -- we saw growth across the funnel sort of the Brand upper funnel, mid-funnel which is traffic driving as well as the bottom of the funnel, which is driving conversion. Brand, in particular, had a nice quarter and showed strength, certainly relative to -- I think Q1 2022 was the last really strong Brand quarter. So it was really nice to see Brand come back. And mid is doing really well because we have made those improvements in CTR, 40% year-over-year, doubling click volumes, a lot of efficiency for advertisers. We also saw broad-based strength across the managed channels, particularly in mid-market and our large customer channel in North America and Continental Europe. And then we have strength in verticals like finance, pharma, CPG and tech return to growth. On the supply side, while designing new ad placement is an opportunity. These -- our inventory today really consists of two core ad types. It's the ad in the feed and the ad in the conversations with the comment page. We did see strong growth in conversation placement inventory from users spending more time reading comments and diving deeper, as well as from some ad platform work. So both supply and demand were helpful in drivers in our business.\nJesse Rose: Great. Thanks, Jen. Julian, why don't we open up the line, take some questions from folks online.\nOperator: Certainly [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ron Josey from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Ron Josey: Great. Thanks for the question. Steve, Jen, Drew, great quarter. I wanted to ask, Steve, on global DAQ growing by $9.6 million sequentially. Just talk about the drivers here and the sustainability. Steve I know you mentioned SHRED-It's now fully rolled out, improved search is doing better and the home feed ML. But any insights on the sustainability of just user growth would be helpful. And then Jen and Drew, I think the comment was the ad market is healthy, but I would love to hear your thoughts as we get into the back half of the year, certainly tougher comps as well. Thank you.\nSteve Huffman: Sure, sure. Thanks. So user growth, we're happy with the results. The main driver of growth is the product is better. And so yes, we mentioned D Steve Huffman Shred- It performance, both equals retention for users. Web performance also has been driving an increase in traffic from Google, which is driving the increase largely in the logged-out users. But logged-in users, which is the core of our business, the bedrock of our inventory is also up 27% year-over-year. And the growth there is really driven by improvements to product quality. So the sign-up has gotten much more efficient, onboarding has gotten better than home feed relevance for users, finding content that's relevant to them in their first session on Reddit. We've gotten much more effective at that. We feel confident looking forward because the growth that we've seen isn't a -- it's not like a onetime spike. We've been adding users very consistently for the last year, roughly two million users a month, seven of the last 10 months, and one million users in eight of the 10 last month. And so long story short, our work is working of focusing on product performance and quality, and that's driving retention. And so the other thing we're looking forward to as we go forward is international growth. We're still 50/50 US versus non-US but our peers are more 80% to 90% non-US. And so I think there's a huge opportunity there. I think one of the big unlocks for us in the near to medium-term is machine translation. So we're translating our entire corpus that's today mostly in English and the other languages and hope that, that will help accelerate international growth. Jen, Drew, do you want to comment on the second half of the year outlook?\nJen Wong: Yeah, I'll kick it off and then pass to Drew. Look, market is healthy brand advertising, its strong as it's been since 2022. We're feeling good in many parts of our business are working well in Q1 in the first half and are well-positioned for the second half. So our strategies are gaining traction. Adds, I like the vertical diversification. We like the accelerated growth in the mid-market channel and both in North America and in coming in Europe. So a lot of positive traction. The reality is Q1 had an easier comp, the 12% year-over-year growth from Q1, 2023. We did a low visibility into the second half. And 80% of our revenue is in the US and there is a US election, which could impact our advertisers like campaigns, especially brand advertisers. And there's also inflation, geopolitical context and some type of comps in Q3, Q4. But we feel like we've had a really solid start for strategy gaining traction. We feel good, but we just have a low visibility back end of the year. Let me pass to Drew to add some more color.\nDrew Vollero: Yeah. No, I think that's well said, Jen. I think that it was a good quarter for us, Ron start to finish. Even March was very strong. I think as Jen mentioned, the comps in the first quarter are a little lower than the back half of the year, they\u2019re in the 20s. We also may have picked up some momentum from the IPO, hard to say to identify that. But we did, as I said, see strength in March. Look on the cost side of things, I think we found a good rhythm right now. I think in the last four quarters, total adjusted costs have been up 5% to 15%, average 9%. I think we're really at a place where we have good scale as a company, and we're adding resources where it makes sense. I talked about adding resources in our machine learning teams in our sales teams. I think we're in a place where we have scale, and we're adding selectively. As you know, headcount is by far and away, the biggest part of our cost driver. OpEx is 85% of total costs here, total adjusted costs here at the company. So I think we feel good at least for the next couple of quarters on how we're thinking about things, but we'll see how it plays out and I echo Jen's sentiments on kind of the headwinds and tailwinds on the back half of the year and the things that we're watching.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDoug Anmuth: Thanks for taking the questions. I have two, one for Steve, one for Drew. Steve, you highlighted the large opportunity in on-platform search. Can you just talk about what excites you here for both users and with advertisers? And then Drew, if you could just follow up on those comments a little bit more on the investment philosophy this year. You pulled back a lot in 2023, but we're obviously seeing big incrementals in 1Q. How do we think about that 5X spread between revenue growth and cost growth as you go through the course of the year and beyond? Thank you.\nSteve Huffman: Sure, thanks. So first question is on on-platform search. So like a ton of our users run searches in their first session on Reddit. And so when I talk about one of the biggest challenges and opportunities we face being helping users find their home on Reddit, many of them are typing into a box exactly what they're interested in. And so I think just from a user experience point of view, on-platform search on Reddit being great is a huge opportunity. Now today we do over a billion queries per month on Reddit, but I think there's an opportunity for quite a bit more. So we've been investing in our search back end, some quality of life features like fail track and autocomplete are coming online as we speak. We've got some, I think, very sensible and overdue improvements to the user interface coming up this year as well. And then as the search product itself gets better, of course, then there's an opportunity to monetize those pages. So there are no ads today on search result pages. But that's obviously a very high-performing product elsewhere on the Internet. And I think there's no reason to believe that it wouldn't be for Reddit as well because the intention is so explicit when users are searching. So first step, improve the product for users. And then I think when we feel like we have a good foundation there, we'll start looking at monetization. Drew, I think the next question was investment philosophy?\nDrew Vollero: Yeah, investment philosophy. Doug, thanks for the question. Look, in terms of the investment philosophy, it didn't change here. Your point about revenue five times as fast as cost, yes, nice to see for sure. It really was about the revenue line or the numerator expanding. Last three quarters, we've averaged about 23% revenue growth. This quarter, 48. If I look at our total adjusted cost growth, last four quarters has been 9%. This quarter was 9%. So the investments in the business stayed the same or consistent with the four-quarter average. What really happened here is we were able to leverage those resources and really drive a top line that was meaningfully different, double the growth rate over the last three quarters. So I think that's really what happened in terms of that. I will tell you that's an output metric. We didn't sort of design the quarter to be that way. I think internally, long-term, Doug, we'd like our revenue growth rate to be twice as fast as our cost growth. Like, that's how we think about running this business over the long-term. But there are certainly quarters where we can do better than that, and I think the first quarter was a prime example of that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBrian Nowak: Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one is on the strong user growth. Is there any way you can sort of help us unpack a little bit the benefit of the new Google partnership? Maybe any quantification of the incremental traffic, what you saw in traffic trends coming out of that from Google? And then I guess to follow-up on that, where are you on sort of the Google SGE integration? Should we think of it as a sort of a more queries you're going to be integrated in over the course of the year to make this tailwind grow? Or sort of how does that relationship work?\nSteve Huffman : Sure, Brian, it's Steve. So look, the biggest factor driving user growth is the performance and product quality, because that's what's driving retention. And so retention compounds into growth over time. Yes, we're seeing a tailwind from Google, and you can see that in our logged out numbers. But that's not the agreement we have with Google around the data training that has nothing to do with traffic. I think really the most -- the biggest driver of uptick in traffic from Google is also performance. Google bot like speed, it keeps track of the performance of the pages at crawls. And we made those pages in some cases, more than twice as fast, in some cases, up to five times as fast. And so that has a huge improvement in ranking. We do see algorithm changes from Google. Usually, you can expect maybe two a year. But sometimes they help sometimes they hurt. So you'll never hear us celebrating or complaining about those. But you can see the consistency in our growth for the last year, but over $1 million a month, basically for the last year. And so that -- I think that's been really strong and consistent and speaks to the foundational improvements. And then I think there's a secular trend that benefits at it, which is in the AI era, people value authentic content more, right, content written by humans, and that's what Reddit is, and that's what Reddit has. And so I think there's a thirst for authentic opinions and advice and commentary and just conversations. And so I think that's the kind of irony of the technology shift that we're going through is it's the value of humans and fresh ideas continues to grow. Now in terms of the Google experiences, how their product impacts Reddit, that's one of the things we're considered if when we do any sort of deal, which is like how do you display Reddit data making sure that folks linked to us and that sort of thing. And so look, I feel pretty confident in how this will play out. Like we've been a beneficiary of Reddit being in search and in Google for a long time. And so I think Reddit being well indexed is good for our respective companies, but most importantly, it's good for the end user who gets to find the answers to their questions. It brings new users to Reddit, it helps them find their home on Reddit. And so I think Google is getting better and better at displaying our content can only help. And we've seen that play out for over a decade now.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Justin Post from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJustin Post : Great. I'd like to ask one more about users and then just guidance philosophy. Certainly, a good user quarter. Just wondering about retention and churn are you seeing more people come at the top of the funnel, and that's driving it? I'm talking about Logged-in, of course. Or are you just seeing less churn? Or are people coming in more frequently, so weeklies are coming in daily or is it everything? But maybe a little more color on that. And then, Drew, maybe on the guidance since this is your first quarter just tell us a little bit more about your guidance philosophy. Sequential is maybe a little less than last year. Maybe it was a really tough comp. But just tell us how you think about guidance that you want to provide each quarter. Thank you.\nSteve Huffman: Sure. So on users, the credit has long had a massive top of funnel. We've been reporting more than 500 million monthly users for quite some time. Now we only update that user -- that number periodically, because we really run the business on dailies and weeklies. And so -- but the way we think about it is we need to improve user retention. And we're pretty confident that, just to every user on the Internet is going to bounce off read periodically, whether it's through search or a word of mouth or this or that. The challenge to us is can we retain those users. And so that's why our focus has been on quality, performance onboarding. And so we've seen really nice improvement to new user retention and user reselections and so bringing old users back. And so those are the input metrics that we really look at when we're building new products and those compounds and the growth. So that's why I keep saying, I think what we've done has made improvements to the foundation. And we get to mine those improvements for some time as opposed to this is maybe a one-time shift or things. We had a good quarter. The product is simply better, and we're benefiting from that now. Okay. Second question, I think, Drew, was on guidance.\nDrew Vollero: Right. Justin, high-level, we will guide on a quarterly basis, one quarter ahead, we'll do revenues. And we'll do adjusted EBITDA. That's what we're comfortable with at this time. In terms of the second quarter guide, I take your point we grew 48% in the first quarter. The midpoint of the guide is mid-30s. So there is a little bit of a -- de-cell there. Look, I think as we mentioned, it was a strong quarter for us, top to bottom. The month of March was very good for us, as I mentioned. I think we're just looking at the comps a little bit. I think that's a little bit, driving where we are at this point. The comp was, as Jen mentioned, 12% in the first quarter, the comp is 23. I do think we might have gotten a little bit of tailwind from the IPO in the first quarter. We'll see if those tailwinds continue. A couple of other things that kind of works in our favor in the first quarter, right, you get an extra day with Leap Day. The Easter was a little bit earlier, like all the things kind of worked a little bit. But overall, as Jen said, it's a good solid start to the year for us, and we'll sort of see how we do. I think bigger picture, we're keeping our eye on a couple of things, particularly geopolitics, I think that is the one thing that can affect you intra-quarter depending on sort of what the geopolitical situation is, brand advertisers can pull advertising if things aren't where they want it to be from time-to-time. So those are -- that's probably the biggest one. We're looking at inflation and elections to those are the other couple of things that we take a look at. But overall, it was a good quarter, first quarter, and we ended with momentum. We'll see how the second quarter plays out, but it really is kind of comp driven and sort of a couple of tailwinds that we have in the first quarter, we'll see if they continue the second.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nQ \u2013 Eric Sheridan: Thank you so much. Maybe if I could just a two-parter for Jen, Jen, when you're out talking to advertisers and thinking about the future of the platform, number one, which platform initiatives and product initiatives are resonating the most in terms of driving either advertiser count or advertising spend as we get deeper into the 2024 budget cycle. And as you go out and have those conversations, what is still the big ask or friction points you and the team are trying to solve forward to bring more advertiser count and budgeting beyond 2024 and your long-term road map? Thank you.\nJen Wong: Thanks for the question. Yes, I'd say\u2013 I think our aspiration to be a leader in contextual interstates advertising is very differentiated, and it resonates with all of our advertising partners. And the idea that Reddit can be a full-funnel solution, I think it is very attractive, and we've made good progress against that. And we started at the top of the funnel with brand. I think we have really done a lot of work and delivered a lot of performance and efficiency at the mid part of the funnel with the continuing growth in click-through rates and click volume. And now with launches like Dynamic Product Ads and you had the catalog in jest last year and the work we're doing in [indiscernible] conversions at the bottom end of the funnel, I think the advertisers see how serious we are in delivering value at the bottom end of the funnel. So this idea of being full funnel and being differentiated in terms of our targeting capabilities, I think, is really resonating. We are focused on laying down signals for the bottom end of the funnel. So you see the work we did with a group of ad manager partnership and Helium. We'll look at more of those. So cap being conversion is going incredibly important \u2013 signals into the models that we're building at the bottom end of the funnel. And just working with advertisers to start testing spend against these solutions and continue to iterate. So I think there's real excitement about, wow, you're doing great in brand and mid-funnel and now the lower end of the funnel is potentially going to open up for us to go truly full funnel. That's really, really exciting. So that's where our advertisers are, I think, particularly excited about to just have an additional objective.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Black from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nBenjamin Black: Great. Thank you for the question, Steve. I know you're pretty excited about the development program and how that could be transformative longer-term. But more near-term, what are some of the investments that is necessary to build that out even faster? And could the sort of developer platform has potential positive implications for the ad business of the growth? And then the second one, I'm not sure if this is for Drew, or obviously, a big quarter of logged out user growth. But just given the fact that logged in users monetized at a slightly higher rate. Can you just sort of help us understand what the strategy is to convert more of the logged-out users to log in...\nSteve Huffman: Thanks for the questions, Ben. So first, developer platform, yes, I am very excited about it. But I would actually frame the developer platform as a relative near-term opportunity. We've got a couple of hundred developers playing with it now, some of their work is in production as we speak, so some of the kind of scoreboards and stock tickers and things like that. But we can see in development, another level of interactivity. Our goal is to get this fully open. So all of the developers off our waitlist and there's thousands really like tell it this summer. And then started getting the monetization features in there later this year. And so I think there's a lot of opportunity there, all hands on deck trying to bring this to market. So I think the developer platform and the new Red gold in the user economy, kind of, dovetail together really nicely later this year. In terms of the dynamic between Logged-out and Logged-in, yes, the bedrock of our business today is Logged-in users. And we see plenty of Logged-out users, particularly from Google. But I don't think from a product point of view, the best strategy for us is to try to convert a Logged-out user into a Logged-in user in any particular session. They're usually coming from search, they have a question and we need to give what they're looking for as an answer, and we want to give them that answer. Now I would look at the total DAU as the \u2013 look I think of that as like opportunity down the road. Those are users. Those are human beings that are on the Reddit platform for various reasons. We just know that in any particular session, not everybody is looking to join a community and have a profound experience. Sometimes I just want an answer to the question, and that's okay. The other thing I think that's really important is that we grow our ability to monetize Logged-out users. Most of them are landing on what we call a post detail page or a comment page. So it's a very specific page. In many cases, it's talking about a specific product. Now there isn\u2019t admin on that page, but I'd say we're still in early days there, getting advertiser density so that we can have a well-targeted ad on all of those pages. And so I think there's lots of potential in monetizing Logged-out users. So in summary, I'd look at it, the Logged-out users today represent potential for future Logged-in users. They also represent potential and monetization in their own right as well. But from a product point of view, we focus on the Logged-out users having a great experience to what they're trying to do, and when a user hits us opening the app for the first time or coming to our front page, really focusing on giving them a great experience to maximize their retention.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tom Champion from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nTom Champion: Hi. Good afternoon. Steve, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the machine translation tools that you're building and maybe with an eye towards the overseas market. I think the release talks a little bit about French or the French language maybe being somewhat underway? And just curious what you're seeing with the user trends in -- maybe in France or rather French-speaking countries? And then maybe for Drew or Jen, very early days in data licensing and I think we're all very interested in it. And just curious, the early learnings, either financially or the potential with the product. Any thoughts there would be really helpful. Thank you.\nSteve Huffman: Thanks. Great question. So the first one on translation. So one of the things, I think, that's most exciting for us with large language model, is the ability to do translation at human level quality. This was just quite simply technology that didn't really exist a year ago. And now we can translate Reddit\u2019s entire corpus into another language. And so French is, the first language we're doing in the stand. It's in testing now, and the results are looking very promising. And so if you're a user in France, in this test group, you can see all of them, including like big blue-chip communities like AskReddit, entirely in French. And so this is leading to -- as we would hope, improved retention and time on site and then growth among these users. And they're also seeing this content get indexed by French language Google. And so we start to see new users coming to that content as well. And so I think really promising start here. We're going to do more languages this year. As we get the product polished, the next one would be Spanish, which I think represents a pretty big opportunity. So this is very exciting. I think I keep saying everybody has a home on Reddit today, that's a true statement if you speak English, but we want to make that a true statement for everyone in the world. I think it's not a matter of if but when, but we want to make that wanas fast as possible. And so I think this represents our best shot at dramatically accelerating our growth outside the U.S. in the non-English markets. Second question was about data licensing for start with Jen.\nJen Wong: Thanks, Steve. So on data licensing, Steve mentioned truly a barbell business where one part of the business is well-established markets, things like social listening, maybe the financial markets. In social listening, I think we've learned there's clearly an established market. There's interest embedded data for insights that lead to business decision-making, marketing decision-making. And it is a new market that I think has potential to grow over time, but it's a lot of players and a lot of players in sort of smaller deals but established market. I'd say another learning is in the barbell side will take certain verticals like finance, et cetera, which are a little bit outside of our domain potentially working with partners who have accessed the distribution is very interesting to us as we learn those markets. So that's something that we're thinking about. On the other side of the barbell are fewer deals, fewer partners and probably a handful, but larger are the folks who are AI model builders. And on that side, I'd say these are midterm deals is how we think about them because it's such a nascent and early market that we want to see how things unfold or not forever, but wants to understand value. User privacy is very important to us, and that's very important in how we craft these partnerships and consider partnerships, making sure that users when they have edits and deletions are respected is very important to us. I'd say partners where we're not competitive and where we can grow together. It's not always the case. And so we just want to be sure that the partners are right fit even over the midterm. So those are the things that I think we've learned in the, I'd say, the AI partnerships that were sort of more selective given all of those pieces. Drew Vollero, do you want to add?\nDrew Vollero: Yes, let me add two things on the financial side, Tom, both positives. I think as Jen said in the barbell market, it's been nice to see on the smaller side. There are seven figure deals available there. And so that's been nice to see the team work hard and get those done. So that's been a benefit for a company like ours. And then the other piece is just sort of the cost of putting together the data as we're pulling it. It's a high gross margin business to begin with. This has really been accretive to our business that the cost of preparing the data is probably a little less than we thought it would be and really flows through quite well in the P&L is one of the keys to success that you see in our first quarter numbers.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from Lightshed Partners. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRichard Greenfield: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to follow-up, Steve, on your answer about Google. You really talked about how Google indexing for AI will ultimately be good for Reddit in the long-term. But I guess what I'd love to recall or help understand is when consumers are using AI plus, like I go on ChatGPT or I go on Gemini. And when I'm searching for something, I'm sure I'm getting content that I believe is coming from Reddit, but it doesn't say this came from Reddit this -- like when I go to Google and do a Google search, I get a very clear set of links and say, these are from Reddit and I click in and I go to a Reddit page, that doesn't happen in AI. Will that happen in AI? Is that the future that we see? And I'm just trying to understand traffic, this traffic end up slowing to things like Reddit.com and to your app versus these applications where you're making money, how do you see this evolving? Because I think it obviously is impactful to your brand and what your brand means to the consumer?\nSteve Huffman : Thanks, Rich. Good question. Look, when we do these agreements and the ones we have so far are very clear that if you're using Reddit data in an answer like in your example, you have to link of Reddit or you have to say ready, you have to use our branding, you have to link to us. And I think that's -- it's really important to your point. We are studying from a position of we would like Reddit to be out there. I think it's good for the consumer. I think it's been good for our platform. We've lived that for a long time in search. And I think of the AI products that we know today as really extensions of search, right, users are typing into a box, what they're interested in and getting access. Now will people be able to take Reddit's data, not send any users to us, take credit for themselves in and risk themselves going forward? The answer is no. I think our historical way of handling public data no longer works, right? In the past, I think crawling Reddit benefited the whole ecosystem, including users on our platform as we said. But increasingly, we are seeing folks who hoard public data and they use it to enrich themselves. So we're open-minded about having relationships with companies like this and being included in search and used for training, but it will come with guardrails, with agreements that protect our platform and our users. Similarly, in the past, Reddit has been open for research, and we want to preserve that. And so I think there are uses of Reddit data outside of Reddit data are really important. And I do want to be clear, under no circumstances will we ever license behavioral data or data that is not already public. But I think these guardrails are really important. And so look, we're open and we're open for business, but we're not just going to give it away. And I don't think companies that have taken or continue to take our data can expect to continue to do so with no repercussion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Shmulik from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMark Shmulik : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Just a longer-term strategy one as we kind of get our first visual of Reddit as a public company. But as you think about all the different efforts that you've kind of shared underway around advertiser diversification, more ad products, the user economy, data licensing efforts. Any way to think through dimensionalizing how you're thinking about prioritizing investments across all those monetization initiatives? Thanks.\nSteve Huffman : Yes. Look, I'll start and see if Jen and Drew have anything to add. Our top priority and where most of our resources go is the core of Reddit. And so this is the community and conversation platform our apps on the website and then the ad business. I think there's a tremendous amount of potential in this area. So, I think we can grow users quite significantly, both in the U.S. and even more so outside the U.S. And then we've got a long way to go on that. I think we're very happy with the progress. But really, it still feels like we're at the beginning of our journey. There's just so much upside. And so that's the core of what we do and how we think about the future. And then kind of our next couple of chapters, yes, the user economy and developer platform and the search opportunity. So, I think of this as like a 70/20/10 model. 70% on the core of our business, and then the rest on these future initiatives. Now, the things for our future initiatives, user economy, developer platform search, they're pretty down the fairway for Reddit, I think, are very sensible opportunities to expand the platform and to grow our business. And so it's not too far afield, I think all these things kind of fit together in a nice way. And of course, the other big opportunity, right, the international growth machine translation, I put that in the core, but it has a tremendous amount of upside itself. Jen, Drew, what would you add?\nDrew Vollero: From here, Steve, I would just add that the margin profile of the business just really encourages investments. We have so many things that I think sort of lead us to want to invest in this business, at least in -- we think of our business as a three-legged stool, right, in terms of ad revenues and licensing revenues and then kind of the user economy piece, but at least in the first two. I mean you've got a great collection of high-margin immediate payback, no capital. Like that's way the ad businesses and that's where we're finding the licensing business here. The investments are really headcount-driven. And so those are just easy businesses to track. It's easy to see from an accountability perspective, what you're progressing here. But the high gross margins give you a good chance for the payback, the immediate term, you can course correct if you need to. It really does sort of set yourself up to really look for the right investments and accelerate the revenue growth rate. That's how we think about things sort of conceptually. Now, the third leg of the stool as it relates to the development platform, the user economy, that's coming together now. And so we'll see what that ends up being. Right now, we're doing kind of more product market fit work. But overall, just the dynamic of the first two pieces of business, Steve, I think are just really unique and special in the sense that they're short-term, high margin, no capital, those are really financially easy places to invest where you can see your payback quickly and course correct if you need to.\nOperator: Our last question today will come from Andrew Boone from JMP Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nAndrew Boone: Thanks much for taking my questions. Two, please. The first for Jen, you talked earlier about feeling the business and adding diversity as a key area of focus. Can you just talk about your progress here, especially given the strength that you saw in SMBs this last quarter, I think there was 50% growth in the skilled business area? And then, Steve, a bigger picture question. Videos one of the key trends across in-app time spent at launch. Can you talk about how you think about video and how you're corporate video onto the platform? Thanks so much.\nJen Wong: I could take the first piece. You're diversifying on multiple fronts. Number one, in terms of geography, growing our monthly active advertisers outside of the U.S. Number two, in terms of advertiser size. So the scale channel, which is mid-market advertisers and SMBs, we saw strength in Q1 in an area of investment for us. But I like about those advertisers is, they really start at the mid-funnel, and they tend to be more performance-oriented. And I think they're benefiting from some of the performance improvements we made in the top line. And there are just thousands more advertisers in that segment that can be on Reddit. So that is something we continue to work against. We are adding and growing our monthly active advertiser count in that segment. That's a focus for us as well. And then verticals. Verticals is something over the last 12 to 18 months, we expanded into and continue to have a lot of opportunity in our large customer segment. While we touch top 300 advertisers, a lot of these have multiple business lines. And we're only penetrated in a handful. And so there's just a lot more opportunity in sub-brands and sub-businesses and even in that segment as we grow out the different verticals. And so we see segments like Finance and Pharma and CPG growing 50% year-over-year, just is a signal that there's just a lot of opportunity there. So it's a priority for us. We are growing at monthly active advertisers. And I think that scale segment in particular, there's just thousands more advertisers into our platform. A - Okay. And that's for video. As you say video is obviously huge, important content side on the Internet. I'd say, the way we think about that Reddit, looks there is different for what's worth, Video is one of our fastest-growing content types. More-and-more people spend more-and-more time on video on Reddit. But I do -- I think from a product point of view, try to think of Reddit as being content type agnostic, that is whatever type of content that users want to use to communicate or tell stories, they should be able to do so on Reddit. And so look, we've put a ton of effort into -- in the last year of just the quality of our video player, making going in and out of video from our feed, making just the day-to-day experience of watching video on Reddit better. And we've got some nice updates coming even in the near future towards that end. But with images, static images and tax are also hugely important to Reddit. And so a lot of our effort is how do we bring these things together in harmony. And so I'd say the core Retit product is parts of that are still under construction right now, making a mixed media feed, work really well, were text and links and hold their own alongside video and gifts and ads. That's been really important to us. I think we've made some progress, but I also think there's plenty of room for improvement there. So we're going to -- my answer is similar to my answer on search. I think we'll make the video playing and creation experience on Reddit better. And when the product is really performing well, then I think we can start talking about monetization. Obviously, it's a huge monetization potential on Reddit. So we'll get there before long, but our focus right now is on making the consumption and creation experience better. I think there's plenty of to improvement. Okay. I think we're at the top of the hour here, folks. Thank you so much for your time and attention. It's really exciting to be here, I think, for our first public earnings calls, but the folks who have been with us helping us do this for so long. Again, we're so grateful. And we will talk again soon. Thanks, folks. Bye.\nOperator: This concludes Reddit's Q1 2024 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Huffman",
            "content": "Thanks, Jesse. Hi, everyone. I'm Steve Reddit's Co-Founder and CEO, and I'll be kicking things off for us today. Welcome to our first earnings call as a public company. I'd like to start off by saying thank you for spending a bit of your time with us today. We believe that great companies are built in the public markets, and we're proud to have made the transition this quarter. Our IPO was an important moment for the company. And I want to say thank you to our employees, our users and investors who all made it possible. And I also want to say welcome to our new investors, particularly to our new user investors for users to be able to own some of Reddit has long been dream of mine. Starting today and going forward, we want to include the community in this process. Our current plan will be to answer a few of the questions on this call, and then we'll do a few more on RDDT subreddit after this call. This process will likely evolve as we go forward. I also want to acknowledge the research analysts who have been with us on this journey, helping us to prepare by not doing just one but eight practice earnings calls over the last two years. Very much appreciated. Thank you. We're happy with our progress this quarter. More people are visiting Reddit than ever before. Users grew 37% year-over-year in the first quarter. We averaged over 80 million users daily and 300 million users weekly, and we grew across logged in, logged out and within the US and abroad. The most reliable way for us to grow Reddit is to make Reddit better. As such, our primary focus this year is to continue to make Reddit faster, easier to use and safer. Our new web platform, Shreddit is up to 100% of users, and it's more than twice as fast as the platform that replaces, feed equals retention, retention equals growth. We also recently updated our native apps with instant comment loading, comments and conversation at the heart of Reddit and we made it faster and easier for users to join in. Our investments in machine learning and AI will continue to improve relevance, engagement and moderation. We have and will continue to use machine learning to improve our ability to help users find communities they'll love, which in turn increases engagement across the platform. And for moderation, we've trained our own large language models that have dramatically reduced the time required for communities to enforce their own rules. We're in testing with this in a couple of communities right now, and we'll be rolling out more broadly soon. And to grow outside the US, we're using machine translation to unlock our mostly English corpus. We believe this will not only drive growth in the near-term, but also over time, will allow users from all over the world to connect regardless of the languages they speak. Now turning to some of our emerging areas as we think about the next generation of Reddit. A few of the initiatives we have here are the user economy, developer platform and search. The user economy refers to a family of features that will allow users to spend and earn money on Reddit. Launching soon is a revamped version of user awards and Reddit Gold, which is our virtual currency that enables both of these things. And our developer platform, third party developers will be able to push the boundaries of what subreddit can be, and we're excited with the early progress here. For example, wallstreetbets has livestock tickers for training stocks and a number of sports subreddit have built live scoreboards to track gain. Historically, the value of Reddit for users has been in conversation about recent topics, but with improvements to on-platform search, we can unlock the huge amount of latent value in past content, including all the answers, reviews, and advice that we have, and we're going to continue to invest here. It's an exciting time. The technology landscape is evolving and Reddit is becoming more important and valuable. Reddit is one of the largest places for authentic connection and conversation online, and more and more people are discovering and appreciating this. We believe Reddit is more important now than ever before, not only as an alternative to traditional social media, but as we enter the AI era where the value of our corpus continues to grow. The paradox I see is that as more content on the Internet is written by machines, there's an increasing premium on content that comes from real people. And we have nearly two decades of authentic conversation, unique perspectives, earnest advice, honest reviews and answers the questions about every topic imaginable. There are multiple ways, Reddit benefits from the evolving ecosystem, and we're still in the early stages of exploring use cases for Reddit data. This includes both internally to improve the platform and experience for users and externally through partnerships. We remain committed to the open Internet, but we need to be considered of where Redistata ends up and what it's used for. And we need to find the right balance between open and fair and respectful of our users. To wrap up, this was a strong start of the year for Reddit and we're executing better than ever. We see so much opportunity and could not be more excited about our future. Thanks again for taking time with us today. And now, I'll hand it over to Jen. Thanks, Drew. Thanks, Jen. Okay. We're going to take a couple of questions from the community quickly, and then we'll turn it over to the call here. The first question from the community, how are your initiatives going in terms of licensing data for AI data models, plans to expand beyond Google? The short answer is yes. But we're being considered and selective with our partners, especially for the larger scale search and training deals. We need to be very considerate of where our data goes and what it's being used for. I can't comment on deals that are under negotiation, but the landscape is bifurcated. There are a handful of large players and then there are many more smaller opportunities, and we're looking in above. That said, not all plays an ecosystem. I think are good fits for Reddit. We're in early days here. I'd say, big picture, we have seen an increase in interest in Reddit/stata for various uses. And so we'll see -- look forward to how this grows looking forward. Sure, sure. Thanks. So user growth, we're happy with the results. The main driver of growth is the product is better. And so yes, we mentioned D Steve Huffman Shred- It performance, both equals retention for users. Web performance also has been driving an increase in traffic from Google, which is driving the increase largely in the logged-out users. But logged-in users, which is the core of our business, the bedrock of our inventory is also up 27% year-over-year. And the growth there is really driven by improvements to product quality. So the sign-up has gotten much more efficient, onboarding has gotten better than home feed relevance for users, finding content that's relevant to them in their first session on Reddit. We've gotten much more effective at that. We feel confident looking forward because the growth that we've seen isn't a -- it's not like a onetime spike. We've been adding users very consistently for the last year, roughly two million users a month, seven of the last 10 months, and one million users in eight of the 10 last month. And so long story short, our work is working of focusing on product performance and quality, and that's driving retention. And so the other thing we're looking forward to as we go forward is international growth. We're still 50/50 US versus non-US but our peers are more 80% to 90% non-US. And so I think there's a huge opportunity there. I think one of the big unlocks for us in the near to medium-term is machine translation. So we're translating our entire corpus that's today mostly in English and the other languages and hope that, that will help accelerate international growth. Jen, Drew, do you want to comment on the second half of the year outlook? Sure, thanks. So first question is on on-platform search. So like a ton of our users run searches in their first session on Reddit. And so when I talk about one of the biggest challenges and opportunities we face being helping users find their home on Reddit, many of them are typing into a box exactly what they're interested in. And so I think just from a user experience point of view, on-platform search on Reddit being great is a huge opportunity. Now today we do over a billion queries per month on Reddit, but I think there's an opportunity for quite a bit more. So we've been investing in our search back end, some quality of life features like fail track and autocomplete are coming online as we speak. We've got some, I think, very sensible and overdue improvements to the user interface coming up this year as well. And then as the search product itself gets better, of course, then there's an opportunity to monetize those pages. So there are no ads today on search result pages. But that's obviously a very high-performing product elsewhere on the Internet. And I think there's no reason to believe that it wouldn't be for Reddit as well because the intention is so explicit when users are searching. So first step, improve the product for users. And then I think when we feel like we have a good foundation there, we'll start looking at monetization. Drew, I think the next question was investment philosophy? Sure, Brian, it's Steve. So look, the biggest factor driving user growth is the performance and product quality, because that's what's driving retention. And so retention compounds into growth over time. Yes, we're seeing a tailwind from Google, and you can see that in our logged out numbers. But that's not the agreement we have with Google around the data training that has nothing to do with traffic. I think really the most -- the biggest driver of uptick in traffic from Google is also performance. Google bot like speed, it keeps track of the performance of the pages at crawls. And we made those pages in some cases, more than twice as fast, in some cases, up to five times as fast. And so that has a huge improvement in ranking. We do see algorithm changes from Google. Usually, you can expect maybe two a year. But sometimes they help sometimes they hurt. So you'll never hear us celebrating or complaining about those. But you can see the consistency in our growth for the last year, but over $1 million a month, basically for the last year. And so that -- I think that's been really strong and consistent and speaks to the foundational improvements. And then I think there's a secular trend that benefits at it, which is in the AI era, people value authentic content more, right, content written by humans, and that's what Reddit is, and that's what Reddit has. And so I think there's a thirst for authentic opinions and advice and commentary and just conversations. And so I think that's the kind of irony of the technology shift that we're going through is it's the value of humans and fresh ideas continues to grow. Now in terms of the Google experiences, how their product impacts Reddit, that's one of the things we're considered if when we do any sort of deal, which is like how do you display Reddit data making sure that folks linked to us and that sort of thing. And so look, I feel pretty confident in how this will play out. Like we've been a beneficiary of Reddit being in search and in Google for a long time. And so I think Reddit being well indexed is good for our respective companies, but most importantly, it's good for the end user who gets to find the answers to their questions. It brings new users to Reddit, it helps them find their home on Reddit. And so I think Google is getting better and better at displaying our content can only help. And we've seen that play out for over a decade now. Sure. So on users, the credit has long had a massive top of funnel. We've been reporting more than 500 million monthly users for quite some time. Now we only update that user -- that number periodically, because we really run the business on dailies and weeklies. And so -- but the way we think about it is we need to improve user retention. And we're pretty confident that, just to every user on the Internet is going to bounce off read periodically, whether it's through search or a word of mouth or this or that. The challenge to us is can we retain those users. And so that's why our focus has been on quality, performance onboarding. And so we've seen really nice improvement to new user retention and user reselections and so bringing old users back. And so those are the input metrics that we really look at when we're building new products and those compounds and the growth. So that's why I keep saying, I think what we've done has made improvements to the foundation. And we get to mine those improvements for some time as opposed to this is maybe a one-time shift or things. We had a good quarter. The product is simply better, and we're benefiting from that now. Okay. Second question, I think, Drew, was on guidance. Thanks for the questions, Ben. So first, developer platform, yes, I am very excited about it. But I would actually frame the developer platform as a relative near-term opportunity. We've got a couple of hundred developers playing with it now, some of their work is in production as we speak, so some of the kind of scoreboards and stock tickers and things like that. But we can see in development, another level of interactivity. Our goal is to get this fully open. So all of the developers off our waitlist and there's thousands really like tell it this summer. And then started getting the monetization features in there later this year. And so I think there's a lot of opportunity there, all hands on deck trying to bring this to market. So I think the developer platform and the new Red gold in the user economy, kind of, dovetail together really nicely later this year. In terms of the dynamic between Logged-out and Logged-in, yes, the bedrock of our business today is Logged-in users. And we see plenty of Logged-out users, particularly from Google. But I don't think from a product point of view, the best strategy for us is to try to convert a Logged-out user into a Logged-in user in any particular session. They're usually coming from search, they have a question and we need to give what they're looking for as an answer, and we want to give them that answer. Now I would look at the total DAU as the \u2013 look I think of that as like opportunity down the road. Those are users. Those are human beings that are on the Reddit platform for various reasons. We just know that in any particular session, not everybody is looking to join a community and have a profound experience. Sometimes I just want an answer to the question, and that's okay. The other thing I think that's really important is that we grow our ability to monetize Logged-out users. Most of them are landing on what we call a post detail page or a comment page. So it's a very specific page. In many cases, it's talking about a specific product. Now there isn't admin on that page, but I'd say we're still in early days there, getting advertiser density so that we can have a well-targeted ad on all of those pages. And so I think there's lots of potential in monetizing Logged-out users. So in summary, I'd look at it, the Logged-out users today represent potential for future Logged-in users. They also represent potential and monetization in their own right as well. But from a product point of view, we focus on the Logged-out users having a great experience to what they're trying to do, and when a user hits us opening the app for the first time or coming to our front page, really focusing on giving them a great experience to maximize their retention. Thanks. Great question. So the first one on translation. So one of the things, I think, that's most exciting for us with large language model, is the ability to do translation at human level quality. This was just quite simply technology that didn't really exist a year ago. And now we can translate Reddit's entire corpus into another language. And so French is, the first language we're doing in the stand. It's in testing now, and the results are looking very promising. And so if you're a user in France, in this test group, you can see all of them, including like big blue-chip communities like AskReddit, entirely in French. And so this is leading to -- as we would hope, improved retention and time on site and then growth among these users. And they're also seeing this content get indexed by French language Google. And so we start to see new users coming to that content as well. And so I think really promising start here. We're going to do more languages this year. As we get the product polished, the next one would be Spanish, which I think represents a pretty big opportunity. So this is very exciting. I think I keep saying everybody has a home on Reddit today, that's a true statement if you speak English, but we want to make that a true statement for everyone in the world. I think it's not a matter of if but when, but we want to make that wanas fast as possible. And so I think this represents our best shot at dramatically accelerating our growth outside the U.S. in the non-English markets. Second question was about data licensing for start with Jen. Thanks, Rich. Good question. Look, when we do these agreements and the ones we have so far are very clear that if you're using Reddit data in an answer like in your example, you have to link of Reddit or you have to say ready, you have to use our branding, you have to link to us. And I think that's -- it's really important to your point. We are studying from a position of we would like Reddit to be out there. I think it's good for the consumer. I think it's been good for our platform. We've lived that for a long time in search. And I think of the AI products that we know today as really extensions of search, right, users are typing into a box, what they're interested in and getting access. Now will people be able to take Reddit's data, not send any users to us, take credit for themselves in and risk themselves going forward? The answer is no. I think our historical way of handling public data no longer works, right? In the past, I think crawling Reddit benefited the whole ecosystem, including users on our platform as we said. But increasingly, we are seeing folks who hoard public data and they use it to enrich themselves. So we're open-minded about having relationships with companies like this and being included in search and used for training, but it will come with guardrails, with agreements that protect our platform and our users. Similarly, in the past, Reddit has been open for research, and we want to preserve that. And so I think there are uses of Reddit data outside of Reddit data are really important. And I do want to be clear, under no circumstances will we ever license behavioral data or data that is not already public. But I think these guardrails are really important. And so look, we're open and we're open for business, but we're not just going to give it away. And I don't think companies that have taken or continue to take our data can expect to continue to do so with no repercussion. Yes. Look, I'll start and see if Jen and Drew have anything to add. Our top priority and where most of our resources go is the core of Reddit. And so this is the community and conversation platform our apps on the website and then the ad business. I think there's a tremendous amount of potential in this area. So, I think we can grow users quite significantly, both in the U.S. and even more so outside the U.S. And then we've got a long way to go on that. I think we're very happy with the progress. But really, it still feels like we're at the beginning of our journey. There's just so much upside. And so that's the core of what we do and how we think about the future. And then kind of our next couple of chapters, yes, the user economy and developer platform and the search opportunity. So, I think of this as like a 70/20/10 model. 70% on the core of our business, and then the rest on these future initiatives. Now, the things for our future initiatives, user economy, developer platform search, they're pretty down the fairway for Reddit, I think, are very sensible opportunities to expand the platform and to grow our business. And so it's not too far afield, I think all these things kind of fit together in a nice way. And of course, the other big opportunity, right, the international growth machine translation, I put that in the core, but it has a tremendous amount of upside itself. Jen, Drew, what would you add?"

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Drew Vollero",
            "content": "Thank you, Jen, and good afternoon, everyone. As we often say, Reddit has a powerful financial model that's straightforward, advantaged and scalable. The power of the financial model was evident in the first quarter, we reached an important inflection point. In the first quarter, we were adjusted EBITDA profitable, which is both a marked difference from a year ago and a positive start to 2024. The key to that success was that revenue grew over 5x as fast as total adjusted costs. In the quarter, revenues grew 48% year-over-year and total adjusted costs grew 9% year-over-year. Let's summarize the highlights. AUQ averaged $82.7 million, up 37% year-over-year, driven by structural product changes that have increased speed, onboarding, simplicity and consumer connection to more relevant content. Domestic users were 50% of total users in the quarter, logged-in users were about 48% of the user base. Sequentially, we added 9.6 million users in the quarter, our largest increase in 3 years, with 60% -- with over 60% of those users being logged out. Revenues were $243 million, up 48% year-over-year, driven by both a strong acceleration in the ad business and the incremental data licensing revenue from new large and small deals. Other revenue was $20 million in the quarter, up 454% from last year. International revenues were $43 million, up 30% year-over-year and 18% of total revenue. Reddit's business model has a couple of distinct advantages, which really shined in the quarter in 2 areas. First, our gross margins remain best-in-class. Gross margins were 88.6% in the first quarter, up 500 basis points versus last year, driven by high-margin revenue gains, lower hosting contract prices, tax dep efficiencies and the accretive margin tailwind for the new data licensing deals. Second, our CapEx remains very light. CapEx was about $3 million in the first quarter and just over 1% of revenue. Low CapEx was a contributing factor to our positive free cash flow that was $29 million in the quarter. As we scaled our business, we saw great operating leverage in two areas: first was leverage in operating expenses and headcount. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10% year-over-year, as we continue to hire selectively in strategic areas, such as sales, ad tech and machine learning. Total Q1 ending headcount increased 2% sequentially and 4% year-over-year. Second was operating leverage on incremental sales. In Q1, revenue increased approximately $79 million year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA increased about $60 million year-over-year, implying that over $0.75 on the incremental sales dollar reached the bottom line in the first quarter. These highly profitable incremental revenue dollars really helped drive positive free cash flow and swim our business into profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis. That said, we did have a GAAP net loss of $575 million in Q1, driven by stock-based compensation related taxes from the IPO. Stock-based compensation, including related taxes for the quarter was $595 million, up from $13 million a year ago, driven primarily by one-time expenses related to the vesting of restricted stock units in connection with our initial public offering. On a non-GAAP basis, adjusted EBITDA was approximately $10 million in the first quarter, nearly a $60 million improvement from the first quarter of the prior year. This marks our first profitable Q1 on an adjusted EBITDA basis, which in digital advertising is traditionally the slowest quarter of the year Positive adjusted EBITDA was a strong driver of cash flow for the quarter. Cash from operating activities was $32 million in the first quarter, driven by improved performance and working capital improvements in DSO and DPO. A couple of other financial notes of interest on cash and shares. At the end of the first quarter, cash and marketable securities ended at $1.67 billion and includes all IPO proceeds at this point, dilution from employee grants was about 0.6% of our fully diluted shares outstanding, as we issued about 1.2 million shares to employees in Q1. We view stock as a cost of our business and plan to manage dilution to be in line with peers in a low single-digit percentage range over time. As we look ahead, we'll share our internal thoughts on revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter, which is where we have the greatest visibility. In the second quarter of 2024, we estimate revenue to be in the range of $240 million to $255 million and adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $0 million to $15 million. So in summary, Q1 was a strong start to the year, with accelerated user and revenue growth and modest cost growth, which fueled solid margin expansion, adjusted EBITDA profitability and positive free cash flow. Now let me turn the call back over to Steve. Yeah. No, I think that's well said, Jen. I think that it was a good quarter for us, Ron start to finish. Even March was very strong. I think as Jen mentioned, the comps in the first quarter are a little lower than the back half of the year, they're in the 20s. We also may have picked up some momentum from the IPO, hard to say to identify that. But we did, as I said, see strength in March. Look on the cost side of things, I think we found a good rhythm right now. I think in the last four quarters, total adjusted costs have been up 5% to 15%, average 9%. I think we're really at a place where we have good scale as a company, and we're adding resources where it makes sense. I talked about adding resources in our machine learning teams in our sales teams. I think we're in a place where we have scale, and we're adding selectively. As you know, headcount is by far and away, the biggest part of our cost driver. OpEx is 85% of total costs here, total adjusted costs here at the company. So I think we feel good at least for the next couple of quarters on how we're thinking about things, but we'll see how it plays out and I echo Jen's sentiments on kind of the headwinds and tailwinds on the back half of the year and the things that we're watching. Yeah, investment philosophy. Doug, thanks for the question. Look, in terms of the investment philosophy, it didn't change here. Your point about revenue five times as fast as cost, yes, nice to see for sure. It really was about the revenue line or the numerator expanding. Last three quarters, we've averaged about 23% revenue growth. This quarter, 48. If I look at our total adjusted cost growth, last four quarters has been 9%. This quarter was 9%. So the investments in the business stayed the same or consistent with the four-quarter average. What really happened here is we were able to leverage those resources and really drive a top line that was meaningfully different, double the growth rate over the last three quarters. So I think that's really what happened in terms of that. I will tell you that's an output metric. We didn't sort of design the quarter to be that way. I think internally, long-term, Doug, we'd like our revenue growth rate to be twice as fast as our cost growth. Like, that's how we think about running this business over the long-term. But there are certainly quarters where we can do better than that, and I think the first quarter was a prime example of that. Right. Justin, high-level, we will guide on a quarterly basis, one quarter ahead, we'll do revenues. And we'll do adjusted EBITDA. That's what we're comfortable with at this time. In terms of the second quarter guide, I take your point we grew 48% in the first quarter. The midpoint of the guide is mid-30s. So there is a little bit of a -- de-cell there. Look, I think as we mentioned, it was a strong quarter for us, top to bottom. The month of March was very good for us, as I mentioned. I think we're just looking at the comps a little bit. I think that's a little bit, driving where we are at this point. The comp was, as Jen mentioned, 12% in the first quarter, the comp is 23. I do think we might have gotten a little bit of tailwind from the IPO in the first quarter. We'll see if those tailwinds continue. A couple of other things that kind of works in our favor in the first quarter, right, you get an extra day with Leap Day. The Easter was a little bit earlier, like all the things kind of worked a little bit. But overall, as Jen said, it's a good solid start to the year for us, and we'll sort of see how we do. I think bigger picture, we're keeping our eye on a couple of things, particularly geopolitics, I think that is the one thing that can affect you intra-quarter depending on sort of what the geopolitical situation is, brand advertisers can pull advertising if things aren't where they want it to be from time-to-time. So those are -- that's probably the biggest one. We're looking at inflation and elections to those are the other couple of things that we take a look at. But overall, it was a good quarter, first quarter, and we ended with momentum. We'll see how the second quarter plays out, but it really is kind of comp driven and sort of a couple of tailwinds that we have in the first quarter, we'll see if they continue the second. Yes, let me add two things on the financial side, Tom, both positives. I think as Jen said in the barbell market, it's been nice to see on the smaller side. There are seven figure deals available there. And so that's been nice to see the team work hard and get those done. So that's been a benefit for a company like ours. And then the other piece is just sort of the cost of putting together the data as we're pulling it. It's a high gross margin business to begin with. This has really been accretive to our business that the cost of preparing the data is probably a little less than we thought it would be and really flows through quite well in the P&L is one of the keys to success that you see in our first quarter numbers. From here, Steve, I would just add that the margin profile of the business just really encourages investments. We have so many things that I think sort of lead us to want to invest in this business, at least in -- we think of our business as a three-legged stool, right, in terms of ad revenues and licensing revenues and then kind of the user economy piece, but at least in the first two. I mean you've got a great collection of high-margin immediate payback, no capital. Like that's way the ad businesses and that's where we're finding the licensing business here. The investments are really headcount-driven. And so those are just easy businesses to track. It's easy to see from an accountability perspective, what you're progressing here. But the high gross margins give you a good chance for the payback, the immediate term, you can course correct if you need to. It really does sort of set yourself up to really look for the right investments and accelerate the revenue growth rate. That's how we think about things sort of conceptually. Now, the third leg of the stool as it relates to the development platform, the user economy, that's coming together now. And so we'll see what that ends up being. Right now, we're doing kind of more product market fit work. But overall, just the dynamic of the first two pieces of business, Steve, I think are just really unique and special in the sense that they're short-term, high margin, no capital, those are really financially easy places to invest where you can see your payback quickly and course correct if you need to."

            "name": "Jen Wong",
            "content": "Thanks, Steve. Hello, everyone. Our IPO was an important milestone for Reddit in our communities, and I'm thankful for everyone that helped make it possible. I couldn't be more excited about what its future as a public company. Reddit is still early in its monetization journey, I'm proud of what we have achieved to-date with our advertising business and our new and emerging businesses in data licensing and user economy. We aspire to be a leader in contextual and inter-space advertising. And every day, we are working to improve our advertiser solutions and bring new advertisers to the platform. In the first quarter, we successfully scaled and diversified our business, expanded partnerships, and executed on our ads platform roadmap. Total revenue growth accelerated in the first quarter and grew by 48% year-over-year to $243 million, the fastest year-over-year growth since Q1 2022. We continue to see traction with our strategies alongside a more favorable ad market versus last year and made progress in our emerging data licensing business. Total U.S. revenue grew 53% and international revenue grew 30% year-over-year. International revenue represented 18% of total revenue in Q1. Advertising revenue grew 39% year-over-year to $223 million, the third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth year-over-year. Other revenue grew over 450% year-over-year to $20 million, primarily driven by new data licensing agreements we signed in the first quarter. I'll first discuss our ad revenue drivers. Our investments enabled us to drive performance for advertisers. Click volume doubled and we improved click-through rates by over 40% year-over-year in the quarter. Our full suite of solutions across the marketing funnel continue to position us well for a broad set of advertisers. Our performance advertising business, which drives traffic and conversions, drove more than half of our growth in the quarter. Ad revenue growth was primarily driven by increases in impressions delivered against a year-over-year decline in pricing. We saw revenue growth across all of our managed channels. Our scale business, mid-market, and SMB grew at a faster pace than total revenue. This is an investment area for us and was in line with our expectations. Our large customer service channel, which accounted for slightly over 60% of total revenue saw broad-based growth. Looking at verticals, the tech vertical returned to growth and we experienced particular strength in the finance, pharma, and CPG categories, each growing over 50% year-over-year. I'm pleased with our progress to diversify our revenue. And in Q1, there is no vertical that exceeds 20% of our ad revenue today. In terms of geography, international revenue increased 30% year-over-year to $43 billion in the first quarter, an acceleration from 21% year-over-year growth in Q4 last year. This was driven by strength across large and mid-market customers in EMEA. We've also made meaningful progress against our ad tech roadmap. Here, we've our focus on a few key pillars; number one, improving usability for our advertisers and productivity of our sales force; number two, driving full funnel performance of our ad solutions; and number three, offering our advertisers Reddit unique solutions and creative that they can't find anywhere else. So, first, to improve usability for advertisers, we focus on cutting down the campaign setup time for self-serve and small businesses. We're using advancements in AI to remove friction and reduce set of time. We launched an AI-driven headline generator for Simple Create, which is namely the self-serve creation flow for small businesses, and we're seeing promising early activation and adoption rates. Next, to improve performance and measurability of our ad solutions, we made progress building out our conversion API ecosystem to capture more signals and improve our models that drive performance. We launched our [indiscernible] late last year and this quarter, we announced integrations with [indiscernible], a leading customer data platform and Google Tag Manager. We continue to innovate with our ad products to bring our advertisers closer to our communities. We launched free-formats, which provides advertisers with a versatile and creative format to drive deeper engagement with users. Testing has shown that free-formats have a meaningfully higher click-through rate than other ad types, and we've seen double the number of campaigns per day since its launch. We also launched Reddit Pro, a free suite of AI-powered insights and tools to provide businesses an opportunity to establish and grow a meaningful organic presence on Reddit. We're currently in beta with over 1,000 businesses, including Taco Bell, Wendy's, NFL, the Wall Street Journal as well as several SMBs. We're also continuing to lay the foundation for the future of shopping on Reddit. Users come to Reddit during their purchasing journey and value the rich human-powered product and review discussions on our platform. We launched our first shopping ads and catalog ingest capabilities last year and are now testing dynamic product ads. We're pleased with the early results. Next, I'll share an update on our data licensing business. Our data licensing business continues to grow and evolve as the market is still nascent. In the first quarter, we signed licensing agreements with various companies in the social listening space and with Google as we previously announced. The financial impact of the signed partnerships are reflected in our Q1 financials as other revenue and in our revenue guide for Q2, which you'll hear from Drew shortly. Over time, we will strategically explore data licensing partnerships, as well as other uses for Reddit data internally, which we believe is also valuable in improving the platform and experience for our users and customers. Overall, we delivered solid results in our first quarter as a public company and remain focused on executing and fulfilling our mission. I hope you share the same excitement that we have in Reddit's future and look forward to the journey ahead. Now I'll turn the call over to Drew. Sure. Thanks for the question. We actually saw growth in both supply and demand. Let me talk about the demand side. So across the funnel, we saw -- we saw growth across the funnel sort of the Brand upper funnel, mid-funnel which is traffic driving as well as the bottom of the funnel, which is driving conversion. Brand, in particular, had a nice quarter and showed strength, certainly relative to -- I think Q1 2022 was the last really strong Brand quarter. So it was really nice to see Brand come back. And mid is doing really well because we have made those improvements in CTR, 40% year-over-year, doubling click volumes, a lot of efficiency for advertisers. We also saw broad-based strength across the managed channels, particularly in mid-market and our large customer channel in North America and Continental Europe. And then we have strength in verticals like finance, pharma, CPG and tech return to growth. On the supply side, while designing new ad placement is an opportunity. These -- our inventory today really consists of two core ad types. It's the ad in the feed and the ad in the conversations with the comment page. We did see strong growth in conversation placement inventory from users spending more time reading comments and diving deeper, as well as from some ad platform work. So both supply and demand were helpful in drivers in our business. Yeah, I'll kick it off and then pass to Drew. Look, market is healthy brand advertising, its strong as it's been since 2022. We're feeling good in many parts of our business are working well in Q1 in the first half and are well-positioned for the second half. So our strategies are gaining traction. Adds, I like the vertical diversification. We like the accelerated growth in the mid-market channel and both in North America and in coming in Europe. So a lot of positive traction. The reality is Q1 had an easier comp, the 12% year-over-year growth from Q1, 2023. We did a low visibility into the second half. And 80% of our revenue is in the US and there is a US election, which could impact our advertisers like campaigns, especially brand advertisers. And there's also inflation, geopolitical context and some type of comps in Q3, Q4. But we feel like we've had a really solid start for strategy gaining traction. We feel good, but we just have a low visibility back end of the year. Let me pass to Drew to add some more color. Thanks for the question. Yes, I'd say\u2013 I think our aspiration to be a leader in contextual interstates advertising is very differentiated, and it resonates with all of our advertising partners. And the idea that Reddit can be a full-funnel solution, I think it is very attractive, and we've made good progress against that. And we started at the top of the funnel with brand. I think we have really done a lot of work and delivered a lot of performance and efficiency at the mid part of the funnel with the continuing growth in click-through rates and click volume. And now with launches like Dynamic Product Ads and you had the catalog in jest last year and the work we're doing in [indiscernible] conversions at the bottom end of the funnel, I think the advertisers see how serious we are in delivering value at the bottom end of the funnel. So this idea of being full funnel and being differentiated in terms of our targeting capabilities, I think, is really resonating. We are focused on laying down signals for the bottom end of the funnel. So you see the work we did with a group of ad manager partnership and Helium. We'll look at more of those. So cap being conversion is going incredibly important \u2013 signals into the models that we're building at the bottom end of the funnel. And just working with advertisers to start testing spend against these solutions and continue to iterate. So I think there's real excitement about, wow, you're doing great in brand and mid-funnel and now the lower end of the funnel is potentially going to open up for us to go truly full funnel. That's really, really exciting. So that's where our advertisers are, I think, particularly excited about to just have an additional objective. Thanks, Steve. So on data licensing, Steve mentioned truly a barbell business where one part of the business is well-established markets, things like social listening, maybe the financial markets. In social listening, I think we've learned there's clearly an established market. There's interest embedded data for insights that lead to business decision-making, marketing decision-making. And it is a new market that I think has potential to grow over time, but it's a lot of players and a lot of players in sort of smaller deals but established market. I'd say another learning is in the barbell side will take certain verticals like finance, et cetera, which are a little bit outside of our domain potentially working with partners who have accessed the distribution is very interesting to us as we learn those markets. So that's something that we're thinking about. On the other side of the barbell are fewer deals, fewer partners and probably a handful, but larger are the folks who are AI model builders. And on that side, I'd say these are midterm deals is how we think about them because it's such a nascent and early market that we want to see how things unfold or not forever, but wants to understand value. User privacy is very important to us, and that's very important in how we craft these partnerships and consider partnerships, making sure that users when they have edits and deletions are respected is very important to us. I'd say partners where we're not competitive and where we can grow together. It's not always the case. And so we just want to be sure that the partners are right fit even over the midterm. So those are the things that I think we've learned in the, I'd say, the AI partnerships that were sort of more selective given all of those pieces. Drew Vollero, do you want to add? I could take the first piece. You're diversifying on multiple fronts. Number one, in terms of geography, growing our monthly active advertisers outside of the U.S. Number two, in terms of advertiser size. So the scale channel, which is mid-market advertisers and SMBs, we saw strength in Q1 in an area of investment for us. But I like about those advertisers is, they really start at the mid-funnel, and they tend to be more performance-oriented. And I think they're benefiting from some of the performance improvements we made in the top line. And there are just thousands more advertisers in that segment that can be on Reddit. So that is something we continue to work against. We are adding and growing our monthly active advertiser count in that segment. That's a focus for us as well. And then verticals. Verticals is something over the last 12 to 18 months, we expanded into and continue to have a lot of opportunity in our large customer segment. While we touch top 300 advertisers, a lot of these have multiple business lines. And we're only penetrated in a handful. And so there's just a lot more opportunity in sub-brands and sub-businesses and even in that segment as we grow out the different verticals. And so we see segments like Finance and Pharma and CPG growing 50% year-over-year, just is a signal that there's just a lot of opportunity there. So it's a priority for us. We are growing at monthly active advertisers. And I think that scale segment in particular, there's just thousands more advertisers into our platform. A - Okay. And that's for video. As you say video is obviously huge, important content side on the Internet. I'd say, the way we think about that Reddit, looks there is different for what's worth, Video is one of our fastest-growing content types. More-and-more people spend more-and-more time on video on Reddit. But I do -- I think from a product point of view, try to think of Reddit as being content type agnostic, that is whatever type of content that users want to use to communicate or tell stories, they should be able to do so on Reddit. And so look, we've put a ton of effort into -- in the last year of just the quality of our video player, making going in and out of video from our feed, making just the day-to-day experience of watching video on Reddit better. And we've got some nice updates coming even in the near future towards that end. But with images, static images and tax are also hugely important to Reddit. And so a lot of our effort is how do we bring these things together in harmony. And so I'd say the core Retit product is parts of that are still under construction right now, making a mixed media feed, work really well, were text and links and hold their own alongside video and gifts and ads. That's been really important to us. I think we've made some progress, but I also think there's plenty of room for improvement there. So we're going to -- my answer is similar to my answer on search. I think we'll make the video playing and creation experience on Reddit better. And when the product is really performing well, then I think we can start talking about monetization. Obviously, it's a huge monetization potential on Reddit. So we'll get there before long, but our focus right now is on making the consumption and creation experience better. I think there's plenty of to improvement. Okay. I think we're at the top of the hour here, folks. Thank you so much for your time and attention. It's really exciting to be here, I think, for our first public earnings calls, but the folks who have been with us helping us do this for so long. Again, we're so grateful. And we will talk again soon. Thanks, folks. Bye."
